       2003. Kiosks will be placed in all housing units from day one for

       country, we deliver more frequently.

       into our system are done on-line. TKC aggressively gathers data
       from inmates' family and friends and markets to them, unlike anyone
       else.
    4. Most Economic Gain: Through ALL of our features, we provide the
       MOST avenues for your county to earn money. Commissary, Video
       Visitation, Phone Integration, Inmate E-Mail and SMS, PictureMail
       plus improved employee efficiency all impact your bottom line
       revenue, productivity and morale.
    5. Performance: Our system works. We monitor our kiosks all day, every
       day and have strict guidelines set in place to maximize our
       performance. Ask about our 99.9% up-time!
