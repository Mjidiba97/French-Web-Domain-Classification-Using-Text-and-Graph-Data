   Lâ€™EFMD (European Foundation for Management Development) vient
   dâ€™attribuer son accrÃ©ditation EQUIS (European Quality Improvement
   System) Ã  Montpellier Business School (MBS). DÃ©jÃ  accrÃ©ditÃ©e AACSB et
   AMBA, lâ€™Ã‰cole rejoint le cercle trÃ¨s restreint des 1% de Business
   Schools mondiales dÃ©tentrices de la Â« triple couronne Â».

   MBS devient ainsi la 14Ã¨me Ã©cole de management franÃ§aise post-classe
   prÃ©paratoire triple accrÃ©ditÃ©e AACSB/AMBA/EQUIS, la 91^Ã¨me sur environ
   14 000 business schools dans le monde.

   Lâ€™obtention de cette accrÃ©ditation est le rÃ©sultat dâ€™un long et
   rigoureux processus dâ€™examen, qui permet dâ€™Ã©valuer la conformitÃ© dâ€™un
   Ã©tablissement Ã  des standards acadÃ©miques Ã©levÃ©s, dÃ©finis par lâ€™EFMD et
   portant sur toutes les dimensions et composantes de lâ€™institution :
   stratÃ©gie, pÃ©dagogie, recherche, internationalisation, proximitÃ© avec
   les entreprises et rÃ©seaux de diplÃ´mÃ©s. Elle sâ€™applique Ã  tous les
   programmes de lâ€™Ã©cole : Bachelor (BAC+3), Programme Grande Ecole (BAC
   +5), Masters of Science (BAC+5), Executive MBA.

   MBS sâ€™appuie sur un positionnement atypique, alliant exigence
   acadÃ©mique et empreinte RSE, qui lui a permis de se diffÃ©rencier et
   dâ€™acquÃ©rir, au fil des annÃ©es, une place Ã  part parmi les Business
   Schools franÃ§aises et internationales. Comme le prÃ©cise Bruno DUCASSE,
   Directeur GÃ©nÃ©ral de Montpellier Business School : Â« Cette nouvelle
   accrÃ©ditation est une reconnaissance de la stratÃ©gie de MBS, qui allie
   une exigence de qualitÃ© acadÃ©mique rÃ©pondant aux plus hauts standards
   mondiaux Ã  la dÃ©fense de valeurs fortes : lâ€™ouverture sociale et la
   construction dâ€™une Ã©conomie et dâ€™une sociÃ©tÃ© plus responsables. Ce
   nâ€™est quâ€™un dÃ©but, lâ€™entrÃ©e dans un nouveau processus dâ€™amÃ©lioration
   continue qui doit nous amener Ã  poursuivre notre progression. Â»

   Pour AndrÃ© Deljarry, prÃ©sident de Montpellier Business School, Â« cette
   nouvelle accrÃ©ditation place MBS dans le top 1% des business schools
   dans le monde. Câ€™est une grande fiertÃ© pour notre Ã©cole et pour notre
   territoire. Avec la triple couronne et demain un nouveau campus, MBS
   sera prÃªte Ã  entrer dans une nouvelle phase de son dÃ©veloppement. Â»

Lâ€™intÃ©gration des enjeux Ã©cologiques et sociÃ©taux est au cÅ“ur de la stratÃ©gie
de MBS depuis de nombreuses annÃ©es.

   Montpellier Business School sâ€™associe Ã  la ConfÃ©rence des Grandes
   Ecoles et endosse la tribune du RÃ©seau FranÃ§ais Etudiant pour le
   DÃ©veloppement Durable (REFEDD) qui appelle Ã  une meilleure intÃ©gration
   des enjeux climatiques et sociaux dans la stratÃ©gie des Ã©tablissements
   dâ€™enseignement supÃ©rieur.

   Montpellier Business School (MBS) soutient cette initiative collective,
   qui est en pleine adÃ©quation avec les fondements de lâ€™Ã©cole, sa
   mission et ses valeurs : former des managers responsables, capables
   dâ€™incarner lâ€™Ã©thique, lâ€™ouverture, la diversitÃ©, la responsabilitÃ© et
   la performance globale.

   Connue pour son engagement sociÃ©tal en faveur de la DiversitÃ©, MBS a
   intÃ©grÃ© toutes les dimensions de la RSE dans son fonctionnement interne
   comme dans ses enseignements depuis plusieurs annÃ©es, dans lâ€™objectif
   dâ€™Å“uvrer Ã  son Ã©chelle et Ã  travers ses Ã©tudiants et diplÃ´mÃ©s Ã  une
   sociÃ©tÃ© plus durable.



Lâ€™enseignement et la sensibilisation 360Â° aux enjeux environnementaux et
sociÃ©taux

   MBS intÃ¨gre la RSE et le dÃ©veloppement durable tant dans ses
   enseignements, oÃ¹ ces matiÃ¨res sont enseignÃ©es en transverse ainsi que
   par des cours dÃ©diÃ©s dans tous ses programmes (du Bachelor Ã 
   lâ€™exÃ©cutive MBA), que dans son fonctionnement interne.

   Les Ã©tudiants suivent ainsi des cours de RSE et DÃ©veloppement Durable,
   de Marketing Responsable, et choisissent par exemple une spÃ©cialisation
   Ã‰conomie sociale et solidaire ou de Management durable des ressources
   humaines et de la diversitÃ©.

   Tous les ans, lâ€™ensemble des Ã©tudiants de premiÃ¨re annÃ©e des programmes
   Bachelor et Grande Ecole participent aux projets solidaires Alpha et
   PromÃ©thÃ©e. CoachÃ© par un collaborateur de MBS, chaque groupe sâ€™engage Ã 
   mettre en place un plan dâ€™actions pour collecter des fonds, amÃ©liorer
   la notoriÃ©tÃ© et renforcer lâ€™impact dâ€™une association.

   Lâ€™ensemble des collaborateurs et des Ã©tudiants sont Ã©galement invitÃ©s Ã 
   participer Ã  de nombreux dispositifs sensibilisant aux valeurs
   sociÃ©tales tout au long de lâ€™annÃ©e. En 2019, la Semaine de la
   ResponsabilitÃ© Globale a organisÃ© des ateliers et confÃ©rences de
   sensibilisation Ã  la disparition de la faune et a ainsi ouvert sur de
   nouveaux dispositifs Ã©conomiques pour fonder son entreprise sans mettre
   en danger son Ã©cosystÃ¨me.

Sâ€™engager pour lâ€™avenir en soutenant la recherche durable

   A MBS plusieurs chaires et groupes de recherche interdisciplinaires
   travaillent sur les champs de la RSE.

   La Chaire Ã©nergie et dÃ©veloppement durable qui organise la confÃ©rence
   annuelle â€œInternational Conference on Energy, Finance and Macroeconomy
   (ICEFM)â€, rÃ©unit des chercheurs et acteurs du monde entier autour des
   derniÃ¨res dÃ©couvertes de ces trois domaines.

   La Chaire Entrepreneuriat Social & Inclusion a pour objectif de
   promouvoir les entreprises de lâ€™Ã©conomie sociale et solidaire et Ã 
   soutenir les personnes Ã©loignÃ©es de lâ€™emploi afin de contribuer Ã  une
   Ã©conomie plus inclusive.

   La Chaire en microfinance se consacre Ã©galement Ã  lâ€™inclusion via la
   microfinance, en particulier dans les pays dÃ©veloppÃ©s, sensibilise les
   Ã©tudiants au Social Business et collabore avec le Professeur Muhammad
   Yunus, Prix Nobel de la Paix en 2006.

   Le groupe Â« Valeurs, Organisations, Acteurs et ResponsabilitÃ© Â» (VOAR)
   est spÃ©cialisÃ© dans les pratiques de RSE et accompagne les entreprises
   dans la mise en place de politique de dÃ©veloppement durable depuis
   plusieurs annÃ©es, comme a pu le faire le Dr. Magalie Marais au sein de
   lâ€™AssemblÃ©e nationale il y a dÃ©jÃ  deux ans.

   Enfin, le DÃ©veloppement Durable sera au cÅ“ur du cahier des charges du
   futur campus Ã©coresponsable, au bilan carbone nÃ©gatif pour un
   enseignement supÃ©rieur Ã  la hauteur des enjeux Ã©cologiques.

   Vendredi 20 septembre dernier, câ€™est devant un jury de professionnels
   que se sont affrontÃ©s les cinq derniers finalistes de la 6^Ã¨me Ã©dition
   de la Start-Up Week. Ce Business Game

   Pour cette ultime phase, lâ€™expertise de Private Sport Shop, parrain de
   lâ€™Ã©dition, a Ã©tÃ© dâ€™autant plus importante quâ€™elle ciblait un Ã©lÃ©ment
   clÃ© de leur positionnement : le sport et le digital.

Application, rÃ©alitÃ© virtuelle et algorithme : un podium sous le signe de
lâ€™innovation technologique

   Pour cette ultime semaine de Business Game, le concept reste inchangÃ© :
   cinq projets sâ€™affrontent dans une phase finale de pitchs devant
   lâ€™intÃ©gralitÃ© des Ã©tudiants et un jury dâ€™experts Ã©valuant le caractÃ¨re
   innovant, le rÃ©alisme financier et la stratÃ©gie de lancement de la
   start-up.

   Au pied du podium, on retrouve le groupe Virtual Arena qui ont choisi
   de se concentrer sur lâ€™aspect convivial et spectaculaire des grands
   Ã©vÃ©nements sportifs. Aux vues de lâ€™amÃ©lioration perpÃ©tuelle des
   retransmissions de ces manifestations, ce groupe a imaginÃ© un concept
   de Â« loge virtuelle Â» permettant dâ€™assister avec des lunettes de
   rÃ©alitÃ©s virtuelles aux compÃ©titions sportives comme si vous y Ã©tiez,
   et de se rÃ©unir en salon virtuel avec les personnes de votre choix.

   En second position, le groupe SAM (Sport Automatic Manager) a dÃ©cidÃ© de
   surfer sur la croissance du nombre dâ€™adhÃ©sions dans les salles de sport
   mais surtout sur le nombre dâ€™abandons au bout de quelques semaines. La
   raison la plus souvent citÃ©e ? Un manque de disponibilitÃ© des
   professionnels et de suivi. Ainsi, le groupe a construit un coach
   virtuel, Â« Sam Â», qui permet de suivre de maniÃ¨re autonome ses progrÃ¨s
   grÃ¢ce Ã  un algorithme.

   Cependant, le groupe qui est parvenu Ã  se hisser Ã  la premiÃ¨re marche
   du podium est Place Me, une application de mise en vente de billets
   dâ€™Ã©vÃ©nements sportifs, entre particuliers et en last minute. Le projet
   est nÃ© du dÃ©ficit du taux de remplissage des stades : 70% des siÃ¨ges
   sont effectivement occupÃ©s lorsque 100% des places ont pourtant Ã©tÃ©
   vendues. Lâ€™application permet alors de mettre en relation les
   passionnÃ©s, de digitaliser son billet et de le revendre en direct sur
   lâ€™application quelques minutes avant le match. Un concept innovant Ã 
   mi-chemin entre une plateforme e-commerce et un rÃ©seau social.

Les 16 associations et clubs Ã©tudiants de MBS recrutent leurs nouveaux
membres

   Avec lâ€™arrivÃ©e de centaines de nouveaux Ã©tudiants, le campus de
   Montpellier Business School sâ€™est enrichi dâ€™autant de nouvelles idÃ©es.
   Pour les concrÃ©tiser, les associations sont les vecteurs privilÃ©giÃ©s
   des Ã©tudiants pour apprendre, par la pratique, la gestion de projet, le
   management et lâ€™esprit dâ€™Ã©quipe.

   En cette rentrÃ©e, 16 associations accueillent les Ã©tudiants, couvrant
   un large spectre de centres dâ€™intÃ©rÃªt : allant du sport Ã  lâ€™e-sport, en
   passant par lâ€™art sous toutes ses formes, sans oublier les associations
   qui sâ€™engagent pour les causes humanitaires ou Ã©cologiques.

Alterner entre deux vies

   Plus de 1 300 alternants ont Ã©galement fait leur rentrÃ©e Ã  MBS. Si le
   rythme dâ€™une semaine Ã  lâ€™Ã©cole pour trois semaines en entreprise est
   avantageux pour des missions de long terme, il renforce Ã©galement le
   networking entre les Ã©tudiants rÃ©partis dans la France entiÃ¨re.

   Â« Durant les trois semaines en dehors du campus, nous nous retrouvons
   entre alternants de MBS, que ce soit pour des projets ou juste pour ne
   pas trop couper de notre vie dâ€™Ã©tudiant. Â» explique Jules, alternant en
   derniÃ¨re annÃ©e du Programme Grande Ecole. Â« Cependant, parfois loin du
   campus, il peut sâ€™avÃ©rer compliquÃ© de sâ€™investir et dâ€™intÃ©grer la vie
   associative de lâ€™Ã©cole, dont la grande partie des Ã©vÃ©nements a lieu sur
   le campus. Câ€™est de ce besoin quâ€™est nÃ© Alterâ€™Native. Â»

Alterâ€™native facilite lâ€™intÃ©gration des alternants dans la vie associative de
lâ€™Ã©cole

   Â« ConcrÃ¨tement, le but dâ€™Alterâ€™Native est dâ€™organiser des Ã©vÃ©nements
   qui prennent en compte les contraintes de planning des alternants et
   donc de faciliter leur intÃ©gration dans la vie associative du campus.
   Sous forme dâ€™afterwork, le but est de mettre en place un rÃ©seau
   professionnel entre les Ã©tudiants et donc de dÃ©couvrir dâ€™autres
   alternants vivant dans la mÃªme ville. Â» complÃ¨te Jules, faisant partie
   de lâ€™Ã©quipe dâ€™accompagnement du nouveau bureau de lâ€™association.

   Lâ€™an dernier, plusieurs afterworks ont eu lieu Ã  Paris. Â« Nous sommes
   parvenu Ã  organiser une visite privÃ©e de lâ€™AssemblÃ©e nationale. Nos
   actions ne consistent pas quâ€™Ã  fixer un point de rendez-vous entre
   alternants mais aussi Ã  offrir une vraie expÃ©rience aux participants. Â»
   conclut Jules.

   Les recrutements pour Alterâ€™Native et les 15 autres clubs et
   associations sont ouverts jusquâ€™Ã  fin Octobre. Pour les contacter,
   retrouvez-les sur les rÃ©seaux sociaux ici.

   Amies depuis prÃ¨s de 7 ans, MaÃ«va et Ludivine se sont retrouvÃ©es toutes
   les deux Ã  Montpellier Business School en 2016 lorsquâ€™elles ont rejoint
   le Programme Grande Ecole. Aujourdâ€™hui en derniÃ¨re annÃ©e, les deux
   Ã©tudiantes dÃ©cident de sâ€™engager dans un nouveau projet alliant
   solidaritÃ©, aventure, sport et dÃ©couverte et se prÃ©parent pour la
   21^Ã¨me Ã©dition du Raid Amazones en formant le duo Â« Globâ€™Nanas Â».

Quâ€™est-ce que le Raid Amazones ?

   Â« Câ€™est un Raid aventure multisport 100% fÃ©minin qui mixe dÃ©fis
   sportifs et dÃ©couverte du pays. Il rÃ©unit prÃ¨s de 300 sportives qui
   partagent les mÃªmes valeurs : la solidaritÃ©, le partage, lâ€™Ã©cologie et
   le dÃ©passement de soi. Â» explique MaÃ©va, qui sâ€™est lancÃ©e dans la
   course Ã  pied en compÃ©tition lâ€™an dernier.

   Â« Nous avons dÃ©couvert notre passion commune pour lâ€™aventure et la
   dÃ©couverte dâ€™autres pays lors de la deuxiÃ¨me annÃ©e Ã  MBS, alors que
   nous Ã©tions en Ã©change acadÃ©mique dâ€™un an en Chine. Â» complÃ¨te
   Ludivine. Â« LÃ -bas, nous avons eu lâ€™opportunitÃ© de voyager dans les
   pays limitrophes et on a souhaitÃ© ensemble retrouver ce goÃ»t du
   challenge et le sentiment qui vous envahit lorsque vous faites un
   roadtrip. Â»

Un raid 100% solidaire : Â« il ne faut pas attendre dâ€™Ãªtre concernÃ© pour se
sentir concernÃ© Â»

   Si MaÃ«va et Ludivine partagent cette passion du sport et du voyage,
   elles souhaitaient cette fois-ci ajouter une dimension solidaire Ã  leur
   aventure. Â« Chaque Ã©quipe du raid parraine une association dans
   lâ€™objectif dâ€™accroitre leur notoriÃ©tÃ© et de contribuer Ã  la rÃ©colte de
   dons. Â» explique Ludivine.

    Â« Nous avons choisi de nous engager auprÃ¨s de Vaincre la
   mucoviscidose. Cette association rÃ©unit patients, familles, soignants
   et bÃ©nÃ©voles dans lâ€™objectif de financer la recherche, former le
   personnel soignant et aider les patients dans les frais liÃ©s Ã  cette
   maladie qui touche les systÃ¨mes respiratoire et digestif. Â» prÃ©cise
   MaÃ«va.

   Â« Surtout, sâ€™il y a un message Ã  partager, câ€™est quâ€™il ne faut pas
   attendre dâ€™Ãªtre concernÃ© pour se sentir concernÃ© et ne pas attendre
   quâ€™un proche soit touchÃ© par la maladie pour dÃ©cider de sâ€™investir dans
   une cause. Â» conclut lâ€™Ã©tudiante de derniÃ¨re annÃ©e.

Une thÃ©matique qui fait Ã©cho aux valeurs fondatrices de MBS

   Depuis le 3 Septembre, la 6^Ã¨me Ã©dition de la Start-Up week bat son
   plein sur le campus de Montpellier Business School. Ce Business Game
   par Ã©quipe met chaque semaine, et jusquâ€™au 20 septembre, les 900
   Ã©tudiants de derniÃ¨re annÃ©e du Programme Grande Ecole au dÃ©fi de la
   crÃ©ation dâ€™entreprise.

   Pour cette seconde semaine de challenge, Private Sport Shop Ã©tait Ã 
   nouveau au rendez-vous pour guider les Ã©tudiants dans le marchÃ©
   complexe du sport. Â« Une des tendances du marchÃ© est la recherche
   dâ€™autonomie chez les sportifs. Â» explique Yannick LÃ©ouffre aux
   Ã©tudiants de derniÃ¨re annÃ©e.

   Ainsi, la thÃ©matique Ã  laquelle les apprentis crÃ©ateurs dâ€™entreprise
   devaient Ãªtre particuliÃ¨rement sensibles cette semaine Ã©tait
   lâ€™inclusion : Â« Cette thÃ©matique a pour but de faire travailler les
   Ã©tudiants autour de concepts Ã  la fois innovants et respectueux de la
   diversitÃ©, deux valeurs caractÃ©ristiques de Montpellier Business
   School. Â» explique Katherine Gundolf, directrice du MBS
   Entrepreneurship Center.

Une riche diversitÃ© dans les projets entrepreneuriaux proposÃ©s par les
Ã©tudiants

   Comme Ã  lâ€™accoutumÃ©e, cinq projets se sont affrontÃ©s dans une phase
   finale de pitchs devant lâ€™intÃ©gralitÃ© des Ã©tudiants et un jury
   dâ€™experts Ã©valuant le caractÃ¨re innovant, le rÃ©alisme financier et la
   stratÃ©gie de lancement de la start-up.

   Chaque groupe a dÃ©cidÃ© dâ€™intÃ©grer lâ€™inclusion et la diversitÃ© Ã  une
   Ã©tape diffÃ©rente du processus de crÃ©ation. Pour le groupe B&Fit, gamme
   de vÃªtements de sport intelligents qui sâ€™adaptent Ã  la morphologie de
   tous, ainsi que pour Safe Finder, bracelet Ã©lectronique permettant
   dâ€™Ã©mettre une alerte en cas dâ€™agression, le choix a Ã©tÃ© dâ€™intÃ©grer
   cette notion dâ€™inclusion au plus tÃ´t du Business Model et donc de
   faciliter la pratique du sport Ã  une cible spÃ©cifique.

   Pour deux autres groupes, lâ€™idÃ©e nâ€™Ã©tait pas de crÃ©er un produit mais
   de rÃ©inventer un concept existant et en le mettant au service de la
   RSE : To Gather a choisi de surfer sur la vague du plogging (courir en
   ramassant les dÃ©chets) en organisant une sÃ©rie de courses officielles
   dont la recette serait reversÃ©e Ã  plusieurs associations. Le second
   groupe a, quant Ã  lui, imaginÃ© une agence de coachs sportifs dÃ©livrant
   leurs services aux entreprises avec comme particularitÃ© de former et
   dâ€™engager uniquement les anciens dÃ©tenus dont la rÃ©insertion sur le
   marchÃ© du travail peut sâ€™avÃ©rer difficile.

   NÃ©anmoins, un groupe est parvenu Ã  sortir son Ã©pingle du jeu grÃ¢ce Ã  un
   besoin trÃ¨s bien identifiÃ© : Smart Swim. Â« Nous sommes partis dâ€™une
   simple vidÃ©o, oÃ¹ nous avons constatÃ© quâ€™en compÃ©tition officielle, on
   tapait sur la tÃªte des nageurs malvoyants pour quâ€™ils puissent savoir
   quand se retourner Ã  lâ€™extrÃ©mitÃ© du bassin. Â» explique alors le
   pitcheur. Smart Swim est un Ã©quipement semblable Ã  des lunettes de
   natation, avec la particularitÃ© dâ€™Ã©mettre une vibration lorsque le
   nageur sâ€™apprÃªte Ã  changer de couloir ou Ã  heurter lâ€™extrÃ©mitÃ© du
   bassin. Â« Ce produit nâ€™est donc pas uniquement pour les nageurs en
   situation de cÃ©citÃ©. Cela peut correspondre Ã  tous les nageurs qui
   prÃ©fÃ¨rent se concentrer sur leur performance, plutÃ´t que sur leur bonne
   trajectoire. Le sport pour tous. Â»

   A chaque rentrÃ©e scolaire, curiositÃ©, inconnu et nouveaux projets se
   bousculent dans la tÃªte de tous les Ã©tudiants, mais la peur de lâ€™Ã©chec
   peut constituer un obstacle Ã  la prise dâ€™initiative. Ce mardi 10
   septembre constituait donc le jour idÃ©al pour lever ces freins
   potentiels et accueillir dans les locaux de Montpellier Business School
   Philippe CROIZON, ancien ouvrier devenu aventurier et athlÃ¨te aprÃ¨s la
   perte de tous ses membres, venu partager son histoire avec les
   Ã©tudiants de premiÃ¨re annÃ©e du Programme Grande Ecole.

Lâ€™entourage, lâ€™humour et le sport : les trois outils de rÃ©silience de
Philippe CROIZON

   Â« Lorsque vous subissez une crise, une rupture ou un accident, vous
   traversez les fameuses cinq phases de rÃ©silience. Dâ€™abord lâ€™abnÃ©gation,
   on refuse ce qui nous arrive. Puis la nÃ©gociation avec soi-mÃªme, la
   dÃ©pression, la colÃ¨re et enfin lâ€™acceptation. Les phases nâ€™ont pas
   dâ€™ordre prÃ©dÃ©fini et surtout pas de durÃ©e prÃ©dÃ©finie Â» explique
   Philippe CROIZON aprÃ¨s avoir expliquÃ© les circonstances de son
   accident.

   Pour accÃ©lÃ©rer cette rÃ©silience, M. CROIZON sâ€™est appuyÃ© sur trois
   piliers : lâ€™entourage qui lui a offert son autonomie, le sport, qui
   offre un environnement favorable au dÃ©passement de soi, et lâ€™humour,
   qui a ponctuÃ© lâ€™intÃ©gralitÃ© de la confÃ©rence et qui permet Ã©galement de
   dÃ©dramatiser la situation.

Â« Lâ€™impossible nâ€™existe pas Â»

   Le sport a Ã©tÃ© le fil conducteur du parcours de vie de Philippe
   CROIZON. Â« Mon premier dÃ©fi a Ã©tÃ© de pouvoir remarcher pour les
   cinquante ans de mariage de mes grands-parents. Lors de mon admission
   au centre de rÃ©Ã©ducation, on mâ€™a dit Â« Pour toi, rien nâ€™est interdit,
   il faut tenter sa chance Â». Â» Une fois ce premier pari gagnÃ©, les
   autres dÃ©fis se sont enchaÃ®nÃ©s : le saut en parachute avec son fils, la
   participation au Paris-Dakar, puis la cÃ©lÃ¨bre traversÃ©e de la Manche Ã 
   la nage et le dÃ©fi de relier les cinq continents Ã  la nage.

   Â« Il faut oser. Lâ€™impossible nâ€™existe pas. Ce sont uniquement des
   inhibiteurs que lâ€™on se fixe tout seul. Jâ€™ai tendance Ã  suivre une idÃ©e
   et Ã  avoir peur quâ€™aprÃ¨s avoir reÃ§u toutes les informations. Câ€™est
   pourquoi il faut se fixer et sâ€™engager pour ses objectifs avant que le
   doute survienne. Â»

Communiquer et travailler en Ã©quipe : le don de soi est tout aussi important
que le dÃ©passement de soi

   Lors de sa prÃ©paration de la traversÃ©e de la Manche Ã  la nage, Philippe
   CROIZON sâ€™est entourÃ© dâ€™un coach sportif, de mÃ©decins et de sa
   compagne, Suzana Sabino. Â« Lâ€™essentiel lorsque lâ€™on monte une Ã©quipe,
   câ€™est la communication. Le silence est un vÃ©ritable poison. Les aidants
   sont tout aussi importants que ceux qui rÃ©alisent le dÃ©fi le jour J. Le
   don de soi pour lâ€™autre est tout aussi important que le dÃ©passement de
   soi. Câ€™est pourquoi Ã  la fin dâ€™un dÃ©fi, ce nâ€™est jamais un Â« jâ€™ai
   rÃ©ussi Â» mais un Â« on a rÃ©ussi Â». Â»

   La confÃ©rence sâ€™est achevÃ©e sous lâ€™admiration et les applaudissements
   des quelques 500 Ã©tudiants du Programme Grande Ecole, prÃªts Ã  relever
   de nouveaux dÃ©fis et Ã  vaincre lâ€™impossible.

   La Start-Up Week est de retour sur le campus de Montpellier Business
   School pour une 6^Ã¨me Ã©dition. Ce Business Game par Ã©quipe met chaque
   semaine, et jusquâ€™au 20 septembre, les 900 Ã©tudiants de derniÃ¨re annÃ©e
   du Programme Grande Ecole au dÃ©fi de la crÃ©ation dâ€™entreprise.

   EncadrÃ©s par une dizaine de coachs experts, les 127 Ã©quipes rÃ©inventent
   cette annÃ©e les entreprises du secteur sportif. Petite nouveautÃ© de
   cette Ã©dition, la thÃ©matique du sport est dÃ©clinÃ©e en 3 sous-segments
   du marchÃ© afin de renouveler le challenge et les concepts toutes les
   semaines. Pour ce premier round, les apprentis entrepreneurs ont
   concentrÃ© leurs compÃ©tences et leur crÃ©ativitÃ© autour du sport
   Â« outdoor Â» (en extÃ©rieur).

Private Sport Shop ouvre le bal des confÃ©rences-experts et partage les
tendances du marchÃ©

   Yannick LÃ©ouffre, CEO de PRIVATE SPORT SHOP, leader des ventes privÃ©es
   dâ€™Ã©quipement sportif et partenaire de lâ€™Ã©dition, a acceptÃ© dâ€™inaugurer
   cette semaine sportive avec une confÃ©rence dâ€™ouverture dÃ©livrant les
   principales problÃ©matiques et opportunitÃ©s du marchÃ© sportif. Â« Le
   spectre du marchÃ© sportif est trÃ¨s large Â» explique Vanessa Motais,
   ChargÃ©e de Mission au sein du MBS Entrepreneurship Center. Â« Cela peut
   aller du secteur de lâ€™Ã©quipement, aux droits de diffusion, en passant
   par les innovations dans les disciplines elles-mÃªmes. Â»

    Â« On dÃ©nombre cinq grosses tendances du marchÃ©. Les sportifs
   recherchent davantage dâ€™autonomie et souhaitent pratiquer sans club ou
   licence. Lâ€™angle du bien-Ãªtre a le vent en poupe, et câ€™est la pratique
   du sport en extÃ©rieur, Â« outdoor Â», qui complÃ¨te le podium des besoins
   des clients. Â» explique Yannick LÃ©ouffre aux Ã©tudiants de derniÃ¨re
   annÃ©e.

Une simulation aboutie rÃ©sultant sur des concepts Ã©ligibles au sein de
lâ€™incubateur de lâ€™Entrepreneurship Center

   Aux termes de cette semaine intensive de challenge, les Ã©tudiants se
   sont prÃªtÃ©s au jeu du pitch devant un jury de professionnels. Â« Outre
   lâ€™innovation et le concept, chaque groupe se devait de prÃ©senter un
   rÃ©alisme financier et une stratÃ©gie de lancement indispensable dans le
   cadre dâ€™une simulation de collecte de fonds Â» explique CÃ©drine Joly,
   Directrice du Programme Grand Ecole.

   Les cinq meilleurs projets se sont affrontÃ©s dans une phase finale de
   pitchs devant lâ€™intÃ©gralitÃ© de leurs camarades et un jury dâ€™experts. Si
   certains Ã©tudiants ont surfÃ© sur le boom des applications de
   rencontres, les VTT Ã©lectriques ou les systÃ¨mes fonctionnant sur
   lâ€™Ã©conomie collaborative comme BlablaCar, la premiÃ¨re place sâ€™est jouÃ©e
   entre Altibuzz, un altimÃ¨tre vibrant pour indiquer Ã  lâ€™utilisateur
   quand dÃ©clencher son parachute, et Lensup, une solution de rÃ©alitÃ©
   virtuelle permettant de transformer son environnement rÃ©el en jeux
   vidÃ©o. AprÃ¨s un lÃ©ger suspens, câ€™est finalement le second groupe, Ã  la
   cible plus large et misant sur les rÃ©ussites du marchÃ© du jeu vidÃ©o
   comme PokÃ©mon Go, qui remporte cette premiÃ¨re semaine de challenge.

   Â« Les projets prÃ©sentÃ©s cette semaine Ã©taient de trÃ¨s bonne qualitÃ© et
   peuvent Ãªtre incubÃ©s au sein de lâ€™Entrepreneurship Center pour les
   Ã©tudiants qui le souhaitent. Lâ€™occasion de rappeler que lâ€™incubateur de
   MBS est ouvert Ã  tous : Ã©tudiants, diplÃ´mÃ©s, enseignants,
   professionnels de la rÃ©gionâ€¦ Â» conclut Katherine Gundolf, Directrice de
   lâ€™Entrepreneurship Center.

   Lâ€™EFMD (European Foundation for Management Development) vient
   dâ€™attribuer son accrÃ©ditation EQUIS (European Quality Improvement
   System) Ã  Montpellier Business School (MBS). DÃ©jÃ  accrÃ©ditÃ©e AACSB et
   AMBA, lâ€™Ã‰cole rejoint le cercle trÃ¨s restreint des 1% de Business
   Schools mondiales dÃ©tentrices de la Â« triple couronne Â».

   MBS devient ainsi la 14Ã¨me Ã©cole de management franÃ§aise post-classe
   prÃ©paratoire triple accrÃ©ditÃ©e AACSB/AMBA/EQUIS, la 91^Ã¨me sur environ
   14 000 business schools dans le monde.

   Lâ€™obtention de cette accrÃ©ditation est le rÃ©sultat dâ€™un long et
   rigoureux processus dâ€™examen, qui permet dâ€™Ã©valuer la conformitÃ© dâ€™un
   Ã©tablissement Ã  des standards acadÃ©miques Ã©levÃ©s, dÃ©finis par lâ€™EFMD et
   portant sur toutes les dimensions et composantes de lâ€™institution :
   stratÃ©gie, pÃ©dagogie, recherche, internationalisation, proximitÃ© avec
   les entreprises et rÃ©seaux de diplÃ´mÃ©s. Elle sâ€™applique Ã  tous les
   programmes de lâ€™Ã©cole : Bachelor (BAC+3), Programme Grande Ecole (BAC
   +5), Masters of Science (BAC+5), Executive MBA.

   MBS sâ€™appuie sur un positionnement atypique, alliant exigence
   acadÃ©mique et empreinte RSE, qui lui a permis de se diffÃ©rencier et
   dâ€™acquÃ©rir, au fil des annÃ©es, une place Ã  part parmi les Business
   Schools franÃ§aises et internationales. Comme le prÃ©cise Bruno DUCASSE,
   Directeur GÃ©nÃ©ral de Montpellier Business School : Â« Cette nouvelle
   accrÃ©ditation est une reconnaissance de la stratÃ©gie de MBS, qui allie
   une exigence de qualitÃ© acadÃ©mique rÃ©pondant aux plus hauts standards
   mondiaux Ã  la dÃ©fense de valeurs fortes : lâ€™ouverture sociale et la
   construction dâ€™une Ã©conomie et dâ€™une sociÃ©tÃ© plus responsables. Ce
   nâ€™est quâ€™un dÃ©but, lâ€™entrÃ©e dans un nouveau processus dâ€™amÃ©lioration
   continue qui doit nous amener Ã  poursuivre notre progression. Â»

   Pour AndrÃ© Deljarry, prÃ©sident de Montpellier Business School, Â« cette
   nouvelle accrÃ©ditation place MBS dans le top 1% des business schools
   dans le monde. Câ€™est une grande fiertÃ© pour notre Ã©cole et pour notre
   territoire. Avec la triple couronne et demain un nouveau campus, MBS
   sera prÃªte Ã  entrer dans une nouvelle phase de son dÃ©veloppement. Â»

Lâ€™intÃ©gration des enjeux Ã©cologiques et sociÃ©taux est au cÅ“ur de la stratÃ©gie
de MBS depuis de nombreuses annÃ©es.

   Montpellier Business School sâ€™associe Ã  la ConfÃ©rence des Grandes
   Ecoles et endosse la tribune du RÃ©seau FranÃ§ais Etudiant pour le
   DÃ©veloppement Durable (REFEDD) qui appelle Ã  une meilleure intÃ©gration
   des enjeux climatiques et sociaux dans la stratÃ©gie des Ã©tablissements
   dâ€™enseignement supÃ©rieur.

   Montpellier Business School (MBS) soutient cette initiative collective,
   qui est en pleine adÃ©quation avec les fondements de lâ€™Ã©cole, sa
   mission et ses valeurs : former des managers responsables, capables
   dâ€™incarner lâ€™Ã©thique, lâ€™ouverture, la diversitÃ©, la responsabilitÃ© et
   la performance globale.

   Connue pour son engagement sociÃ©tal en faveur de la DiversitÃ©, MBS a
   intÃ©grÃ© toutes les dimensions de la RSE dans son fonctionnement interne
   comme dans ses enseignements depuis plusieurs annÃ©es, dans lâ€™objectif
   dâ€™Å“uvrer Ã  son Ã©chelle et Ã  travers ses Ã©tudiants et diplÃ´mÃ©s Ã  une
   sociÃ©tÃ© plus durable.



Lâ€™enseignement et la sensibilisation 360Â° aux enjeux environnementaux et
sociÃ©taux

   MBS intÃ¨gre la RSE et le dÃ©veloppement durable tant dans ses
   enseignements, oÃ¹ ces matiÃ¨res sont enseignÃ©es en transverse ainsi que
   par des cours dÃ©diÃ©s dans tous ses programmes (du Bachelor Ã 
   lâ€™exÃ©cutive MBA), que dans son fonctionnement interne.

   Les Ã©tudiants suivent ainsi des cours de RSE et DÃ©veloppement Durable,
   de Marketing Responsable, et choisissent par exemple une spÃ©cialisation
   Ã‰conomie sociale et solidaire ou de Management durable des ressources
   humaines et de la diversitÃ©.

   Tous les ans, lâ€™ensemble des Ã©tudiants de premiÃ¨re annÃ©e des programmes
   Bachelor et Grande Ecole participent aux projets solidaires Alpha et
   PromÃ©thÃ©e. CoachÃ© par un collaborateur de MBS, chaque groupe sâ€™engage Ã 
   mettre en place un plan dâ€™actions pour collecter des fonds, amÃ©liorer
   la notoriÃ©tÃ© et renforcer lâ€™impact dâ€™une association.

   Lâ€™ensemble des collaborateurs et des Ã©tudiants sont Ã©galement invitÃ©s Ã 
   participer Ã  de nombreux dispositifs sensibilisant aux valeurs
   sociÃ©tales tout au long de lâ€™annÃ©e. En 2019, la Semaine de la
   ResponsabilitÃ© Globale a organisÃ© des ateliers et confÃ©rences de
   sensibilisation Ã  la disparition de la faune et a ainsi ouvert sur de
   nouveaux dispositifs Ã©conomiques pour fonder son entreprise sans mettre
   en danger son Ã©cosystÃ¨me.

Sâ€™engager pour lâ€™avenir en soutenant la recherche durable

   A MBS plusieurs chaires et groupes de recherche interdisciplinaires
   travaillent sur les champs de la RSE.

   La Chaire Ã©nergie et dÃ©veloppement durable qui organise la confÃ©rence
   annuelle â€œInternational Conference on Energy, Finance and Macroeconomy
   (ICEFM)â€, rÃ©unit des chercheurs et acteurs du monde entier autour des
   derniÃ¨res dÃ©couvertes de ces trois domaines.

   La Chaire Entrepreneuriat Social & Inclusion a pour objectif de
   promouvoir les entreprises de lâ€™Ã©conomie sociale et solidaire et Ã 
   soutenir les personnes Ã©loignÃ©es de lâ€™emploi afin de contribuer Ã  une
   Ã©conomie plus inclusive.

   La Chaire en microfinance se consacre Ã©galement Ã  lâ€™inclusion via la
   microfinance, en particulier dans les pays dÃ©veloppÃ©s, sensibilise les
   Ã©tudiants au Social Business et collabore avec le Professeur Muhammad
   Yunus, Prix Nobel de la Paix en 2006.

   Le groupe Â« Valeurs, Organisations, Acteurs et ResponsabilitÃ© Â» (VOAR)
   est spÃ©cialisÃ© dans les pratiques de RSE et accompagne les entreprises
   dans la mise en place de politique de dÃ©veloppement durable depuis
   plusieurs annÃ©es, comme a pu le faire le Dr. Magalie Marais au sein de
   lâ€™AssemblÃ©e nationale il y a dÃ©jÃ  deux ans.

   Enfin, le DÃ©veloppement Durable sera au cÅ“ur du cahier des charges du
   futur campus Ã©coresponsable, au bilan carbone nÃ©gatif pour un
   enseignement supÃ©rieur Ã  la hauteur des enjeux Ã©cologiques.

   Vendredi 20 septembre dernier, câ€™est devant un jury de professionnels
   que se sont affrontÃ©s les cinq derniers finalistes de la 6^Ã¨me Ã©dition
   de la Start-Up Week. Ce Business Game

   Pour cette ultime phase, lâ€™expertise de Private Sport Shop, parrain de
   lâ€™Ã©dition, a Ã©tÃ© dâ€™autant plus importante quâ€™elle ciblait un Ã©lÃ©ment
   clÃ© de leur positionnement : le sport et le digital.

Application, rÃ©alitÃ© virtuelle et algorithme : un podium sous le signe de
lâ€™innovation technologique

   Pour cette ultime semaine de Business Game, le concept reste inchangÃ© :
   cinq projets sâ€™affrontent dans une phase finale de pitchs devant
   lâ€™intÃ©gralitÃ© des Ã©tudiants et un jury dâ€™experts Ã©valuant le caractÃ¨re
   innovant, le rÃ©alisme financier et la stratÃ©gie de lancement de la
   start-up.

   Au pied du podium, on retrouve le groupe Virtual Arena qui ont choisi
   de se concentrer sur lâ€™aspect convivial et spectaculaire des grands
   Ã©vÃ©nements sportifs. Aux vues de lâ€™amÃ©lioration perpÃ©tuelle des
   retransmissions de ces manifestations, ce groupe a imaginÃ© un concept
   de Â« loge virtuelle Â» permettant dâ€™assister avec des lunettes de
   rÃ©alitÃ©s virtuelles aux compÃ©titions sportives comme si vous y Ã©tiez,
   et de se rÃ©unir en salon virtuel avec les personnes de votre choix.

   En second position, le groupe SAM (Sport Automatic Manager) a dÃ©cidÃ© de
   surfer sur la croissance du nombre dâ€™adhÃ©sions dans les salles de sport
   mais surtout sur le nombre dâ€™abandons au bout de quelques semaines. La
   raison la plus souvent citÃ©e ? Un manque de disponibilitÃ© des
   professionnels et de suivi. Ainsi, le groupe a construit un coach
   virtuel, Â« Sam Â», qui permet de suivre de maniÃ¨re autonome ses progrÃ¨s
   grÃ¢ce Ã  un algorithme.

   Cependant, le groupe qui est parvenu Ã  se hisser Ã  la premiÃ¨re marche
   du podium est Place Me, une application de mise en vente de billets
   dâ€™Ã©vÃ©nements sportifs, entre particuliers et en last minute. Le projet
   est nÃ© du dÃ©ficit du taux de remplissage des stades : 70% des siÃ¨ges
   sont effectivement occupÃ©s lorsque 100% des places ont pourtant Ã©tÃ©
   vendues. Lâ€™application permet alors de mettre en relation les
   passionnÃ©s, de digitaliser son billet et de le revendre en direct sur
   lâ€™application quelques minutes avant le match. Un concept innovant Ã 
   mi-chemin entre une plateforme e-commerce et un rÃ©seau social.

Les 16 associations et clubs Ã©tudiants de MBS recrutent leurs nouveaux
membres

   Avec lâ€™arrivÃ©e de centaines de nouveaux Ã©tudiants, le campus de
   Montpellier Business School sâ€™est enrichi dâ€™autant de nouvelles idÃ©es.
   Pour les concrÃ©tiser, les associations sont les vecteurs privilÃ©giÃ©s
   des Ã©tudiants pour apprendre, par la pratique, la gestion de projet, le
   management et lâ€™esprit dâ€™Ã©quipe.

   En cette rentrÃ©e, 16 associations accueillent les Ã©tudiants, couvrant
   un large spectre de centres dâ€™intÃ©rÃªt : allant du sport Ã  lâ€™e-sport, en
   passant par lâ€™art sous toutes ses formes, sans oublier les associations
   qui sâ€™engagent pour les causes humanitaires ou Ã©cologiques.

Alterner entre deux vies

   Plus de 1 300 alternants ont Ã©galement fait leur rentrÃ©e Ã  MBS. Si le
   rythme dâ€™une semaine Ã  lâ€™Ã©cole pour trois semaines en entreprise est
   avantageux pour des missions de long terme, il renforce Ã©galement le
   networking entre les Ã©tudiants rÃ©partis dans la France entiÃ¨re.

   Â« Durant les trois semaines en dehors du campus, nous nous retrouvons
   entre alternants de MBS, que ce soit pour des projets ou juste pour ne
   pas trop couper de notre vie dâ€™Ã©tudiant. Â» explique Jules, alternant en
   derniÃ¨re annÃ©e du Programme Grande Ecole. Â« Cependant, parfois loin du
   campus, il peut sâ€™avÃ©rer compliquÃ© de sâ€™investir et dâ€™intÃ©grer la vie
   associative de lâ€™Ã©cole, dont la grande partie des Ã©vÃ©nements a lieu sur
   le campus. Câ€™est de ce besoin quâ€™est nÃ© Alterâ€™Native. Â»

Alterâ€™native facilite lâ€™intÃ©gration des alternants dans la vie associative de
lâ€™Ã©cole

   Â« ConcrÃ¨tement, le but dâ€™Alterâ€™Native est dâ€™organiser des Ã©vÃ©nements
   qui prennent en compte les contraintes de planning des alternants et
   donc de faciliter leur intÃ©gration dans la vie associative du campus.
   Sous forme dâ€™afterwork, le but est de mettre en place un rÃ©seau
   professionnel entre les Ã©tudiants et donc de dÃ©couvrir dâ€™autres
   alternants vivant dans la mÃªme ville. Â» complÃ¨te Jules, faisant partie
   de lâ€™Ã©quipe dâ€™accompagnement du nouveau bureau de lâ€™association.

   Lâ€™an dernier, plusieurs afterworks ont eu lieu Ã  Paris. Â« Nous sommes
   parvenu Ã  organiser une visite privÃ©e de lâ€™AssemblÃ©e nationale. Nos
   actions ne consistent pas quâ€™Ã  fixer un point de rendez-vous entre
   alternants mais aussi Ã  offrir une vraie expÃ©rience aux participants. Â»
   conclut Jules.

   Les recrutements pour Alterâ€™Native et les 15 autres clubs et
   associations sont ouverts jusquâ€™Ã  fin Octobre. Pour les contacter,

   Amies depuis prÃ¨s de 7 ans, MaÃ«va et Ludivine se sont retrouvÃ©es toutes
   les deux Ã  Montpellier Business School en 2016 lorsquâ€™elles ont rejoint
   le Programme Grande Ecole. Aujourdâ€™hui en derniÃ¨re annÃ©e, les deux
   Ã©tudiantes dÃ©cident de sâ€™engager dans un nouveau projet alliant
   solidaritÃ©, aventure, sport et dÃ©couverte et se prÃ©parent pour la
   21^Ã¨me Ã©dition du Raid Amazones en formant le duo Â« Globâ€™Nanas Â».

Quâ€™est-ce que le Raid Amazones ?

   Â« Câ€™est un Raid aventure multisport 100% fÃ©minin qui mixe dÃ©fis
   sportifs et dÃ©couverte du pays. Il rÃ©unit prÃ¨s de 300 sportives qui
   partagent les mÃªmes valeurs : la solidaritÃ©, le partage, lâ€™Ã©cologie et
   le dÃ©passement de soi. Â» explique MaÃ©va, qui sâ€™est lancÃ©e dans la
   course Ã  pied en compÃ©tition lâ€™an dernier.

   Â« Nous avons dÃ©couvert notre passion commune pour lâ€™aventure et la
   dÃ©couverte dâ€™autres pays lors de la deuxiÃ¨me annÃ©e Ã  MBS, alors que
   nous Ã©tions en Ã©change acadÃ©mique dâ€™un an en Chine. Â» complÃ¨te
   Ludivine. Â« LÃ -bas, nous avons eu lâ€™opportunitÃ© de voyager dans les
   pays limitrophes et on a souhaitÃ© ensemble retrouver ce goÃ»t du
   challenge et le sentiment qui vous envahit lorsque vous faites un
   roadtrip. Â»

Un raid 100% solidaire : Â« il ne faut pas attendre dâ€™Ãªtre concernÃ© pour se
sentir concernÃ© Â»

   Si MaÃ«va et Ludivine partagent cette passion du sport et du voyage,
   elles souhaitaient cette fois-ci ajouter une dimension solidaire Ã  leur
   aventure. Â« Chaque Ã©quipe du raid parraine une association dans
   lâ€™objectif dâ€™accroitre leur notoriÃ©tÃ© et de contribuer Ã  la rÃ©colte de
   dons. Â» explique Ludivine.

    Â« Nous avons choisi de nous engager auprÃ¨s de Vaincre la
   mucoviscidose. Cette association rÃ©unit patients, familles, soignants
   et bÃ©nÃ©voles dans lâ€™objectif de financer la recherche, former le
   personnel soignant et aider les patients dans les frais liÃ©s Ã  cette
   maladie qui touche les systÃ¨mes respiratoire et digestif. Â» prÃ©cise
   MaÃ«va.

   Â« Surtout, sâ€™il y a un message Ã  partager, câ€™est quâ€™il ne faut pas
   attendre dâ€™Ãªtre concernÃ© pour se sentir concernÃ© et ne pas attendre
   quâ€™un proche soit touchÃ© par la maladie pour dÃ©cider de sâ€™investir dans
   une cause. Â» conclut lâ€™Ã©tudiante de derniÃ¨re annÃ©e.

Une thÃ©matique qui fait Ã©cho aux valeurs fondatrices de MBS

   Depuis le 3 Septembre, la 6^Ã¨me Ã©dition de la Start-Up week bat son
   plein sur le campus de Montpellier Business School. Ce Business Game
   par Ã©quipe met chaque semaine, et jusquâ€™au 20 septembre, les 900
   Ã©tudiants de derniÃ¨re annÃ©e du Programme Grande Ecole au dÃ©fi de la
   crÃ©ation dâ€™entreprise.

   Pour cette seconde semaine de challenge, Private Sport Shop Ã©tait Ã 
   nouveau au rendez-vous pour guider les Ã©tudiants dans le marchÃ©
   complexe du sport. Â« Une des tendances du marchÃ© est la recherche
   dâ€™autonomie chez les sportifs. Â» explique Yannick LÃ©ouffre aux
   Ã©tudiants de derniÃ¨re annÃ©e.

   Ainsi, la thÃ©matique Ã  laquelle les apprentis crÃ©ateurs dâ€™entreprise
   devaient Ãªtre particuliÃ¨rement sensibles cette semaine Ã©tait
   lâ€™inclusion : Â« Cette thÃ©matique a pour but de faire travailler les
   Ã©tudiants autour de concepts Ã  la fois innovants et respectueux de la
   diversitÃ©, deux valeurs caractÃ©ristiques de Montpellier Business
   School. Â» explique Katherine Gundolf, directrice du MBS
   Entrepreneurship Center.

Une riche diversitÃ© dans les projets entrepreneuriaux proposÃ©s par les
Ã©tudiants

   Comme Ã  lâ€™accoutumÃ©e, cinq projets se sont affrontÃ©s dans une phase
   finale de pitchs devant lâ€™intÃ©gralitÃ© des Ã©tudiants et un jury
   dâ€™experts Ã©valuant le caractÃ¨re innovant, le rÃ©alisme financier et la
   stratÃ©gie de lancement de la start-up.

   Chaque groupe a dÃ©cidÃ© dâ€™intÃ©grer lâ€™inclusion et la diversitÃ© Ã  une
   Ã©tape diffÃ©rente du processus de crÃ©ation. Pour le groupe B&Fit, gamme
   de vÃªtements de sport intelligents qui sâ€™adaptent Ã  la morphologie de
   tous, ainsi que pour Safe Finder, bracelet Ã©lectronique permettant
   dâ€™Ã©mettre une alerte en cas dâ€™agression, le choix a Ã©tÃ© dâ€™intÃ©grer
   cette notion dâ€™inclusion au plus tÃ´t du Business Model et donc de
   faciliter la pratique du sport Ã  une cible spÃ©cifique.

   Pour deux autres groupes, lâ€™idÃ©e nâ€™Ã©tait pas de crÃ©er un produit mais
   de rÃ©inventer un concept existant et en le mettant au service de la
   RSE : To Gather a choisi de surfer sur la vague du plogging (courir en
   ramassant les dÃ©chets) en organisant une sÃ©rie de courses officielles
   dont la recette serait reversÃ©e Ã  plusieurs associations. Le second
   groupe a, quant Ã  lui, imaginÃ© une agence de coachs sportifs dÃ©livrant
   leurs services aux entreprises avec comme particularitÃ© de former et
   dâ€™engager uniquement les anciens dÃ©tenus dont la rÃ©insertion sur le
   marchÃ© du travail peut sâ€™avÃ©rer difficile.

   NÃ©anmoins, un groupe est parvenu Ã  sortir son Ã©pingle du jeu grÃ¢ce Ã  un
   besoin trÃ¨s bien identifiÃ© : Smart Swim. Â« Nous sommes partis dâ€™une
   simple vidÃ©o, oÃ¹ nous avons constatÃ© quâ€™en compÃ©tition officielle, on
   tapait sur la tÃªte des nageurs malvoyants pour quâ€™ils puissent savoir
   quand se retourner Ã  lâ€™extrÃ©mitÃ© du bassin. Â» explique alors le
   pitcheur. Smart Swim est un Ã©quipement semblable Ã  des lunettes de
   natation, avec la particularitÃ© dâ€™Ã©mettre une vibration lorsque le
   nageur sâ€™apprÃªte Ã  changer de couloir ou Ã  heurter lâ€™extrÃ©mitÃ© du
   bassin. Â« Ce produit nâ€™est donc pas uniquement pour les nageurs en
   situation de cÃ©citÃ©. Cela peut correspondre Ã  tous les nageurs qui
   prÃ©fÃ¨rent se concentrer sur leur performance, plutÃ´t que sur leur bonne
   trajectoire. Le sport pour tous. Â»

   A chaque rentrÃ©e scolaire, curiositÃ©, inconnu et nouveaux projets se
   bousculent dans la tÃªte de tous les Ã©tudiants, mais la peur de lâ€™Ã©chec
   peut constituer un obstacle Ã  la prise dâ€™initiative. Ce mardi 10
   septembre constituait donc le jour idÃ©al pour lever ces freins
   potentiels et accueillir dans les locaux de Montpellier Business School
   Philippe CROIZON, ancien ouvrier devenu aventurier et athlÃ¨te aprÃ¨s la
   perte de tous ses membres, venu partager son histoire avec les
   Ã©tudiants de premiÃ¨re annÃ©e du Programme Grande Ecole.

Lâ€™entourage, lâ€™humour et le sport : les trois outils de rÃ©silience de
Philippe CROIZON

   Â« Lorsque vous subissez une crise, une rupture ou un accident, vous
   traversez les fameuses cinq phases de rÃ©silience. Dâ€™abord lâ€™abnÃ©gation,
   on refuse ce qui nous arrive. Puis la nÃ©gociation avec soi-mÃªme, la
   dÃ©pression, la colÃ¨re et enfin lâ€™acceptation. Les phases nâ€™ont pas
   dâ€™ordre prÃ©dÃ©fini et surtout pas de durÃ©e prÃ©dÃ©finie Â» explique
   Philippe CROIZON aprÃ¨s avoir expliquÃ© les circonstances de son
   accident.

   Pour accÃ©lÃ©rer cette rÃ©silience, M. CROIZON sâ€™est appuyÃ© sur trois
   piliers : lâ€™entourage qui lui a offert son autonomie, le sport, qui
   offre un environnement favorable au dÃ©passement de soi, et lâ€™humour,
   qui a ponctuÃ© lâ€™intÃ©gralitÃ© de la confÃ©rence et qui permet Ã©galement de
   dÃ©dramatiser la situation.

Â« Lâ€™impossible nâ€™existe pas Â»

   Le sport a Ã©tÃ© le fil conducteur du parcours de vie de Philippe
   CROIZON. Â« Mon premier dÃ©fi a Ã©tÃ© de pouvoir remarcher pour les
   cinquante ans de mariage de mes grands-parents. Lors de mon admission
   au centre de rÃ©Ã©ducation, on mâ€™a dit Â« Pour toi, rien nâ€™est interdit,
   il faut tenter sa chance Â». Â» Une fois ce premier pari gagnÃ©, les
   autres dÃ©fis se sont enchaÃ®nÃ©s : le saut en parachute avec son fils, la
   participation au Paris-Dakar, puis la cÃ©lÃ¨bre traversÃ©e de la Manche Ã 
   la nage et le dÃ©fi de relier les cinq continents Ã  la nage.

   Â« Il faut oser. Lâ€™impossible nâ€™existe pas. Ce sont uniquement des
   inhibiteurs que lâ€™on se fixe tout seul. Jâ€™ai tendance Ã  suivre une idÃ©e
   et Ã  avoir peur quâ€™aprÃ¨s avoir reÃ§u toutes les informations. Câ€™est
   pourquoi il faut se fixer et sâ€™engager pour ses objectifs avant que le
   doute survienne. Â»

Communiquer et travailler en Ã©quipe : le don de soi est tout aussi important
que le dÃ©passement de soi

   Lors de sa prÃ©paration de la traversÃ©e de la Manche Ã  la nage, Philippe
   CROIZON sâ€™est entourÃ© dâ€™un coach sportif, de mÃ©decins et de sa
   compagne, Suzana Sabino. Â« Lâ€™essentiel lorsque lâ€™on monte une Ã©quipe,
   câ€™est la communication. Le silence est un vÃ©ritable poison. Les aidants
   sont tout aussi importants que ceux qui rÃ©alisent le dÃ©fi le jour J. Le
   don de soi pour lâ€™autre est tout aussi important que le dÃ©passement de
   soi. Câ€™est pourquoi Ã  la fin dâ€™un dÃ©fi, ce nâ€™est jamais un Â« jâ€™ai
   rÃ©ussi Â» mais un Â« on a rÃ©ussi Â». Â»

   La confÃ©rence sâ€™est achevÃ©e sous lâ€™admiration et les applaudissements
   des quelques 500 Ã©tudiants du Programme Grande Ecole, prÃªts Ã  relever
   de nouveaux dÃ©fis et Ã  vaincre lâ€™impossible.

   La Start-Up Week est de retour sur le campus de Montpellier Business
   School pour une 6^Ã¨me Ã©dition. Ce Business Game par Ã©quipe met chaque
   semaine, et jusquâ€™au 20 septembre, les 900 Ã©tudiants de derniÃ¨re annÃ©e
   du Programme Grande Ecole au dÃ©fi de la crÃ©ation dâ€™entreprise.

   EncadrÃ©s par une dizaine de coachs experts, les 127 Ã©quipes rÃ©inventent
   cette annÃ©e les entreprises du secteur sportif. Petite nouveautÃ© de
   cette Ã©dition, la thÃ©matique du sport est dÃ©clinÃ©e en 3 sous-segments
   du marchÃ© afin de renouveler le challenge et les concepts toutes les
   semaines. Pour ce premier round, les apprentis entrepreneurs ont
   concentrÃ© leurs compÃ©tences et leur crÃ©ativitÃ© autour du sport
   Â« outdoor Â» (en extÃ©rieur).

Private Sport Shop ouvre le bal des confÃ©rences-experts et partage les
tendances du marchÃ©

   Yannick LÃ©ouffre, CEO de PRIVATE SPORT SHOP, leader des ventes privÃ©es
   dâ€™Ã©quipement sportif et partenaire de lâ€™Ã©dition, a acceptÃ© dâ€™inaugurer
   cette semaine sportive avec une confÃ©rence dâ€™ouverture dÃ©livrant les
   principales problÃ©matiques et opportunitÃ©s du marchÃ© sportif. Â« Le
   spectre du marchÃ© sportif est trÃ¨s large Â» explique Vanessa Motais,
   ChargÃ©e de Mission au sein du MBS Entrepreneurship Center. Â« Cela peut
   aller du secteur de lâ€™Ã©quipement, aux droits de diffusion, en passant
   par les innovations dans les disciplines elles-mÃªmes. Â»

    Â« On dÃ©nombre cinq grosses tendances du marchÃ©. Les sportifs
   recherchent davantage dâ€™autonomie et souhaitent pratiquer sans club ou
   licence. Lâ€™angle du bien-Ãªtre a le vent en poupe, et câ€™est la pratique
   du sport en extÃ©rieur, Â« outdoor Â», qui complÃ¨te le podium des besoins
   des clients. Â» explique Yannick LÃ©ouffre aux Ã©tudiants de derniÃ¨re
   annÃ©e.

Une simulation aboutie rÃ©sultant sur des concepts Ã©ligibles au sein de
lâ€™incubateur de lâ€™Entrepreneurship Center

   Aux termes de cette semaine intensive de challenge, les Ã©tudiants se
   sont prÃªtÃ©s au jeu du pitch devant un jury de professionnels. Â« Outre
   lâ€™innovation et le concept, chaque groupe se devait de prÃ©senter un
   rÃ©alisme financier et une stratÃ©gie de lancement indispensable dans le
   cadre dâ€™une simulation de collecte de fonds Â» explique CÃ©drine Joly,
   Directrice du Programme Grand Ecole.

   Les cinq meilleurs projets se sont affrontÃ©s dans une phase finale de
   pitchs devant lâ€™intÃ©gralitÃ© de leurs camarades et un jury dâ€™experts. Si
   certains Ã©tudiants ont surfÃ© sur le boom des applications de
   rencontres, les VTT Ã©lectriques ou les systÃ¨mes fonctionnant sur
   lâ€™Ã©conomie collaborative comme BlablaCar, la premiÃ¨re place sâ€™est jouÃ©e
   entre Altibuzz, un altimÃ¨tre vibrant pour indiquer Ã  lâ€™utilisateur
   quand dÃ©clencher son parachute, et Lensup, une solution de rÃ©alitÃ©
   virtuelle permettant de transformer son environnement rÃ©el en jeux
   vidÃ©o. AprÃ¨s un lÃ©ger suspens, câ€™est finalement le second groupe, Ã  la
   cible plus large et misant sur les rÃ©ussites du marchÃ© du jeu vidÃ©o
   comme PokÃ©mon Go, qui remporte cette premiÃ¨re semaine de challenge.

   Â« Les projets prÃ©sentÃ©s cette semaine Ã©taient de trÃ¨s bonne qualitÃ© et
   peuvent Ãªtre incubÃ©s au sein de lâ€™Entrepreneurship Center pour les
   Ã©tudiants qui le souhaitent. Lâ€™occasion de rappeler que lâ€™incubateur de
   MBS est ouvert Ã  tous : Ã©tudiants, diplÃ´mÃ©s, enseignants,
   professionnels de la rÃ©gionâ€¦ Â» conclut Katherine Gundolf, Directrice de
   lâ€™Entrepreneurship Center.

lâ€™Entrepreneurship Center ? Voici une session de rattrapage en infographie :
