The SeaMonkey^Â® Project

   The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey
   Internet Application Suite (see below). Such a software suite was
   previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey
   project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates to this
   concept. Containing an Internet browser, email & newsgroup client with
   an included web feed reader, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development
   tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers
   and corporate users.

   Under the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same Mozilla Firefox source
   code which powers such products as Thunderbird. Legal backing is
   provided by the SeaMonkey Association (SeaMonkey e.V.).

   SeaMonkey and the future

   Wow! A new release and two news items together. What is cooking?

   With the SeaMonkey 2.49.5 release the 2.49.x line comes to an end.
   Unless a catastrophic bug is discovered 2.49.5 will be the last ESR 52
   based version. Backporting security fixes and at the same time working
   on the next, already overdue, major release is not possible with the
   few remaining developers.

   Plans are to do further interim 2.53 versions based on a much enhanced
   Gecko 56 base while working on bringing you the next ESR 60 based 2.57
   version. After 2.57 we will decide about the future. The current
   Mozilla Gecko codebase has seen a flow of constant major changes and
   api removals in the last 2 years and is no longer really usable for our
   needs. By the end of the year the SeaMonkey project is expected to be
   completely independent of Mozilla. We will see how this pans out but we
   are doing our best and already have a new infrastructure in place where
   we do builds and website hosting.

   We would also like to remind everyone again that this a community
   project independent of Mozilla. So if you want to continue seeing
   future SeaMonkey releases please help by either donating money or even
   better help out with development. We are still committed and hope you
   are too.

   SeaMonkey 2.49.5 released

   The SeaMonkey project is proud to present SeaMonkey 2.49.5: The new
   release of the all-in-one Internet suite is available for download now!
   Based on Mozilla Firefox 52.9 ESR and further enhanced, it delivers
   those same developments in web technologies such as HTML5, hardware
   acceleration and improved JavaScript speed.

   SeaMonkey 2.49.5 is available in 20 languages, for Windows, MacOS x64
   and Linux.

   Automatic upgrades from previous versions are, for most configurations,
   disabled for this release. If you need to upgrade from an earlier
   version, please download the full installer from the downloads section
   and install SeaMonkey 2.49.5 manually over the previous version.

   This release adds officially supported Windows x64 and Linux x64
   versions. If you want to install the Windows x64 version please
   download the full installer and uninstall the old x86 release first.
   Your profile data will be kept during an uninstall. Support for the
   macOS x86 unified binary is dropped because of using a more current
   macOS development environment.

   For a more complete list of major changes in SeaMonkey 2.49.5, see the
   What's New in SeaMonkey 2.49.5 section of the Release Notes, which also
   contain a list of known issues and answers to frequently asked

   Help squashing bugs in mail and news

   Our Thunderbird friends ask for help squashing bugs. If you have some
   spare time help them and also us because SeaMonkey and Thunderbird use
   a shared codebase for mail and news.

   Some Details from the announcement:

   We are grateful to have a very active set of users who generate a lot
   of bug reports and we are requesting your help in sorting them, an
   activity called bug triage. Weâ€™re holding â€œBug Daysâ€ on (all day, EU
   and US timezones) and (EU and US timezones until 4pm EDT). During these
   bug days we will log on and work as a community to triage as many bugs
   as possible. With several of us working at the same time we can help
   each other in real time â€“ answering questions, sharing ideas ideas, and
   enjoying being with like-minded people.

   No coding or special skills are required, and you donâ€™t need to be an
   expert or long term user of Thunderbird. Some things youâ€™ll be doing if
   you participate:
     * Help other users by checking their bug reports to see if you can
       reproduce the behavior of their reported problem.
     * Get advice about your own bug report(s).
     * Learn the basics about Thunderbird troubleshooting and how to
       contribute.

   But we hope youâ€™ll join us on the 8th or the 13th via #tb-qa on
   Mozillaâ€™s IRC so that we can put these bugs in their place which helps
   make Thunderbird even better. If you have any questions feel free to
   email Ryan.

   Visit the Thunderbird Blog to see the full announcement.

   Download problems with NoScript active

   If you are using NoScript you might encounter a certificate error when
   trying to download SeaMonkey from this site. NoScript tries to force an
   https connection for an http only site. It is not a NoScript problem
   but how the Mozilla server, from which downloads are delivered, is
   configured.

   In this case please add download.cdn.mozilla.net to the NoScript "Never
   force secure (HTTPS) connections" options or turn off NoScript for this
   download only. The settings are located in the NoScript options under
   "Advanced->HTTPS".

The SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite

   SeaMonkey has inherited the successful all-in-one concept of the
   original Netscape Communicator and continues that product line based on
   the modern, cross-platform architecture provided by the Mozilla
   project.
     * The Internet browser at the core of the SeaMonkey Internet
       Application Suite uses the same rendering engine and application
       platform as Mozilla Firefox, with popular features like tabbed
       browsing, feed detection, popup blocking, smart location bar, find
       as you type and a lot of other functionality for a smooth web
       experience.
     * SeaMonkey's Mail and Newsgroups client shares lots of code with
       Thunderbird and features adaptive Junk mail filtering, tags and
       mail views, web feeds reading, tabbed messaging, multiple accounts,
       S/MIME, address books with LDAP support and is ready for both
       private and corporate use.
     * Additional components include an easy-to-use HTML Editor, the
       ChatZilla IRC chat application and web development tools like a DOM
       Inspector.
     * If that's still not enough, SeaMonkey can be extended with numerous
       Add-Ons that provide additional functionality and customization for
       a complete Internet experience.

   Download problems with NoScript active

   If you are using NoScript you might encounter a certificate error when
   trying to download SeaMonkey from this site. NoScript tries to force an
   https connection for an http only site. It is not a NoScript problem
   but how the Mozilla server, from which downloads are delivered, is
   configured.

   In this case please add download.cdn.mozilla.net to the NoScript "Never
   force secure (HTTPS) connections" options or turn off NoScript for this

The SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite

   SeaMonkey has inherited the successful all-in-one concept of the
   original Netscape Communicator and continues that product line based on
   the modern, cross-platform architecture provided by the Mozilla
   project.
     * The Internet browser at the core of the SeaMonkey Internet
       Application Suite uses the same rendering engine and application
       platform as Mozilla Firefox, with popular features like tabbed
       browsing, feed detection, popup blocking, smart location bar, find
       as you type and a lot of other functionality for a smooth web
       experience.
     * SeaMonkey's Mail and Newsgroups client shares lots of code with
       Thunderbird and features adaptive Junk mail filtering, tags and
       mail views, web feeds reading, tabbed messaging, multiple accounts,
       S/MIME, address books with LDAP support and is ready for both
       private and corporate use.
     * Additional components include an easy-to-use HTML Editor, the
       ChatZilla IRC chat application and web development tools like a DOM
       Inspector.
     * If that's still not enough, SeaMonkey can be extended with numerous
       Add-Ons that provide additional functionality and customization for
       a complete Internet experience.

The SeaMonkey^Â® Project

   The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey
   Internet Application Suite (see below). Such a software suite was
   previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey
   project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates to this
   concept. Containing an Internet browser, email & newsgroup client with
   an included web feed reader, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development
   tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers
   and corporate users.

   Under the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same Mozilla Firefox source
   code which powers such products as Thunderbird. Legal backing is
   provided by the SeaMonkey Association (SeaMonkey e.V.).

   SeaMonkey and the future

   Wow! A new release and two news items together. What is cooking?

   With the SeaMonkey 2.49.5 release the 2.49.x line comes to an end.
   Unless a catastrophic bug is discovered 2.49.5 will be the last ESR 52
   based version. Backporting security fixes and at the same time working
   on the next, already overdue, major release is not possible with the
   few remaining developers.

   Plans are to do further interim 2.53 versions based on a much enhanced
   Gecko 56 base while working on bringing you the next ESR 60 based 2.57
   version. After 2.57 we will decide about the future. The current
   Mozilla Gecko codebase has seen a flow of constant major changes and
   api removals in the last 2 years and is no longer really usable for our
   needs. By the end of the year the SeaMonkey project is expected to be
   completely independent of Mozilla. We will see how this pans out but we
   are doing our best and already have a new infrastructure in place where
   we do builds and website hosting.

   We would also like to remind everyone again that this a community
   project independent of Mozilla. So if you want to continue seeing
   future SeaMonkey releases please help by either donating money or even
   better help out with development. We are still committed and hope you
   are too.

   This release adds officially supported Windows x64 and Linux x64
   versions. If you want to install the Windows x64 version please
   download the full installer and uninstall the old x86 release first.
   Your profile data will be kept during an uninstall. Support for the
   macOS x86 unified binary is dropped because of using a more current
   macOS development environment.

   Help squashing bugs in mail and news

   Our Thunderbird friends ask for help squashing bugs. If you have some
   spare time help them and also us because SeaMonkey and Thunderbird use
   a shared codebase for mail and news.

   Some Details from the announcement:

   We are grateful to have a very active set of users who generate a lot
   of bug reports and we are requesting your help in sorting them, an
   activity called bug triage. Weâ€™re holding â€œBug Daysâ€ on (all day, EU
   and US timezones) and (EU and US timezones until 4pm EDT). During these
   bug days we will log on and work as a community to triage as many bugs
   as possible. With several of us working at the same time we can help
   each other in real time â€“ answering questions, sharing ideas ideas, and
   enjoying being with like-minded people.

   No coding or special skills are required, and you donâ€™t need to be an
   expert or long term user of Thunderbird. Some things youâ€™ll be doing if
   you participate:
     * Help other users by checking their bug reports to see if you can
       reproduce the behavior of their reported problem.
     * Get advice about your own bug report(s).
     * Learn the basics about Thunderbird troubleshooting and how to
       contribute.

   But we hope youâ€™ll join us on the 8th or the 13th via #tb-qa on
   Mozillaâ€™s IRC so that we can put these bugs in their place which helps
   make Thunderbird even better. If you have any questions feel free to
   email Ryan.

   Visit the Thunderbird Blog to see the full announcement.

The SeaMonkey^Â® Project

   The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey
   Internet Application Suite (see below). Such a software suite was
   previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey
   project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates to this
   concept. Containing an Internet browser, email & newsgroup client with
   an included web feed reader, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development
   tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers
   and corporate users.

   Under the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same Mozilla Firefox source
   code which powers such products as Thunderbird. Legal backing is
   provided by the SeaMonkey Association (SeaMonkey e.V.).

   SeaMonkey and the future

   Wow! A new release and two news items together. What is cooking?

   With the SeaMonkey 2.49.5 release the 2.49.x line comes to an end.
   Unless a catastrophic bug is discovered 2.49.5 will be the last ESR 52
   based version. Backporting security fixes and at the same time working
   on the next, already overdue, major release is not possible with the
   few remaining developers.

   Plans are to do further interim 2.53 versions based on a much enhanced
   Gecko 56 base while working on bringing you the next ESR 60 based 2.57
   version. After 2.57 we will decide about the future. The current
   Mozilla Gecko codebase has seen a flow of constant major changes and
   api removals in the last 2 years and is no longer really usable for our
   needs. By the end of the year the SeaMonkey project is expected to be
   completely independent of Mozilla. We will see how this pans out but we
   are doing our best and already have a new infrastructure in place where
   we do builds and website hosting.

   We would also like to remind everyone again that this a community
   project independent of Mozilla. So if you want to continue seeing
   future SeaMonkey releases please help by either donating money or even
   better help out with development. We are still committed and hope you
   are too.

   SeaMonkey 2.49.5 released

   The SeaMonkey project is proud to present SeaMonkey 2.49.5: The new
   release of the all-in-one Internet suite is available for download now!

   and Linux.

   Automatic upgrades from previous versions are, for most configurations,

   This release adds officially supported Windows x64 and Linux x64
   versions. If you want to install the Windows x64 version please
   download the full installer and uninstall the old x86 release first.
   Your profile data will be kept during an uninstall. Support for the
   macOS x86 unified binary is dropped because of using a more current
   macOS development environment.

   For a more complete list of major changes in SeaMonkey 2.49.5, see the
   What's New in SeaMonkey 2.49.5 section of the Release Notes, which also

   Help squashing bugs in mail and news

   Our Thunderbird friends ask for help squashing bugs. If you have some
   spare time help them and also us because SeaMonkey and Thunderbird use
   a shared codebase for mail and news.

   Some Details from the announcement:

   We are grateful to have a very active set of users who generate a lot
   of bug reports and we are requesting your help in sorting them, an
   activity called bug triage. Weâ€™re holding â€œBug Daysâ€ on (all day, EU
   and US timezones) and (EU and US timezones until 4pm EDT). During these
   bug days we will log on and work as a community to triage as many bugs
   as possible. With several of us working at the same time we can help
   each other in real time â€“ answering questions, sharing ideas ideas, and
   enjoying being with like-minded people.

   No coding or special skills are required, and you donâ€™t need to be an
   expert or long term user of Thunderbird. Some things youâ€™ll be doing if
   you participate:
     * Help other users by checking their bug reports to see if you can
       reproduce the behavior of their reported problem.
     * Get advice about your own bug report(s).
     * Learn the basics about Thunderbird troubleshooting and how to
       contribute.

   But we hope youâ€™ll join us on the 8th or the 13th via #tb-qa on
   Mozillaâ€™s IRC so that we can put these bugs in their place which helps
   make Thunderbird even better. If you have any questions feel free to
   email Ryan.

   Visit the Thunderbird Blog to see the full announcement.

   Download problems with NoScript active

   If you are using NoScript you might encounter a certificate error when
   trying to download SeaMonkey from this site. NoScript tries to force an
   https connection for an http only site. It is not a NoScript problem
   but how the Mozilla server, from which downloads are delivered, is
   configured.

   In this case please add download.cdn.mozilla.net to the NoScript "Never
   force secure (HTTPS) connections" options or turn off NoScript for this
   download only. The settings are located in the NoScript options under

The SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite

   SeaMonkey has inherited the successful all-in-one concept of the
   original Netscape Communicator and continues that product line based on
   the modern, cross-platform architecture provided by the Mozilla
   project.
     * The Internet browser at the core of the SeaMonkey Internet
       Application Suite uses the same rendering engine and application
       platform as Mozilla Firefox, with popular features like tabbed
       browsing, feed detection, popup blocking, smart location bar, find
       as you type and a lot of other functionality for a smooth web
       experience.
     * SeaMonkey's Mail and Newsgroups client shares lots of code with
       Thunderbird and features adaptive Junk mail filtering, tags and
       mail views, web feeds reading, tabbed messaging, multiple accounts,
       S/MIME, address books with LDAP support and is ready for both
       private and corporate use.
     * Additional components include an easy-to-use HTML Editor, the
       ChatZilla IRC chat application and web development tools like a DOM
       Inspector.
     * If that's still not enough, SeaMonkey can be extended with numerous
       Add-Ons that provide additional functionality and customization for
       a complete Internet experience.

   Download problems with NoScript active

   If you are using NoScript you might encounter a certificate error when
   trying to download SeaMonkey from this site. NoScript tries to force an
   https connection for an http only site. It is not a NoScript problem
   but how the Mozilla server, from which downloads are delivered, is
   configured.

   In this case please add download.cdn.mozilla.net to the NoScript "Never
   force secure (HTTPS) connections" options or turn off NoScript for this
   download only. The settings are located in the NoScript options under
   "Advanced->HTTPS".

The SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite

   SeaMonkey has inherited the successful all-in-one concept of the
   original Netscape Communicator and continues that product line based on
   the modern, cross-platform architecture provided by the Mozilla
   project.
     * The Internet browser at the core of the SeaMonkey Internet
       Application Suite uses the same rendering engine and application
       platform as Mozilla Firefox, with popular features like tabbed
       browsing, feed detection, popup blocking, smart location bar, find
       as you type and a lot of other functionality for a smooth web
       experience.
     * SeaMonkey's Mail and Newsgroups client shares lots of code with
       Thunderbird and features adaptive Junk mail filtering, tags and
       mail views, web feeds reading, tabbed messaging, multiple accounts,
       S/MIME, address books with LDAP support and is ready for both
       private and corporate use.
     * Additional components include an easy-to-use HTML Editor, the
       ChatZilla IRC chat application and web development tools like a DOM
       Inspector.
     * If that's still not enough, SeaMonkey can be extended with numerous
       Add-Ons that provide additional functionality and customization for
       a complete Internet experience.

The SeaMonkey^Â® Project

   The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey
   Internet Application Suite (see below). Such a software suite was
   previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey
   project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates to this
   concept. Containing an Internet browser, email & newsgroup client with
   an included web feed reader, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development
   tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers
   and corporate users.

   Under the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same Mozilla Firefox source

   SeaMonkey and the future

   Wow! A new release and two news items together. What is cooking?

   With the SeaMonkey 2.49.5 release the 2.49.x line comes to an end.
   Unless a catastrophic bug is discovered 2.49.5 will be the last ESR 52
   based version. Backporting security fixes and at the same time working
   on the next, already overdue, major release is not possible with the
   few remaining developers.

   Plans are to do further interim 2.53 versions based on a much enhanced
   Gecko 56 base while working on bringing you the next ESR 60 based 2.57
   version. After 2.57 we will decide about the future. The current
   Mozilla Gecko codebase has seen a flow of constant major changes and
   api removals in the last 2 years and is no longer really usable for our
   needs. By the end of the year the SeaMonkey project is expected to be
   completely independent of Mozilla. We will see how this pans out but we
   are doing our best and already have a new infrastructure in place where
   we do builds and website hosting.

   We would also like to remind everyone again that this a community
   project independent of Mozilla. So if you want to continue seeing
   future SeaMonkey releases please help by either donating money or even
   better help out with development. We are still committed and hope you
   are too.

   and Linux.

   Automatic upgrades from previous versions are, for most configurations,

   This release adds officially supported Windows x64 and Linux x64
   versions. If you want to install the Windows x64 version please
   download the full installer and uninstall the old x86 release first.
   Your profile data will be kept during an uninstall. Support for the
   macOS x86 unified binary is dropped because of using a more current
   macOS development environment.

   Help squashing bugs in mail and news

   Our Thunderbird friends ask for help squashing bugs. If you have some
   spare time help them and also us because SeaMonkey and Thunderbird use
   a shared codebase for mail and news.

   Some Details from the announcement:

   We are grateful to have a very active set of users who generate a lot
   of bug reports and we are requesting your help in sorting them, an
   activity called bug triage. Weâ€™re holding â€œBug Daysâ€ on (all day, EU
   and US timezones) and (EU and US timezones until 4pm EDT). During these
   bug days we will log on and work as a community to triage as many bugs
   as possible. With several of us working at the same time we can help
   each other in real time â€“ answering questions, sharing ideas ideas, and
   enjoying being with like-minded people.

   No coding or special skills are required, and you donâ€™t need to be an
   expert or long term user of Thunderbird. Some things youâ€™ll be doing if
   you participate:
     * Help other users by checking their bug reports to see if you can
       reproduce the behavior of their reported problem.
     * Get advice about your own bug report(s).
     * Learn the basics about Thunderbird troubleshooting and how to
       contribute.

   But we hope youâ€™ll join us on the 8th or the 13th via #tb-qa on
   Mozillaâ€™s IRC so that we can put these bugs in their place which helps
   make Thunderbird even better. If you have any questions feel free to
   email Ryan.

   Visit the Thunderbird Blog to see the full announcement.

   With the SeaMonkey 2.49.5 release the 2.49.x line comes to an end.
   Unless a catastrophic bug is discovered 2.49.5 will be the last ESR 52
   based version. Backporting security fixes and at the same time working
   on the next, already overdue, major release is not possible with the
   few remaining developers.

   Plans are to do further interim 2.53 versions based on a much enhanced
   Gecko 56 base while working on bringing you the next ESR 60 based 2.57
   version. After 2.57 we will decide about the future. The current
   Mozilla Gecko codebase has seen a flow of constant major changes and
   api removals in the last 2 years and is no longer really usable for our
   needs. By the end of the year the SeaMonkey project is expected to be
   completely independent of Mozilla. We will see how this pans out but we
   are doing our best and already have a new infrastructure in place where
   we do builds and website hosting.

   We would also like to remind everyone again that this a community
   project independent of Mozilla. So if you want to continue seeing
   future SeaMonkey releases please help by either donating money or even
   better help out with development. We are still committed and hope you
   are too.

   Help squashing bugs in mail and news

   Our Thunderbird friends ask for help squashing bugs. If you have some
   spare time help them and also us because SeaMonkey and Thunderbird use
   a shared codebase for mail and news.

   Some Details from the announcement:

   We are grateful to have a very active set of users who generate a lot
   of bug reports and we are requesting your help in sorting them, an
   activity called bug triage. Weâ€™re holding â€œBug Daysâ€ on (all day, EU
   and US timezones) and (EU and US timezones until 4pm EDT). During these
   bug days we will log on and work as a community to triage as many bugs
   as possible. With several of us working at the same time we can help
   each other in real time â€“ answering questions, sharing ideas ideas, and
   enjoying being with like-minded people.

   No coding or special skills are required, and you donâ€™t need to be an
   expert or long term user of Thunderbird. Some things youâ€™ll be doing if
   you participate:
     * Help other users by checking their bug reports to see if you can
       reproduce the behavior of their reported problem.
     * Get advice about your own bug report(s).
     * Learn the basics about Thunderbird troubleshooting and how to
       contribute.

   But we hope youâ€™ll join us on the 8th or the 13th via #tb-qa on
   Mozillaâ€™s IRC so that we can put these bugs in their place which helps
   make Thunderbird even better. If you have any questions feel free to
   email Ryan.

   Visit the Thunderbird Blog to see the full announcement.

The SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite

   SeaMonkey has inherited the successful all-in-one concept of the
   original Netscape Communicator and continues that product line based on
   the modern, cross-platform architecture provided by the Mozilla
   project.
     * The Internet browser at the core of the SeaMonkey Internet
       Application Suite uses the same rendering engine and application
       platform as Mozilla Firefox, with popular features like tabbed
       browsing, feed detection, popup blocking, smart location bar, find
       as you type and a lot of other functionality for a smooth web
       experience.
     * SeaMonkey's Mail and Newsgroups client shares lots of code with
       Thunderbird and features adaptive Junk mail filtering, tags and
       mail views, web feeds reading, tabbed messaging, multiple accounts,
       S/MIME, address books with LDAP support and is ready for both
       private and corporate use.
     * Additional components include an easy-to-use HTML Editor, the
       ChatZilla IRC chat application and web development tools like a DOM
       Inspector.
     * If that's still not enough, SeaMonkey can be extended with numerous
       Add-Ons that provide additional functionality and customization for
       a complete Internet experience.

The SeaMonkey^Â® Project

   The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey
   Internet Application Suite (see below). Such a software suite was
   previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey
   project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates to this
   concept. Containing an Internet browser, email & newsgroup client with
   an included web feed reader, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development
   tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers
   and corporate users.

   Under the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same Mozilla Firefox source
   code which powers such products as Thunderbird. Legal backing is
   provided by the SeaMonkey Association (SeaMonkey e.V.).

The SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite

   SeaMonkey has inherited the successful all-in-one concept of the
   original Netscape Communicator and continues that product line based on
   the modern, cross-platform architecture provided by the Mozilla
   project.
     * The Internet browser at the core of the SeaMonkey Internet
       Application Suite uses the same rendering engine and application
       platform as Mozilla Firefox, with popular features like tabbed
       browsing, feed detection, popup blocking, smart location bar, find
       as you type and a lot of other functionality for a smooth web
       experience.
     * SeaMonkey's Mail and Newsgroups client shares lots of code with
       Thunderbird and features adaptive Junk mail filtering, tags and
       mail views, web feeds reading, tabbed messaging, multiple accounts,
       S/MIME, address books with LDAP support and is ready for both
       private and corporate use.
     * Additional components include an easy-to-use HTML Editor, the
       ChatZilla IRC chat application and web development tools like a DOM
       Inspector.
     * If that's still not enough, SeaMonkey can be extended with numerous
       Add-Ons that provide additional functionality and customization for
       a complete Internet experience.

The SeaMonkey^Â® Project

   The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey
   Internet Application Suite (see below). Such a software suite was
   previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey
   project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates to this
   concept. Containing an Internet browser, email & newsgroup client with
   an included web feed reader, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development
   tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers
   and corporate users.

   Under the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same Mozilla Firefox source
   code which powers such products as Thunderbird. Legal backing is
   provided by the SeaMonkey Association (SeaMonkey e.V.).

   SeaMonkey is proudly sponsored by dotcom-monitor, loadview,
   WebHostingBuddy.com, Web Hosting Professor and Driven Coffee Roasters.

   SeaMonkey and the future

   Wow! A new release and two news items together. What is cooking?

   With the SeaMonkey 2.49.5 release the 2.49.x line comes to an end.
   Unless a catastrophic bug is discovered 2.49.5 will be the last ESR 52
   based version. Backporting security fixes and at the same time working
   on the next, already overdue, major release is not possible with the
   few remaining developers.

   Plans are to do further interim 2.53 versions based on a much enhanced
   Gecko 56 base while working on bringing you the next ESR 60 based 2.57
   version. After 2.57 we will decide about the future. The current
   Mozilla Gecko codebase has seen a flow of constant major changes and
   api removals in the last 2 years and is no longer really usable for our
   needs. By the end of the year the SeaMonkey project is expected to be
   completely independent of Mozilla. We will see how this pans out but we
   are doing our best and already have a new infrastructure in place where
   we do builds and website hosting.

   We would also like to remind everyone again that this a community
   project independent of Mozilla. So if you want to continue seeing
   future SeaMonkey releases please help by either donating money or even
   better help out with development. We are still committed and hope you
   are too.

   SeaMonkey 2.49.5 released

   The SeaMonkey project is proud to present SeaMonkey 2.49.5: The new
   release of the all-in-one Internet suite is available for download now!
   Based on Mozilla Firefox 52.9 ESR and further enhanced, it delivers
   those same developments in web technologies such as HTML5, hardware
   acceleration and improved JavaScript speed.

   SeaMonkey 2.49.5 is available in 20 languages, for Windows, MacOS x64
   and Linux.

   Automatic upgrades from previous versions are, for most configurations,
   disabled for this release. If you need to upgrade from an earlier
   version, please download the full installer from the downloads section
   and install SeaMonkey 2.49.5 manually over the previous version.

   This release adds officially supported Windows x64 and Linux x64
   versions. If you want to install the Windows x64 version please
   download the full installer and uninstall the old x86 release first.
   Your profile data will be kept during an uninstall. Support for the
   macOS x86 unified binary is dropped because of using a more current
   macOS development environment.

   For a more complete list of major changes in SeaMonkey 2.49.5, see the
   What's New in SeaMonkey 2.49.5 section of the Release Notes, which also

   Help squashing bugs in mail and news

   Our Thunderbird friends ask for help squashing bugs. If you have some
   spare time help them and also us because SeaMonkey and Thunderbird use
   a shared codebase for mail and news.

   Some Details from the announcement:

   We are grateful to have a very active set of users who generate a lot
   of bug reports and we are requesting your help in sorting them, an
   activity called bug triage. Weâ€™re holding â€œBug Daysâ€ on (all day, EU
   and US timezones) and (EU and US timezones until 4pm EDT). During these
   bug days we will log on and work as a community to triage as many bugs
   as possible. With several of us working at the same time we can help
   each other in real time â€“ answering questions, sharing ideas ideas, and
   enjoying being with like-minded people.

   No coding or special skills are required, and you donâ€™t need to be an
   expert or long term user of Thunderbird. Some things youâ€™ll be doing if
   you participate:
     * Help other users by checking their bug reports to see if you can
       reproduce the behavior of their reported problem.
     * Get advice about your own bug report(s).
     * Learn the basics about Thunderbird troubleshooting and how to
       contribute.

   But we hope youâ€™ll join us on the 8th or the 13th via #tb-qa on
   Mozillaâ€™s IRC so that we can put these bugs in their place which helps
   make Thunderbird even better. If you have any questions feel free to
   email Ryan.

   Visit the Thunderbird Blog to see the full announcement.

   Today is "I love Free Software Day"

   Download problems with NoScript active

   If you are using NoScript you might encounter a certificate error when
   trying to download SeaMonkey from this site. NoScript tries to force an
   https connection for an http only site. It is not a NoScript problem
   but how the Mozilla server, from which downloads are delivered, is
   configured.

   In this case please add download.cdn.mozilla.net to the NoScript "Never
   force secure (HTTPS) connections" options or turn off NoScript for this
   download only. The settings are located in the NoScript options under
   "Advanced->HTTPS".
