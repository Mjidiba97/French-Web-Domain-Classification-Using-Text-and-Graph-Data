   Use Multiple Selections to rename variables quickly Here Ctrl+DâŒ˜+D is
   used to select the next occurrence of the current word. Once created,
   each selection allows for full-featured editing.
   Quickly jump to files and functions with Goto Anything Here Ctrl+PâŒ˜+P
   is used to open the Goto Anything menu, xcc is used to select the file
   xla_compilation_cache.cc, @ switches to symbol mode, and :c selects the
   XlaCompilationCache::Compile method.
   Navigate source using Goto Definition Here the mouse is hovered over a
   symbol to jump to the definition. The keyboard shortcut F12 can be used
   when the caret is located on a symbol, or Goto Symbol in Project can be
   opened via Ctrl+Shift+Râ‡§+âŒ˜+R to jump to the definition of any symbol in
   the project.
   Unsurpassed performance Here a 7MB source code file is opened, and Goto
   Symbol Ctrl+RâŒ˜+R is used to jump to a function 200k lines down. Full
   editing features are retained for code in large files, or with complex
   syntax.

Some features our users love:

Goto Anything

   Use Goto Anything to open files with only a few keystrokes, and
   instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.

   Triggered with Ctrl+PâŒ˜+P, it is possible to:
     * Type part of a file name to open it.
     * Type @ to jump to symbols, # to search within the file, and : to go
       to a line number.

   These shortcuts can be combined, so tp@rf may take you to a function
   read_file within a file text_parser.py. Similarly, tp:100 would take
   you to line 100 of the same file.

Goto Definition

   Using information from syntax definitions, Sublime Text automatically
   generates a project-wide index of every class, method and function.
   This index powers Goto Definition, which is exposed in three different
   ways:
     * A popup is displayed when hovering over a symbol
     * Pressing F12 when the caret is on a symbol
     * The Goto Symbol in Project functionality

   Symbol indexing can be customized on a per-syntax basis via
   configuration files, allowing users to tailor the feature to their
   needs.

Multiple Selections

   Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple
   selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename
   variables with ease, and manipulate files faster than ever.

   Try pressing Ctrl+Shift+Lâ‡§+âŒ˜+L to split the selection into lines and
   Ctrl+DâŒ˜+D to select the next occurrence of the selected word. To make
   multiple selections with the mouse, take a look at the Column Selection
   documentation.

Command Palette

   The Command Palette holds infrequently used functionality, like
   sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation settings.
   With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you want, without
   ever having to navigate through the menus or remember obscure key
   bindings.

   Show the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+Pâ‡§+âŒ˜+P.

Powerful API and Package Ecosystem

   Sublime Text has a powerful, Python API that allows plugins to augment
   built-in functionality.

   Package Control can be installed via the command palette, providing
   simple access to thousands of packages built by the community.

Customize Anything

   Key bindings, menus, snippets, macros, completions and more - just
   about everything in Sublime Text is customizable with simple JSON
   files. This system gives you flexibility as settings can be specified
   on a per-file type and per-project basis.

Split Editing

   Get the most out of your wide screen monitor with split editing
   support. Edit files side by side, or edit two locations in the one
   file. You can edit with as many rows and columns as you wish. Take
   advantage of multiple monitors by editing with multiple windows, and
   using multiple splits in each window.

   Take a look at the View â–¶ Layout menu for split editing options. To
   open multiple views into the one file, use the File â–¶ New View into
   File menu item.

Instant Project Switch

   Projects in Sublime Text capture the full contents of the workspace,
   including modified and unsaved files. You can switch between projects
   in a manner similar to Goto Anything, and the switch is instant, with
   no save prompts - all your modifications will be restored next time the
   project is opened.

Performance

   Sublime Text is built from custom components, providing for unmatched
   responsiveness. From a powerful, custom cross-platform UI toolkit, to
   an unmatched syntax highlighting engine, Sublime Text sets the bar for
   performance.

Cross Platform

   Sublime Text is available for Mac, Windows and Linux. One license is
   all you need to use Sublime Text on every computer you own, no matter
   what operating system it uses.

   Sublime Text uses a custom UI toolkit, optimized for speed and beauty,
   while taking advantage of native functionality on each platform.

   https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/use-mmap-with-care Tue, 2 May
   2019 01:00:00 +0000 Benjamin Schaaf <p>When we implemented the git
   portion of <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>, we
   chose to use <code>mmap</code> for reading git object files. This
   turned out to be considerably more difficult than we had first thought.
   Using <code>mmap</code> in desktop applications has some serious
   caveats, and here's why:</p> <p><i>You can follow along with <a
   href="https://github.com/sublimehq/mmap-example" target="_blank">the
   example project here.</a></i></p> <p>Say you were reading some binary
   format, data you need throughout some application. You take the easiest
   approach and use a simple <code>read</code> to get the full contents of
   the file. You release your software and someone comes along and says:
   "I need to parse this 3GB file, but I only have 2GB of memory. Could
   you make it so that you're not using so much memory?". Of course you
   want to help them, so you do some searching and come to the conclusion
   that memory mapping is the perfect solution to this problem.</p>
   <p>Memory mapped files work by mapping the full file into a virtual
   address space and then using page faults to determine which chunks to
   load into physical memory. In essence it allows you to access the file
   as if you had read the whole thing into memory, without actually doing
   so. Crucially it requires only a small change to the codebase:</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/1.png"> <p>And with that, you've
   fixed the memory usage issue. You've fixed the bug, people are happy
   and all is well until you get another support ticket. Your program is
   crashing with a SIGBUS.</p> <h2>Caveat 1: SIGBUS</h2> <p>SIGBUS (bus
   error) is a signal that happens when you try to access memory that has
   not been physically mapped. This is different to a SIGSEGV
   (segmentation fault) in that a segfault happens when an address is
   invalid, while a bus error means the address is valid but we failed to
   read/write.</p> <p>As it turns out, the ticket comes from someone using
   a networked drive. Their network happened to disconnect while your
   memory mapped file was open, and since the file no longer existed the
   OS couldn't load it into ram for you and gave you a SIGBUS instead.</p>
   <p>Because the OS is loading the file on demand, you now have this
   wonderful issue where any arbitrary read from an address into the
   memory mapped file can and <em>will</em> fail at some point.</p>
   <p>Luckily on POSIX systems we have signal handlers, and SIGBUS is a
   signal we can handle. All you need to do is register a signal handler
   for SIGBUS when the program starts and jump back to our code to handle
   failures there.</p> <img src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/2.png">
   <p>Sadly our code actually has some edge cases we should consider:</p>
   <p>Signal handlers are global, but signals themselves are per-thread.
   So you need to make sure you're not messing with any other threads by
   making all our data thread local. Let's also add some robustness by
   making sure we've called <code>setjmp</code> before
   <code>longjmp</code>.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/3.png"> <p>Using
   <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>ing from a signal handler
   is actually unsafe. It seems to cause undefined behaviour, especially
   on MacOS. Instead we must use <code>sigsetjmp</code> and
   <code>siglongjmp</code>. Since we're jumping out of a signal handler,
   we need that signal handler to not block any future signals, so we must
   also pass <code>SA_NODEFER</code> to <code>sigaction</code>.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/4.png"> <p>This is starting to get
   quite complicated, especially if you were to have multiple places where
   a SIGBUS could happen. Let's factor things out into functions to make
   the logic a little cleaner.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/5.png"> <p>There, now you just
   need to remember to always call <code>install_signal_handlers</code>
   for every application, and wrap all <code>file</code> accesses with
   <code>safe_mmap_try</code>. Annoying, but manageable. So now you've
   covered POSIX systems, but what about Windows?</p> <h2>Caveat 2:
   Windows</h2> <p>Windows doesn't have <code>mmap</code>, but it does
   have <code>MapViewOfFile</code>. Both of these implement memory mapped
   files, but there's one important difference: Windows keeps a lock on
   the file, not allowing it to be deleted. Even with the Windows flag
   <code>FILE_SHARE_DELETE</code> deletion does not work. This is an issue
   when we expect another application to delete files from under us, such
   as git garbage collection.</p> <p>One way around this with the windows
   API is to essentially disable the system file cache entirely, which
   just makes everything absurdly slow. The way <a
   href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a> handles this is by
   releasing the memory mapped file on idle. Its not a pretty solution,
   but it works.</p> <p>Windows also does not have a SIGBUS signal, but
   you can trivially use structured exception handling in
   <code>safe_mmap_try</code> instead:</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/6.png"> <p>Now all is well, your
   application functions on Windows. But then you decide that you would
   like some crash reporting, to make it easier to identify issues in the
   future. So you add <a
   href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad">Google
   Breakpad</a>, but unbeknownst to you you've just broken Linux and MacOS
   again¦</p> <h2>Caveat 3: 3rd Parties</h2> <p>The problem with using
   signal handlers is that they're global, across threads and libraries.
   If you have or have added a library like Breakpad that uses signals
   internally you're going to break your previously safe memory
   mapping.</p> <p>Breakpad registers signal handlers at initialization
   time on Linux, including one for SIGBUS. These signal handlers override
   each other, so installation order is important. There is not a nice
   solution to these types of situations: You can't simply set and reset
   the signal handler in <code>safe_mmap_try</code> as that would break
   multithreaded applications. At Sublime HQ our solution was to turn an
   unhandled SIGBUS in our signal handler into a SIGSEGV. Not particularly
   elegant but it's a reasonable compromise.</p> <p>On MacOS things get a
   little more complicated. XNU, the MacOS kernel, is based on Mach, one
   of the earliest microkernels. Instead of signals, Mach has an
   asynchronous, message based exception handling mechanism. For
   compatibility reasons signals are also supported, with Mach exceptions
   taking priority. If a library such as Breakpad registers for Mach
   exception messages, and handles those, it will prevent signals from
   being fired. This is of course at odds with our signal handling. The
   only workaround we've found so far involves patching Breakpad to not
   handle SIGBUS.</p> <p>3rd party libraries are a problem because signals
   are global state accessible from everywhere. The only available
   solutions to this are unsatisfying workarounds.</p> <h2>Caveat 4: 32bit
   Support</h2> <p>Memory mapping may not use physical memory, but it does
   require virtual address space. On 32bit platforms your address space is
   ~4GB. So while your application may not use 4GB of memory, it will run
   out of address space if you try to memory map a too large file. This
   has the same result as being out of memory.</p> <p>Sadly this doesn't
   have a workaround like the other issues, it is a hard limitation of how
   memory mapping works. You can now either rewrite the codebase to not
   memory map the whole file, live with crashes on 32bit systems or not
   support 32bit.</p> <p>With <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime
   Merge</a> and <a
   href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-point-2"
   >Sublime Text 3.2</a> we took the "no 32bit support" route. <a
   href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a> does not have a 32bit
   build available and Sublime Text disables git integration on 32bit
   versions.</p> <h2>An Alternative</h2> <p>I mentioned before that you
   can rewrite your code to not use memory mapping. Instead of passing
   around a long lived pointer into a memory mapped file all around the
   codebase, you can use functions such as <code>pread</code> to copy only
   the portions of the file that you require into memory. This is less
   elegant initially than using <code>mmap</code>, but it avoids all the
   problems you're otherwise going to have.</p> <p>Through some quick
   benchmarks for the way <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime
   Merge</a> reads git object files, <code>pread</code> was around ” as
   fast as <code>mmap</code> on linux. In hindsight it's difficult to
   justify using <code>mmap</code> over <code>pread</code>, but now the
   beast has been tamed and there's little reason to change any more.</p>

   we're going to be adding to <a
   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>. This isn't a
   comprehensive list, but it should give an indication of what we're
   focusing on right now.</p> <ul> <li><b>Branch Visualization</b>.
   Sublime Merge itself handles large repositories well, but there's more
   the UI could do to help users with a lot of branches on the go. We've
   got some nice things cooking for this that will be coming in the near
   future. Stay tuned!</li> <li><b>Submodule Management</b>. Sublime Merge
   understands submodules, but doesn't provide any UI for managing them.
   We'll be changing that soon.</li> <li><b>Tabs</b>. Tabs have been
   frequently requested by users working on several repositories at once.
   The <i>Switch Repository</i> functionality (under the <i>File</i> menu)
   helps with this, but tabs have their own benefits, so they're on their
   way.</li> <li><b>Git Flow Integration</b>. Git Flow is a branching
   strategy with an accompanying set of command line tools. We've had a
   lot of requests for UI support here, so it'll be making it in too.</li>
   <li><b>Interactive Rebase</b>. Sublime Merge currently supports editing
   commit messages and squashing commits (available from the commit
   context menu). We'll be adding extra commit wrangling functionality,
   including reordering commits, moving commits between branches, and
   amending arbitrary commits.</li> <li><b>Plugins</b>. Sublime Text style
   plugins are on our radar. This isn't at the top of the list, but
   they're coming.</li> </ul> <p>We'll also be getting a new Sublime Text
   Dev Build out this week, rolling in all the updates from Sublime Merge,
   including the updated theming system and Mojave support.</p>

   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/download">https://www.sublimemerge.c
   om/download</a>)</i></p> <p> There's a company that makes photography
   accessories, called Really Right Stuff. They make lovely equipment, but
   what I really like is the name. It embodies the idea of building
   something that goes beyond the minimum: making it as good as it can be,
   paying attention to the details, and getting it really right. </p> <p>
   When it comes to software, getting it really right goes beyond
   functionality. The feel, aesthetics, and performance all have to be
   there. </p> <p> There's a real pleasure using software that gets it
   really right, as a lot of the time, it doesn't. We're all too familiar
   with clunky layouts, unresponsive buttons, choppy scrolling, tedious
   splash screens, and flickering on every interaction. </p> <p> After
   typing <tt>git add -p</tt> in the terminal one too many times, I
   thought to myself: we've got some pretty great tech in Sublime Text.
   What if we used it to build a Git client? Could we make it fast? Could
   we make it buttery smooth, without flickering or blocking? Could we
   make something that's really, really right? </p> <p> Today, I'd like to
   introduce <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>. It
   combines the UI engine of Sublime Text, with a from-scratch
   implementation of Git*. The result is, to us at least, something pretty
   special. <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com"><img
   src="/screenshots/merge/staging.png" width="600" height="291"
   class="screenshot-sm"></a> <p class="caption-sm">Sublime Merge - Commit
   Dialog</p> </p> <p> You can download <a
   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>, and try it for
   yourself - there's no time limit, no accounts, no metrics, and no
   tracking. The evaluation version is fully functional, but is restricted
   to the light theme only. Individual purchases are buy once, use
   forever, with 3 years of updates included in the purchase. Business
   licenses are available on a subscription basis. Sublime Merge runs on
   Windows, Mac and Linux. </p> <p> It's still early days for Sublime
   Merge - it has only been used by us and our small team of beta testers
   so far. We'd love to hear what you think. We'll be on the <a
   href="https://forum.sublimetext.com/">Forums</a> listening to any
   feedback - let us know how you get on with it! </p> <br> <p><small> *
   We have a custom implementation of Git for reading repositories, which
   drives a lot of our high performance functionality. However we defer to
   Git itself for operations that mutate the repository (Staging,
   Committing, Checking out branches, etc). </small></p> <script> if

   Oct 2017 06:00:00 +0000 Will Bond <p>With the release of Sublime Text
   3.0, we refreshed the visual design for the application, icon, and
   website. The new icon ties into the colors and shapes of the old, but
   is more abstract and fits well with other modern applications. The
   updated Default theme is still distinctly Sublime Text, but has full
   high DPI support, and works well with both dark and light color
   schemes. The three new color schemes take advantage of the work that
   has gone into modernizing and enhancing the syntax definitions included
   with Sublime Text.</p> <table style="margin: 20px 0;"> <tr> <th
   style="color: #777; font-style: italic; padding: 0 20px 12px 0;
   line-height: 1.2"> <b>Sublime Text 3 Build 3126</b><br> <span
   style="font-size: 0.9em">(Old) Default theme, IDLE color scheme</span>
   </th> <th style="color: #777; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2">
   <b>Sublime Text 3.0</b><br> <span style="font-size: 0.9em">(New)
   Default theme, Sixteen color scheme</span> </th> </tr> <tr> <td
   style="padding-right: 30px;"> <img

   src="/screenshots/the_adaptive_theme/3143_default_sixteen.png"
   style="width: 250px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"> </td> </tr>
   </table> <p>As well as an overhaul of the default theme, we've also
   include a new theme, Adaptive, which uses the colors of your color
   scheme and applies variations of them to the side bar and various
   panels. The new color scheme setting <code>accent</code> is used to
   highlight selected options in the find panel, and to highlight modified
   tabs. Furthermore, on recent versions of macOS the title bar is also
   styled by the Adaptive theme to follow your selected color scheme.</p>
   <p>The result is a theme that acts as if it was custom designed for
   your color scheme. Check out this sample of Adaptive in action:</p>

   [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7]

   Use Multiple Selections to rename variables quickly Here Ctrl+DâŒ˜+D is
   used to select the next occurrence of the current word. Once created,
   each selection allows for full-featured editing.
   Quickly jump to files and functions with Goto Anything Here Ctrl+PâŒ˜+P
   is used to open the Goto Anything menu, xcc is used to select the file
   xla_compilation_cache.cc, @ switches to symbol mode, and :c selects the
   XlaCompilationCache::Compile method.
   Navigate source using Goto Definition Here the mouse is hovered over a
   symbol to jump to the definition. The keyboard shortcut F12 can be used
   when the caret is located on a symbol, or Goto Symbol in Project can be
   opened via Ctrl+Shift+Râ‡§+âŒ˜+R to jump to the definition of any symbol in
   the project.
   Unsurpassed performance Here a 7MB source code file is opened, and Goto
   Symbol Ctrl+RâŒ˜+R is used to jump to a function 200k lines down. Full
   editing features are retained for code in large files, or with complex
   syntax.

Some features our users love:

Goto Anything

   Use Goto Anything to open files with only a few keystrokes, and
   instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.

   Triggered with Ctrl+PâŒ˜+P, it is possible to:
     * Type part of a file name to open it.
     * Type @ to jump to symbols, # to search within the file, and : to go
       to a line number.

   These shortcuts can be combined, so tp@rf may take you to a function
   read_file within a file text_parser.py. Similarly, tp:100 would take
   you to line 100 of the same file.

Goto Definition

   Using information from syntax definitions, Sublime Text automatically
   generates a project-wide index of every class, method and function.
   This index powers Goto Definition, which is exposed in three different
   ways:
     * A popup is displayed when hovering over a symbol
     * Pressing F12 when the caret is on a symbol
     * The Goto Symbol in Project functionality

   Symbol indexing can be customized on a per-syntax basis via
   configuration files, allowing users to tailor the feature to their
   needs.

Multiple Selections

   Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple
   selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename
   variables with ease, and manipulate files faster than ever.

   Try pressing Ctrl+Shift+Lâ‡§+âŒ˜+L to split the selection into lines and
   Ctrl+DâŒ˜+D to select the next occurrence of the selected word. To make
   multiple selections with the mouse, take a look at the Column Selection
   documentation.

Command Palette

   The Command Palette holds infrequently used functionality, like
   sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation settings.
   With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you want, without
   ever having to navigate through the menus or remember obscure key
   bindings.

   Show the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+Pâ‡§+âŒ˜+P.

Powerful API and Package Ecosystem

   Sublime Text has a powerful, Python API that allows plugins to augment
   built-in functionality.

   Package Control can be installed via the command palette, providing
   simple access to thousands of packages built by the community.

Customize Anything

   Key bindings, menus, snippets, macros, completions and more - just
   about everything in Sublime Text is customizable with simple JSON
   files. This system gives you flexibility as settings can be specified
   on a per-file type and per-project basis.

Split Editing

   Get the most out of your wide screen monitor with split editing
   support. Edit files side by side, or edit two locations in the one
   file. You can edit with as many rows and columns as you wish. Take
   advantage of multiple monitors by editing with multiple windows, and
   using multiple splits in each window.

   Take a look at the View â–¶ Layout menu for split editing options. To
   open multiple views into the one file, use the File â–¶ New View into
   File menu item.

Instant Project Switch

   Projects in Sublime Text capture the full contents of the workspace,
   including modified and unsaved files. You can switch between projects
   in a manner similar to Goto Anything, and the switch is instant, with
   no save prompts - all your modifications will be restored next time the
   project is opened.

Performance

   Sublime Text is built from custom components, providing for unmatched
   responsiveness. From a powerful, custom cross-platform UI toolkit, to
   an unmatched syntax highlighting engine, Sublime Text sets the bar for
   performance.

Cross Platform

   Sublime Text is available for Mac, Windows and Linux. One license is
   all you need to use Sublime Text on every computer you own, no matter
   what operating system it uses.

   Sublime Text uses a custom UI toolkit, optimized for speed and beauty,
   while taking advantage of native functionality on each platform.

   example project here.</a></i></p> <p>Say you were reading some binary
   format, data you need throughout some application. You take the easiest
   approach and use a simple <code>read</code> to get the full contents of
   the file. You release your software and someone comes along and says:
   "I need to parse this 3GB file, but I only have 2GB of memory. Could
   you make it so that you're not using so much memory?". Of course you
   want to help them, so you do some searching and come to the conclusion
   that memory mapping is the perfect solution to this problem.</p>
   <p>Memory mapped files work by mapping the full file into a virtual
   address space and then using page faults to determine which chunks to
   load into physical memory. In essence it allows you to access the file
   as if you had read the whole thing into memory, without actually doing
   so. Crucially it requires only a small change to the codebase:</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/1.png"> <p>And with that, you've
   fixed the memory usage issue. You've fixed the bug, people are happy
   and all is well until you get another support ticket. Your program is
   crashing with a SIGBUS.</p> <h2>Caveat 1: SIGBUS</h2> <p>SIGBUS (bus
   error) is a signal that happens when you try to access memory that has
   not been physically mapped. This is different to a SIGSEGV
   (segmentation fault) in that a segfault happens when an address is
   invalid, while a bus error means the address is valid but we failed to
   read/write.</p> <p>As it turns out, the ticket comes from someone using
   a networked drive. Their network happened to disconnect while your
   memory mapped file was open, and since the file no longer existed the
   OS couldn't load it into ram for you and gave you a SIGBUS instead.</p>
   <p>Because the OS is loading the file on demand, you now have this
   wonderful issue where any arbitrary read from an address into the
   memory mapped file can and <em>will</em> fail at some point.</p>
   <p>Luckily on POSIX systems we have signal handlers, and SIGBUS is a
   signal we can handle. All you need to do is register a signal handler
   for SIGBUS when the program starts and jump back to our code to handle
   failures there.</p> <img src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/2.png">
   <p>Sadly our code actually has some edge cases we should consider:</p>
   <p>Signal handlers are global, but signals themselves are per-thread.
   So you need to make sure you're not messing with any other threads by
   making all our data thread local. Let's also add some robustness by
   making sure we've called <code>setjmp</code> before
   <code>longjmp</code>.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/3.png"> <p>Using
   <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>ing from a signal handler
   is actually unsafe. It seems to cause undefined behaviour, especially
   on MacOS. Instead we must use <code>sigsetjmp</code> and
   <code>siglongjmp</code>. Since we're jumping out of a signal handler,
   we need that signal handler to not block any future signals, so we must
   also pass <code>SA_NODEFER</code> to <code>sigaction</code>.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/4.png"> <p>This is starting to get
   quite complicated, especially if you were to have multiple places where
   a SIGBUS could happen. Let's factor things out into functions to make
   the logic a little cleaner.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/5.png"> <p>There, now you just
   need to remember to always call <code>install_signal_handlers</code>
   for every application, and wrap all <code>file</code> accesses with
   <code>safe_mmap_try</code>. Annoying, but manageable. So now you've
   covered POSIX systems, but what about Windows?</p> <h2>Caveat 2:
   Windows</h2> <p>Windows doesn't have <code>mmap</code>, but it does
   have <code>MapViewOfFile</code>. Both of these implement memory mapped
   files, but there's one important difference: Windows keeps a lock on
   the file, not allowing it to be deleted. Even with the Windows flag
   <code>FILE_SHARE_DELETE</code> deletion does not work. This is an issue
   when we expect another application to delete files from under us, such
   as git garbage collection.</p> <p>One way around this with the windows
   API is to essentially disable the system file cache entirely, which
   just makes everything absurdly slow. The way <a
   href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a> handles this is by
   releasing the memory mapped file on idle. Its not a pretty solution,
   but it works.</p> <p>Windows also does not have a SIGBUS signal, but
   you can trivially use structured exception handling in
   <code>safe_mmap_try</code> instead:</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/6.png"> <p>Now all is well, your
   application functions on Windows. But then you decide that you would
   like some crash reporting, to make it easier to identify issues in the
   future. So you add <a
   href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad">Google
   Breakpad</a>, but unbeknownst to you you've just broken Linux and MacOS
   again¦</p> <h2>Caveat 3: 3rd Parties</h2> <p>The problem with using
   signal handlers is that they're global, across threads and libraries.
   If you have or have added a library like Breakpad that uses signals
   internally you're going to break your previously safe memory
   mapping.</p> <p>Breakpad registers signal handlers at initialization
   time on Linux, including one for SIGBUS. These signal handlers override
   each other, so installation order is important. There is not a nice
   solution to these types of situations: You can't simply set and reset
   the signal handler in <code>safe_mmap_try</code> as that would break
   multithreaded applications. At Sublime HQ our solution was to turn an
   unhandled SIGBUS in our signal handler into a SIGSEGV. Not particularly
   elegant but it's a reasonable compromise.</p> <p>On MacOS things get a
   little more complicated. XNU, the MacOS kernel, is based on Mach, one
   of the earliest microkernels. Instead of signals, Mach has an
   asynchronous, message based exception handling mechanism. For
   compatibility reasons signals are also supported, with Mach exceptions
   taking priority. If a library such as Breakpad registers for Mach
   exception messages, and handles those, it will prevent signals from
   being fired. This is of course at odds with our signal handling. The
   only workaround we've found so far involves patching Breakpad to not
   handle SIGBUS.</p> <p>3rd party libraries are a problem because signals
   are global state accessible from everywhere. The only available
   solutions to this are unsatisfying workarounds.</p> <h2>Caveat 4: 32bit
   Support</h2> <p>Memory mapping may not use physical memory, but it does
   require virtual address space. On 32bit platforms your address space is
   ~4GB. So while your application may not use 4GB of memory, it will run
   out of address space if you try to memory map a too large file. This
   has the same result as being out of memory.</p> <p>Sadly this doesn't
   have a workaround like the other issues, it is a hard limitation of how
   memory mapping works. You can now either rewrite the codebase to not
   memory map the whole file, live with crashes on 32bit systems or not
   support 32bit.</p> <p>With <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime
   Merge</a> and <a
   href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-point-2"
   >Sublime Text 3.2</a> we took the "no 32bit support" route. <a
   href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a> does not have a 32bit
   build available and Sublime Text disables git integration on 32bit
   versions.</p> <h2>An Alternative</h2> <p>I mentioned before that you
   can rewrite your code to not use memory mapping. Instead of passing
   around a long lived pointer into a memory mapped file all around the
   codebase, you can use functions such as <code>pread</code> to copy only
   the portions of the file that you require into memory. This is less
   elegant initially than using <code>mmap</code>, but it avoids all the
   problems you're otherwise going to have.</p> <p>Through some quick
   benchmarks for the way <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime
   Merge</a> reads git object files, <code>pread</code> was around ” as
   fast as <code>mmap</code> on linux. In hindsight it's difficult to
   justify using <code>mmap</code> over <code>pread</code>, but now the
   beast has been tamed and there's little reason to change any more.</p>

   Mon, 05 Nov 2018 02:00:00 -0500 Will Bond <p> While we continue to add
   more features and polish to the default Sublime Merge experience, we
   know that developers love the ability to tweak their tools. Sublime
   Merge is built on the same foundation as Sublime Text, so you can tweak
   key bindings, menus, command palette entries, and even the look and
   feel of the UI. </p> <p> To assist, we™ve just rolled out a number of <a
   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/docs/">pages of documentation</a>
   for users who wish to customize Sublime Merge to look and function a
   little differently. In addition, we™ve added a <a
   href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/dev/">new documentation
   section</a> for the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3dev">dev

   Oct 2018 10:00:00 +1000 Jon Skinner <p>Just a quick post about what
   we're going to be adding to <a
   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>. This isn't a
   comprehensive list, but it should give an indication of what we're
   focusing on right now.</p> <ul> <li><b>Branch Visualization</b>.
   Sublime Merge itself handles large repositories well, but there's more
   the UI could do to help users with a lot of branches on the go. We've
   got some nice things cooking for this that will be coming in the near
   future. Stay tuned!</li> <li><b>Submodule Management</b>. Sublime Merge
   understands submodules, but doesn't provide any UI for managing them.
   We'll be changing that soon.</li> <li><b>Tabs</b>. Tabs have been
   frequently requested by users working on several repositories at once.
   The <i>Switch Repository</i> functionality (under the <i>File</i> menu)
   helps with this, but tabs have their own benefits, so they're on their
   way.</li> <li><b>Git Flow Integration</b>. Git Flow is a branching
   strategy with an accompanying set of command line tools. We've had a
   lot of requests for UI support here, so it'll be making it in too.</li>
   <li><b>Interactive Rebase</b>. Sublime Merge currently supports editing
   commit messages and squashing commits (available from the commit
   context menu). We'll be adding extra commit wrangling functionality,
   including reordering commits, moving commits between branches, and
   amending arbitrary commits.</li> <li><b>Plugins</b>. Sublime Text style
   plugins are on our radar. This isn't at the top of the list, but
   they're coming.</li> </ul> <p>We'll also be getting a new Sublime Text
   Dev Build out this week, rolling in all the updates from Sublime Merge,
   including the updated theming system and Mojave support.</p>

   accessories, called Really Right Stuff. They make lovely equipment, but
   what I really like is the name. It embodies the idea of building
   something that goes beyond the minimum: making it as good as it can be,
   paying attention to the details, and getting it really right. </p> <p>
   When it comes to software, getting it really right goes beyond
   functionality. The feel, aesthetics, and performance all have to be
   there. </p> <p> There's a real pleasure using software that gets it
   really right, as a lot of the time, it doesn't. We're all too familiar
   with clunky layouts, unresponsive buttons, choppy scrolling, tedious
   splash screens, and flickering on every interaction. </p> <p> After
   typing <tt>git add -p</tt> in the terminal one too many times, I
   thought to myself: we've got some pretty great tech in Sublime Text.
   What if we used it to build a Git client? Could we make it fast? Could
   we make it buttery smooth, without flickering or blocking? Could we
   make something that's really, really right? </p> <p> Today, I'd like to
   introduce <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>. It
   combines the UI engine of Sublime Text, with a from-scratch
   implementation of Git*. The result is, to us at least, something pretty
   special. <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com"><img

   tracking. The evaluation version is fully functional, but is restricted
   to the light theme only. Individual purchases are buy once, use
   forever, with 3 years of updates included in the purchase. Business
   licenses are available on a subscription basis. Sublime Merge runs on

   feedback - let us know how you get on with it! </p> <br> <p><small> *

   Oct 2017 06:00:00 +0000 Will Bond <p>With the release of Sublime Text
   3.0, we refreshed the visual design for the application, icon, and
   website. The new icon ties into the colors and shapes of the old, but
   is more abstract and fits well with other modern applications. The
   updated Default theme is still distinctly Sublime Text, but has full
   high DPI support, and works well with both dark and light color
   schemes. The three new color schemes take advantage of the work that
   has gone into modernizing and enhancing the syntax definitions included
   with Sublime Text.</p> <table style="margin: 20px 0;"> <tr> <th
   style="color: #777; font-style: italic; padding: 0 20px 12px 0;
   line-height: 1.2"> <b>Sublime Text 3 Build 3126</b><br> <span
   style="font-size: 0.9em">(Old) Default theme, IDLE color scheme</span>
   </th> <th style="color: #777; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2">
   <b>Sublime Text 3.0</b><br> <span style="font-size: 0.9em">(New)
   Default theme, Sixteen color scheme</span> </th> </tr> <tr> <td

   style="width: 250px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"> </td> </tr>
   </table> <p>As well as an overhaul of the default theme, we've also
   include a new theme, Adaptive, which uses the colors of your color
   scheme and applies variations of them to the side bar and various
   panels. The new color scheme setting <code>accent</code> is used to
   highlight selected options in the find panel, and to highlight modified
   tabs. Furthermore, on recent versions of macOS the title bar is also
   styled by the Adaptive theme to follow your selected color scheme.</p>
   <p>The result is a theme that acts as if it was custom designed for
   your color scheme. Check out this sample of Adaptive in action:</p>

   Use Multiple Selections to rename variables quickly Here Ctrl+DâŒ˜+D is
   used to select the next occurrence of the current word. Once created,
   each selection allows for full-featured editing.
   Quickly jump to files and functions with Goto Anything Here Ctrl+PâŒ˜+P
   is used to open the Goto Anything menu, xcc is used to select the file
   xla_compilation_cache.cc, @ switches to symbol mode, and :c selects the
   XlaCompilationCache::Compile method.
   Navigate source using Goto Definition Here the mouse is hovered over a
   symbol to jump to the definition. The keyboard shortcut F12 can be used
   when the caret is located on a symbol, or Goto Symbol in Project can be
   opened via Ctrl+Shift+Râ‡§+âŒ˜+R to jump to the definition of any symbol in
   the project.
   Unsurpassed performance Here a 7MB source code file is opened, and Goto
   Symbol Ctrl+RâŒ˜+R is used to jump to a function 200k lines down. Full
   editing features are retained for code in large files, or with complex
   syntax.

Some features our users love:

Goto Anything

   Use Goto Anything to open files with only a few keystrokes, and
   instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.

   Triggered with Ctrl+PâŒ˜+P, it is possible to:
     * Type part of a file name to open it.
     * Type @ to jump to symbols, # to search within the file, and : to go
       to a line number.

   These shortcuts can be combined, so tp@rf may take you to a function
   read_file within a file text_parser.py. Similarly, tp:100 would take
   you to line 100 of the same file.

Goto Definition

   Using information from syntax definitions, Sublime Text automatically
   generates a project-wide index of every class, method and function.
   This index powers Goto Definition, which is exposed in three different
   ways:
     * A popup is displayed when hovering over a symbol
     * Pressing F12 when the caret is on a symbol
     * The Goto Symbol in Project functionality

   Symbol indexing can be customized on a per-syntax basis via
   configuration files, allowing users to tailor the feature to their
   needs.

Multiple Selections

   Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple
   selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename
   variables with ease, and manipulate files faster than ever.

   Try pressing Ctrl+Shift+Lâ‡§+âŒ˜+L to split the selection into lines and
   Ctrl+DâŒ˜+D to select the next occurrence of the selected word. To make
   multiple selections with the mouse, take a look at the Column Selection
   documentation.

Command Palette

   The Command Palette holds infrequently used functionality, like
   sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation settings.
   With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you want, without
   ever having to navigate through the menus or remember obscure key
   bindings.

   Show the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+Pâ‡§+âŒ˜+P.

Powerful API and Package Ecosystem

   Sublime Text has a powerful, Python API that allows plugins to augment
   built-in functionality.

   Package Control can be installed via the command palette, providing
   simple access to thousands of packages built by the community.

Customize Anything

   Key bindings, menus, snippets, macros, completions and more - just
   about everything in Sublime Text is customizable with simple JSON
   files. This system gives you flexibility as settings can be specified
   on a per-file type and per-project basis.

Split Editing

   Get the most out of your wide screen monitor with split editing
   support. Edit files side by side, or edit two locations in the one
   file. You can edit with as many rows and columns as you wish. Take
   advantage of multiple monitors by editing with multiple windows, and
   using multiple splits in each window.

   Take a look at the View â–¶ Layout menu for split editing options. To
   open multiple views into the one file, use the File â–¶ New View into
   File menu item.

Instant Project Switch

   Projects in Sublime Text capture the full contents of the workspace,
   including modified and unsaved files. You can switch between projects
   in a manner similar to Goto Anything, and the switch is instant, with
   no save prompts - all your modifications will be restored next time the
   project is opened.

Performance

   Sublime Text is built from custom components, providing for unmatched
   responsiveness. From a powerful, custom cross-platform UI toolkit, to
   an unmatched syntax highlighting engine, Sublime Text sets the bar for
   performance.

Cross Platform

   Sublime Text is available for Mac, Windows and Linux. One license is
   all you need to use Sublime Text on every computer you own, no matter
   what operating system it uses.

   Sublime Text uses a custom UI toolkit, optimized for speed and beauty,
   while taking advantage of native functionality on each platform.

   https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/use-mmap-with-care Tue, 2 May
   2019 01:00:00 +0000 Benjamin Schaaf <p>When we implemented the git
   portion of <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>, we
   chose to use <code>mmap</code> for reading git object files. This
   turned out to be considerably more difficult than we had first thought.
   Using <code>mmap</code> in desktop applications has some serious
   caveats, and here's why:</p> <p><i>You can follow along with <a
   href="https://github.com/sublimehq/mmap-example" target="_blank">the
   example project here.</a></i></p> <p>Say you were reading some binary
   format, data you need throughout some application. You take the easiest
   approach and use a simple <code>read</code> to get the full contents of
   the file. You release your software and someone comes along and says:
   "I need to parse this 3GB file, but I only have 2GB of memory. Could
   you make it so that you're not using so much memory?". Of course you
   want to help them, so you do some searching and come to the conclusion
   that memory mapping is the perfect solution to this problem.</p>
   <p>Memory mapped files work by mapping the full file into a virtual
   address space and then using page faults to determine which chunks to
   load into physical memory. In essence it allows you to access the file
   as if you had read the whole thing into memory, without actually doing
   so. Crucially it requires only a small change to the codebase:</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/1.png"> <p>And with that, you've
   fixed the memory usage issue. You've fixed the bug, people are happy
   and all is well until you get another support ticket. Your program is
   crashing with a SIGBUS.</p> <h2>Caveat 1: SIGBUS</h2> <p>SIGBUS (bus
   error) is a signal that happens when you try to access memory that has
   not been physically mapped. This is different to a SIGSEGV
   (segmentation fault) in that a segfault happens when an address is
   invalid, while a bus error means the address is valid but we failed to
   read/write.</p> <p>As it turns out, the ticket comes from someone using
   a networked drive. Their network happened to disconnect while your
   memory mapped file was open, and since the file no longer existed the
   OS couldn't load it into ram for you and gave you a SIGBUS instead.</p>
   <p>Because the OS is loading the file on demand, you now have this
   wonderful issue where any arbitrary read from an address into the
   memory mapped file can and <em>will</em> fail at some point.</p>
   <p>Luckily on POSIX systems we have signal handlers, and SIGBUS is a
   signal we can handle. All you need to do is register a signal handler
   for SIGBUS when the program starts and jump back to our code to handle
   failures there.</p> <img src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/2.png">
   <p>Sadly our code actually has some edge cases we should consider:</p>
   <p>Signal handlers are global, but signals themselves are per-thread.
   So you need to make sure you're not messing with any other threads by
   making all our data thread local. Let's also add some robustness by
   making sure we've called <code>setjmp</code> before
   <code>longjmp</code>.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/3.png"> <p>Using
   <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>ing from a signal handler
   is actually unsafe. It seems to cause undefined behaviour, especially
   on MacOS. Instead we must use <code>sigsetjmp</code> and
   <code>siglongjmp</code>. Since we're jumping out of a signal handler,
   we need that signal handler to not block any future signals, so we must
   also pass <code>SA_NODEFER</code> to <code>sigaction</code>.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/4.png"> <p>This is starting to get
   quite complicated, especially if you were to have multiple places where
   a SIGBUS could happen. Let's factor things out into functions to make
   the logic a little cleaner.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/5.png"> <p>There, now you just
   need to remember to always call <code>install_signal_handlers</code>
   for every application, and wrap all <code>file</code> accesses with
   <code>safe_mmap_try</code>. Annoying, but manageable. So now you've
   covered POSIX systems, but what about Windows?</p> <h2>Caveat 2:
   Windows</h2> <p>Windows doesn't have <code>mmap</code>, but it does
   have <code>MapViewOfFile</code>. Both of these implement memory mapped
   files, but there's one important difference: Windows keeps a lock on
   the file, not allowing it to be deleted. Even with the Windows flag
   <code>FILE_SHARE_DELETE</code> deletion does not work. This is an issue
   when we expect another application to delete files from under us, such
   as git garbage collection.</p> <p>One way around this with the windows
   API is to essentially disable the system file cache entirely, which
   just makes everything absurdly slow. The way <a
   href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a> handles this is by
   releasing the memory mapped file on idle. Its not a pretty solution,
   but it works.</p> <p>Windows also does not have a SIGBUS signal, but
   you can trivially use structured exception handling in
   <code>safe_mmap_try</code> instead:</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/6.png"> <p>Now all is well, your
   application functions on Windows. But then you decide that you would
   like some crash reporting, to make it easier to identify issues in the
   future. So you add <a
   href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad">Google
   Breakpad</a>, but unbeknownst to you you've just broken Linux and MacOS
   again¦</p> <h2>Caveat 3: 3rd Parties</h2> <p>The problem with using
   signal handlers is that they're global, across threads and libraries.
   If you have or have added a library like Breakpad that uses signals
   internally you're going to break your previously safe memory
   mapping.</p> <p>Breakpad registers signal handlers at initialization
   time on Linux, including one for SIGBUS. These signal handlers override
   each other, so installation order is important. There is not a nice
   solution to these types of situations: You can't simply set and reset
   the signal handler in <code>safe_mmap_try</code> as that would break
   multithreaded applications. At Sublime HQ our solution was to turn an
   unhandled SIGBUS in our signal handler into a SIGSEGV. Not particularly
   elegant but it's a reasonable compromise.</p> <p>On MacOS things get a
   little more complicated. XNU, the MacOS kernel, is based on Mach, one
   of the earliest microkernels. Instead of signals, Mach has an
   asynchronous, message based exception handling mechanism. For
   compatibility reasons signals are also supported, with Mach exceptions
   taking priority. If a library such as Breakpad registers for Mach
   exception messages, and handles those, it will prevent signals from
   being fired. This is of course at odds with our signal handling. The
   only workaround we've found so far involves patching Breakpad to not
   handle SIGBUS.</p> <p>3rd party libraries are a problem because signals
   are global state accessible from everywhere. The only available
   solutions to this are unsatisfying workarounds.</p> <h2>Caveat 4: 32bit
   Support</h2> <p>Memory mapping may not use physical memory, but it does
   require virtual address space. On 32bit platforms your address space is
   ~4GB. So while your application may not use 4GB of memory, it will run
   out of address space if you try to memory map a too large file. This
   has the same result as being out of memory.</p> <p>Sadly this doesn't
   have a workaround like the other issues, it is a hard limitation of how
   memory mapping works. You can now either rewrite the codebase to not
   memory map the whole file, live with crashes on 32bit systems or not
   support 32bit.</p> <p>With <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime
   Merge</a> and <a
   href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-point-2"
   >Sublime Text 3.2</a> we took the "no 32bit support" route. <a
   href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a> does not have a 32bit
   build available and Sublime Text disables git integration on 32bit
   versions.</p> <h2>An Alternative</h2> <p>I mentioned before that you
   can rewrite your code to not use memory mapping. Instead of passing
   around a long lived pointer into a memory mapped file all around the
   codebase, you can use functions such as <code>pread</code> to copy only
   the portions of the file that you require into memory. This is less
   elegant initially than using <code>mmap</code>, but it avoids all the
   problems you're otherwise going to have.</p> <p>Through some quick
   benchmarks for the way <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime
   Merge</a> reads git object files, <code>pread</code> was around ” as
   fast as <code>mmap</code> on linux. In hindsight it's difficult to
   justify using <code>mmap</code> over <code>pread</code>, but now the
   beast has been tamed and there's little reason to change any more.</p>

   Mon, 05 Nov 2018 02:00:00 -0500 Will Bond <p> While we continue to add
   more features and polish to the default Sublime Merge experience, we
   know that developers love the ability to tweak their tools. Sublime
   Merge is built on the same foundation as Sublime Text, so you can tweak
   key bindings, menus, command palette entries, and even the look and
   feel of the UI. </p> <p> To assist, we™ve just rolled out a number of <a
   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/docs/">pages of documentation</a>
   for users who wish to customize Sublime Merge to look and function a
   little differently. In addition, we™ve added a <a
   href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/dev/">new documentation
   section</a> for the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3dev">dev
   builds of Sublime Text</a>. It covers all of the features we added
   during the development of Sublime Merge. </p>

   Oct 2018 10:00:00 +1000 Jon Skinner <p>Just a quick post about what
   we're going to be adding to <a
   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>. This isn't a
   comprehensive list, but it should give an indication of what we're
   focusing on right now.</p> <ul> <li><b>Branch Visualization</b>.
   Sublime Merge itself handles large repositories well, but there's more
   the UI could do to help users with a lot of branches on the go. We've
   got some nice things cooking for this that will be coming in the near
   future. Stay tuned!</li> <li><b>Submodule Management</b>. Sublime Merge
   understands submodules, but doesn't provide any UI for managing them.
   We'll be changing that soon.</li> <li><b>Tabs</b>. Tabs have been
   frequently requested by users working on several repositories at once.
   The <i>Switch Repository</i> functionality (under the <i>File</i> menu)
   helps with this, but tabs have their own benefits, so they're on their
   way.</li> <li><b>Git Flow Integration</b>. Git Flow is a branching
   strategy with an accompanying set of command line tools. We've had a
   lot of requests for UI support here, so it'll be making it in too.</li>
   <li><b>Interactive Rebase</b>. Sublime Merge currently supports editing
   commit messages and squashing commits (available from the commit
   context menu). We'll be adding extra commit wrangling functionality,
   including reordering commits, moving commits between branches, and
   amending arbitrary commits.</li> <li><b>Plugins</b>. Sublime Text style
   plugins are on our radar. This isn't at the top of the list, but
   they're coming.</li> </ul> <p>We'll also be getting a new Sublime Text
   Dev Build out this week, rolling in all the updates from Sublime Merge,
   including the updated theming system and Mojave support.</p>

   accessories, called Really Right Stuff. They make lovely equipment, but
   what I really like is the name. It embodies the idea of building
   something that goes beyond the minimum: making it as good as it can be,
   paying attention to the details, and getting it really right. </p> <p>
   When it comes to software, getting it really right goes beyond
   functionality. The feel, aesthetics, and performance all have to be
   there. </p> <p> There's a real pleasure using software that gets it
   really right, as a lot of the time, it doesn't. We're all too familiar
   with clunky layouts, unresponsive buttons, choppy scrolling, tedious
   splash screens, and flickering on every interaction. </p> <p> After
   typing <tt>git add -p</tt> in the terminal one too many times, I
   thought to myself: we've got some pretty great tech in Sublime Text.
   What if we used it to build a Git client? Could we make it fast? Could
   we make it buttery smooth, without flickering or blocking? Could we
   make something that's really, really right? </p> <p> Today, I'd like to
   introduce <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>. It
   combines the UI engine of Sublime Text, with a from-scratch
   implementation of Git*. The result is, to us at least, something pretty
   special. <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com"><img
   src="/screenshots/merge/staging.png" width="600" height="291"

   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>, and try it for
   yourself - there's no time limit, no accounts, no metrics, and no
   tracking. The evaluation version is fully functional, but is restricted
   to the light theme only. Individual purchases are buy once, use
   forever, with 3 years of updates included in the purchase. Business
   licenses are available on a subscription basis. Sublime Merge runs on
   Windows, Mac and Linux. </p> <p> It's still early days for Sublime
   Merge - it has only been used by us and our small team of beta testers
   so far. We'd love to hear what you think. We'll be on the <a
   href="https://forum.sublimetext.com/">Forums</a> listening to any
   feedback - let us know how you get on with it! </p> <br> <p><small> *
   We have a custom implementation of Git for reading repositories, which
   drives a lot of our high performance functionality. However we defer to
   Git itself for operations that mutate the repository (Staging,
   Committing, Checking out branches, etc). </small></p> <script> if

   website. The new icon ties into the colors and shapes of the old, but
   is more abstract and fits well with other modern applications. The
   updated Default theme is still distinctly Sublime Text, but has full
   high DPI support, and works well with both dark and light color
   schemes. The three new color schemes take advantage of the work that
   has gone into modernizing and enhancing the syntax definitions included
   with Sublime Text.</p> <table style="margin: 20px 0;"> <tr> <th
   style="color: #777; font-style: italic; padding: 0 20px 12px 0;

   style="width: 250px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"> </td> </tr>
   </table> <p>As well as an overhaul of the default theme, we've also
   include a new theme, Adaptive, which uses the colors of your color
   scheme and applies variations of them to the side bar and various
   panels. The new color scheme setting <code>accent</code> is used to
   highlight selected options in the find panel, and to highlight modified
   tabs. Furthermore, on recent versions of macOS the title bar is also
   styled by the Adaptive theme to follow your selected color scheme.</p>
   <p>The result is a theme that acts as if it was custom designed for
   your color scheme. Check out this sample of Adaptive in action:</p>

   [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7]

   Use Multiple Selections to rename variables quickly Here Ctrl+DâŒ˜+D is
   used to select the next occurrence of the current word. Once created,
   each selection allows for full-featured editing.
   Quickly jump to files and functions with Goto Anything Here Ctrl+PâŒ˜+P
   is used to open the Goto Anything menu, xcc is used to select the file
   xla_compilation_cache.cc, @ switches to symbol mode, and :c selects the
   XlaCompilationCache::Compile method.
   Navigate source using Goto Definition Here the mouse is hovered over a
   symbol to jump to the definition. The keyboard shortcut F12 can be used
   when the caret is located on a symbol, or Goto Symbol in Project can be
   opened via Ctrl+Shift+Râ‡§+âŒ˜+R to jump to the definition of any symbol in
   the project.
   Unsurpassed performance Here a 7MB source code file is opened, and Goto
   Symbol Ctrl+RâŒ˜+R is used to jump to a function 200k lines down. Full
   editing features are retained for code in large files, or with complex
   syntax.

Some features our users love:

Goto Anything

   Use Goto Anything to open files with only a few keystrokes, and
   instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.

   Triggered with Ctrl+PâŒ˜+P, it is possible to:
     * Type part of a file name to open it.
     * Type @ to jump to symbols, # to search within the file, and : to go
       to a line number.

   These shortcuts can be combined, so tp@rf may take you to a function
   read_file within a file text_parser.py. Similarly, tp:100 would take
   you to line 100 of the same file.

Goto Definition

   Using information from syntax definitions, Sublime Text automatically
   generates a project-wide index of every class, method and function.
   This index powers Goto Definition, which is exposed in three different
   ways:
     * A popup is displayed when hovering over a symbol
     * Pressing F12 when the caret is on a symbol
     * The Goto Symbol in Project functionality

   Symbol indexing can be customized on a per-syntax basis via
   configuration files, allowing users to tailor the feature to their
   needs.

Multiple Selections

   Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple
   selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename
   variables with ease, and manipulate files faster than ever.

   Try pressing Ctrl+Shift+Lâ‡§+âŒ˜+L to split the selection into lines and
   Ctrl+DâŒ˜+D to select the next occurrence of the selected word. To make
   multiple selections with the mouse, take a look at the Column Selection
   documentation.

Command Palette

   The Command Palette holds infrequently used functionality, like
   sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation settings.
   With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you want, without
   ever having to navigate through the menus or remember obscure key
   bindings.

   Show the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+Pâ‡§+âŒ˜+P.

Powerful API and Package Ecosystem

   Sublime Text has a powerful, Python API that allows plugins to augment
   built-in functionality.

   Package Control can be installed via the command palette, providing
   simple access to thousands of packages built by the community.

Customize Anything

   Key bindings, menus, snippets, macros, completions and more - just
   about everything in Sublime Text is customizable with simple JSON
   files. This system gives you flexibility as settings can be specified
   on a per-file type and per-project basis.

Split Editing

   Get the most out of your wide screen monitor with split editing
   support. Edit files side by side, or edit two locations in the one
   file. You can edit with as many rows and columns as you wish. Take
   advantage of multiple monitors by editing with multiple windows, and
   using multiple splits in each window.

   Take a look at the View â–¶ Layout menu for split editing options. To
   open multiple views into the one file, use the File â–¶ New View into
   File menu item.

Instant Project Switch

   Projects in Sublime Text capture the full contents of the workspace,
   including modified and unsaved files. You can switch between projects
   in a manner similar to Goto Anything, and the switch is instant, with
   no save prompts - all your modifications will be restored next time the
   project is opened.

Performance

   Sublime Text is built from custom components, providing for unmatched
   responsiveness. From a powerful, custom cross-platform UI toolkit, to
   an unmatched syntax highlighting engine, Sublime Text sets the bar for
   performance.

Cross Platform

   Sublime Text is available for Mac, Windows and Linux. One license is
   all you need to use Sublime Text on every computer you own, no matter
   what operating system it uses.

   Sublime Text uses a custom UI toolkit, optimized for speed and beauty,
   while taking advantage of native functionality on each platform.

   https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/use-mmap-with-care Tue, 2 May
   2019 01:00:00 +0000 Benjamin Schaaf <p>When we implemented the git
   portion of <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>, we
   chose to use <code>mmap</code> for reading git object files. This
   turned out to be considerably more difficult than we had first thought.
   Using <code>mmap</code> in desktop applications has some serious
   caveats, and here's why:</p> <p><i>You can follow along with <a
   href="https://github.com/sublimehq/mmap-example" target="_blank">the
   example project here.</a></i></p> <p>Say you were reading some binary
   format, data you need throughout some application. You take the easiest
   approach and use a simple <code>read</code> to get the full contents of
   the file. You release your software and someone comes along and says:
   "I need to parse this 3GB file, but I only have 2GB of memory. Could
   you make it so that you're not using so much memory?". Of course you
   want to help them, so you do some searching and come to the conclusion
   that memory mapping is the perfect solution to this problem.</p>
   <p>Memory mapped files work by mapping the full file into a virtual
   address space and then using page faults to determine which chunks to
   load into physical memory. In essence it allows you to access the file
   as if you had read the whole thing into memory, without actually doing
   so. Crucially it requires only a small change to the codebase:</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/1.png"> <p>And with that, you've
   fixed the memory usage issue. You've fixed the bug, people are happy
   and all is well until you get another support ticket. Your program is
   crashing with a SIGBUS.</p> <h2>Caveat 1: SIGBUS</h2> <p>SIGBUS (bus
   error) is a signal that happens when you try to access memory that has
   not been physically mapped. This is different to a SIGSEGV
   (segmentation fault) in that a segfault happens when an address is
   invalid, while a bus error means the address is valid but we failed to
   read/write.</p> <p>As it turns out, the ticket comes from someone using
   a networked drive. Their network happened to disconnect while your
   memory mapped file was open, and since the file no longer existed the
   OS couldn't load it into ram for you and gave you a SIGBUS instead.</p>
   <p>Because the OS is loading the file on demand, you now have this
   wonderful issue where any arbitrary read from an address into the
   memory mapped file can and <em>will</em> fail at some point.</p>
   <p>Luckily on POSIX systems we have signal handlers, and SIGBUS is a
   signal we can handle. All you need to do is register a signal handler
   for SIGBUS when the program starts and jump back to our code to handle
   failures there.</p> <img src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/2.png">
   <p>Sadly our code actually has some edge cases we should consider:</p>
   <p>Signal handlers are global, but signals themselves are per-thread.
   So you need to make sure you're not messing with any other threads by
   making all our data thread local. Let's also add some robustness by
   making sure we've called <code>setjmp</code> before
   <code>longjmp</code>.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/3.png"> <p>Using
   <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>ing from a signal handler
   is actually unsafe. It seems to cause undefined behaviour, especially
   on MacOS. Instead we must use <code>sigsetjmp</code> and
   <code>siglongjmp</code>. Since we're jumping out of a signal handler,
   we need that signal handler to not block any future signals, so we must
   also pass <code>SA_NODEFER</code> to <code>sigaction</code>.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/4.png"> <p>This is starting to get
   quite complicated, especially if you were to have multiple places where
   a SIGBUS could happen. Let's factor things out into functions to make
   the logic a little cleaner.</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/5.png"> <p>There, now you just
   need to remember to always call <code>install_signal_handlers</code>
   for every application, and wrap all <code>file</code> accesses with
   <code>safe_mmap_try</code>. Annoying, but manageable. So now you've
   covered POSIX systems, but what about Windows?</p> <h2>Caveat 2:
   Windows</h2> <p>Windows doesn't have <code>mmap</code>, but it does
   have <code>MapViewOfFile</code>. Both of these implement memory mapped
   files, but there's one important difference: Windows keeps a lock on
   the file, not allowing it to be deleted. Even with the Windows flag
   <code>FILE_SHARE_DELETE</code> deletion does not work. This is an issue
   when we expect another application to delete files from under us, such
   as git garbage collection.</p> <p>One way around this with the windows
   API is to essentially disable the system file cache entirely, which
   just makes everything absurdly slow. The way <a
   href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a> handles this is by
   releasing the memory mapped file on idle. Its not a pretty solution,
   but it works.</p> <p>Windows also does not have a SIGBUS signal, but
   you can trivially use structured exception handling in
   <code>safe_mmap_try</code> instead:</p> <img
   src="/screenshots/use_mmap_with_care/6.png"> <p>Now all is well, your
   application functions on Windows. But then you decide that you would
   like some crash reporting, to make it easier to identify issues in the
   future. So you add <a
   href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad">Google
   Breakpad</a>, but unbeknownst to you you've just broken Linux and MacOS
   again¦</p> <h2>Caveat 3: 3rd Parties</h2> <p>The problem with using
   signal handlers is that they're global, across threads and libraries.
   If you have or have added a library like Breakpad that uses signals
   internally you're going to break your previously safe memory
   mapping.</p> <p>Breakpad registers signal handlers at initialization
   time on Linux, including one for SIGBUS. These signal handlers override
   each other, so installation order is important. There is not a nice
   solution to these types of situations: You can't simply set and reset
   the signal handler in <code>safe_mmap_try</code> as that would break
   multithreaded applications. At Sublime HQ our solution was to turn an
   unhandled SIGBUS in our signal handler into a SIGSEGV. Not particularly
   elegant but it's a reasonable compromise.</p> <p>On MacOS things get a
   little more complicated. XNU, the MacOS kernel, is based on Mach, one
   of the earliest microkernels. Instead of signals, Mach has an
   asynchronous, message based exception handling mechanism. For
   compatibility reasons signals are also supported, with Mach exceptions
   taking priority. If a library such as Breakpad registers for Mach
   exception messages, and handles those, it will prevent signals from
   being fired. This is of course at odds with our signal handling. The
   only workaround we've found so far involves patching Breakpad to not
   handle SIGBUS.</p> <p>3rd party libraries are a problem because signals
   are global state accessible from everywhere. The only available
   solutions to this are unsatisfying workarounds.</p> <h2>Caveat 4: 32bit
   Support</h2> <p>Memory mapping may not use physical memory, but it does
   require virtual address space. On 32bit platforms your address space is
   ~4GB. So while your application may not use 4GB of memory, it will run
   out of address space if you try to memory map a too large file. This
   has the same result as being out of memory.</p> <p>Sadly this doesn't
   have a workaround like the other issues, it is a hard limitation of how
   memory mapping works. You can now either rewrite the codebase to not
   memory map the whole file, live with crashes on 32bit systems or not
   support 32bit.</p> <p>With <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime
   Merge</a> and <a
   href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-point-2"
   >Sublime Text 3.2</a> we took the "no 32bit support" route. <a
   href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a> does not have a 32bit
   build available and Sublime Text disables git integration on 32bit
   versions.</p> <h2>An Alternative</h2> <p>I mentioned before that you
   can rewrite your code to not use memory mapping. Instead of passing
   around a long lived pointer into a memory mapped file all around the
   codebase, you can use functions such as <code>pread</code> to copy only
   the portions of the file that you require into memory. This is less
   elegant initially than using <code>mmap</code>, but it avoids all the
   problems you're otherwise going to have.</p> <p>Through some quick
   benchmarks for the way <a href="https://sublimemerge.com">Sublime
   Merge</a> reads git object files, <code>pread</code> was around ” as
   fast as <code>mmap</code> on linux. In hindsight it's difficult to
   justify using <code>mmap</code> over <code>pread</code>, but now the
   beast has been tamed and there's little reason to change any more.</p>

   Mon, 05 Nov 2018 02:00:00 -0500 Will Bond <p> While we continue to add
   more features and polish to the default Sublime Merge experience, we
   know that developers love the ability to tweak their tools. Sublime
   Merge is built on the same foundation as Sublime Text, so you can tweak
   key bindings, menus, command palette entries, and even the look and
   feel of the UI. </p> <p> To assist, we™ve just rolled out a number of <a
   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/docs/">pages of documentation</a>
   for users who wish to customize Sublime Merge to look and function a
   little differently. In addition, we™ve added a <a
   href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/dev/">new documentation
   section</a> for the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3dev">dev
   builds of Sublime Text</a>. It covers all of the features we added
   during the development of Sublime Merge. </p>

   Oct 2018 10:00:00 +1000 Jon Skinner <p>Just a quick post about what
   we're going to be adding to <a
   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>. This isn't a
   comprehensive list, but it should give an indication of what we're
   focusing on right now.</p> <ul> <li><b>Branch Visualization</b>.
   Sublime Merge itself handles large repositories well, but there's more
   the UI could do to help users with a lot of branches on the go. We've
   got some nice things cooking for this that will be coming in the near
   future. Stay tuned!</li> <li><b>Submodule Management</b>. Sublime Merge
   understands submodules, but doesn't provide any UI for managing them.
   We'll be changing that soon.</li> <li><b>Tabs</b>. Tabs have been
   frequently requested by users working on several repositories at once.
   The <i>Switch Repository</i> functionality (under the <i>File</i> menu)
   helps with this, but tabs have their own benefits, so they're on their
   way.</li> <li><b>Git Flow Integration</b>. Git Flow is a branching
   strategy with an accompanying set of command line tools. We've had a
   lot of requests for UI support here, so it'll be making it in too.</li>
   <li><b>Interactive Rebase</b>. Sublime Merge currently supports editing
   commit messages and squashing commits (available from the commit
   context menu). We'll be adding extra commit wrangling functionality,
   including reordering commits, moving commits between branches, and
   amending arbitrary commits.</li> <li><b>Plugins</b>. Sublime Text style
   plugins are on our radar. This isn't at the top of the list, but
   they're coming.</li> </ul> <p>We'll also be getting a new Sublime Text
   Dev Build out this week, rolling in all the updates from Sublime Merge,
   including the updated theming system and Mojave support.</p>

   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/download">https://www.sublimemerge.c
   om/download</a>)</i></p> <p> There's a company that makes photography
   accessories, called Really Right Stuff. They make lovely equipment, but
   what I really like is the name. It embodies the idea of building
   something that goes beyond the minimum: making it as good as it can be,
   paying attention to the details, and getting it really right. </p> <p>
   When it comes to software, getting it really right goes beyond
   functionality. The feel, aesthetics, and performance all have to be
   there. </p> <p> There's a real pleasure using software that gets it
   really right, as a lot of the time, it doesn't. We're all too familiar
   with clunky layouts, unresponsive buttons, choppy scrolling, tedious
   splash screens, and flickering on every interaction. </p> <p> After
   typing <tt>git add -p</tt> in the terminal one too many times, I
   thought to myself: we've got some pretty great tech in Sublime Text.
   What if we used it to build a Git client? Could we make it fast? Could
   we make it buttery smooth, without flickering or blocking? Could we
   make something that's really, really right? </p> <p> Today, I'd like to
   introduce <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>. It
   combines the UI engine of Sublime Text, with a from-scratch
   implementation of Git*. The result is, to us at least, something pretty
   special. <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com"><img
   src="/screenshots/merge/staging.png" width="600" height="291"
   class="screenshot-sm"></a> <p class="caption-sm">Sublime Merge - Commit
   Dialog</p> </p> <p> You can download <a
   href="https://www.sublimemerge.com">Sublime Merge</a>, and try it for
   yourself - there's no time limit, no accounts, no metrics, and no
   tracking. The evaluation version is fully functional, but is restricted
   to the light theme only. Individual purchases are buy once, use
   forever, with 3 years of updates included in the purchase. Business
   licenses are available on a subscription basis. Sublime Merge runs on
   Windows, Mac and Linux. </p> <p> It's still early days for Sublime
   Merge - it has only been used by us and our small team of beta testers
   so far. We'd love to hear what you think. We'll be on the <a
   href="https://forum.sublimetext.com/">Forums</a> listening to any
   feedback - let us know how you get on with it! </p> <br> <p><small> *
   We have a custom implementation of Git for reading repositories, which
   drives a lot of our high performance functionality. However we defer to
   Git itself for operations that mutate the repository (Staging,
   Committing, Checking out branches, etc). </small></p> <script> if

   Oct 2017 06:00:00 +0000 Will Bond <p>With the release of Sublime Text
   3.0, we refreshed the visual design for the application, icon, and
   website. The new icon ties into the colors and shapes of the old, but
   is more abstract and fits well with other modern applications. The
   updated Default theme is still distinctly Sublime Text, but has full
   high DPI support, and works well with both dark and light color
   schemes. The three new color schemes take advantage of the work that
   has gone into modernizing and enhancing the syntax definitions included
   with Sublime Text.</p> <table style="margin: 20px 0;"> <tr> <th
   style="color: #777; font-style: italic; padding: 0 20px 12px 0;
   line-height: 1.2"> <b>Sublime Text 3 Build 3126</b><br> <span
   style="font-size: 0.9em">(Old) Default theme, IDLE color scheme</span>
   </th> <th style="color: #777; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2">
   <b>Sublime Text 3.0</b><br> <span style="font-size: 0.9em">(New)

   style="width: 250px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"> </td> </tr>
   </table> <p>As well as an overhaul of the default theme, we've also
   include a new theme, Adaptive, which uses the colors of your color
   scheme and applies variations of them to the side bar and various
   panels. The new color scheme setting <code>accent</code> is used to
   highlight selected options in the find panel, and to highlight modified
   tabs. Furthermore, on recent versions of macOS the title bar is also
   styled by the Adaptive theme to follow your selected color scheme.</p>
   <p>The result is a theme that acts as if it was custom designed for
   your color scheme. Check out this sample of Adaptive in action:</p>

   [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7]

   Use Multiple Selections to rename variables quickly Here Ctrl+DâŒ˜+D is
   used to select the next occurrence of the current word. Once created,
   each selection allows for full-featured editing.
   Quickly jump to files and functions with Goto Anything Here Ctrl+PâŒ˜+P
   is used to open the Goto Anything menu, xcc is used to select the file
   xla_compilation_cache.cc, @ switches to symbol mode, and :c selects the
   XlaCompilationCache::Compile method.
   Navigate source using Goto Definition Here the mouse is hovered over a
   symbol to jump to the definition. The keyboard shortcut F12 can be used
   when the caret is located on a symbol, or Goto Symbol in Project can be
   opened via Ctrl+Shift+Râ‡§+âŒ˜+R to jump to the definition of any symbol in
   the project.
   Unsurpassed performance Here a 7MB source code file is opened, and Goto
   Symbol Ctrl+RâŒ˜+R is used to jump to a function 200k lines down. Full
   editing features are retained for code in large files, or with complex
   syntax.

Some features our users love:

Goto Anything

   Use Goto Anything to open files with only a few keystrokes, and
   instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.

   Triggered with Ctrl+PâŒ˜+P, it is possible to:
     * Type part of a file name to open it.
     * Type @ to jump to symbols, # to search within the file, and : to go
       to a line number.

   These shortcuts can be combined, so tp@rf may take you to a function
   read_file within a file text_parser.py. Similarly, tp:100 would take
   you to line 100 of the same file.

Goto Definition

   Using information from syntax definitions, Sublime Text automatically
   generates a project-wide index of every class, method and function.
   This index powers Goto Definition, which is exposed in three different
   ways:
     * A popup is displayed when hovering over a symbol
     * Pressing F12 when the caret is on a symbol
     * The Goto Symbol in Project functionality

   Symbol indexing can be customized on a per-syntax basis via
   configuration files, allowing users to tailor the feature to their
   needs.

Multiple Selections

   Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple
   selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename
   variables with ease, and manipulate files faster than ever.

   Try pressing Ctrl+Shift+Lâ‡§+âŒ˜+L to split the selection into lines and
   Ctrl+DâŒ˜+D to select the next occurrence of the selected word. To make
   multiple selections with the mouse, take a look at the Column Selection
   documentation.

Command Palette

   The Command Palette holds infrequently used functionality, like
   sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation settings.
   With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you want, without
   ever having to navigate through the menus or remember obscure key
   bindings.

   Show the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+Pâ‡§+âŒ˜+P.

Powerful API and Package Ecosystem

   Sublime Text has a powerful, Python API that allows plugins to augment
   built-in functionality.

   Package Control can be installed via the command palette, providing
   simple access to thousands of packages built by the community.

Customize Anything

   Key bindings, menus, snippets, macros, completions and more - just
   about everything in Sublime Text is customizable with simple JSON
   files. This system gives you flexibility as settings can be specified
   on a per-file type and per-project basis.

Split Editing

   Get the most out of your wide screen monitor with split editing
   support. Edit files side by side, or edit two locations in the one
   file. You can edit with as many rows and columns as you wish. Take
   advantage of multiple monitors by editing with multiple windows, and
   using multiple splits in each window.

   Take a look at the View â–¶ Layout menu for split editing options. To
   open multiple views into the one file, use the File â–¶ New View into
   File menu item.

Instant Project Switch

   Projects in Sublime Text capture the full contents of the workspace,
   including modified and unsaved files. You can switch between projects
   in a manner similar to Goto Anything, and the switch is instant, with
   no save prompts - all your modifications will be restored next time the
   project is opened.

Performance

   Sublime Text is built from custom components, providing for unmatched
   responsiveness. From a powerful, custom cross-platform UI toolkit, to
   an unmatched syntax highlighting engine, Sublime Text sets the bar for
   performance.

Cross Platform

   Sublime Text is available for Mac, Windows and Linux. One license is
   all you need to use Sublime Text on every computer you own, no matter
   what operating system it uses.

   Sublime Text uses a custom UI toolkit, optimized for speed and beauty,
   while taking advantage of native functionality on each platform.
