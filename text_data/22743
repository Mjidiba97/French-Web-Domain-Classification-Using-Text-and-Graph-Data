Important note:

   The CentOS Project has nothing to do with this website or its content,
   it just provides the software that makes the website run.

   If you have issues with the content of this site, contact the owner of
   the domain, not the CentOS project. Unless you intended to visit
   CentOS.org, the CentOS Project does not have anything to do with this
   website, the content or the lack of it.

   For example, if this website is www.example.com, you would find the
   owner of the example.com domain at the following WHOIS server:

   http://www.internic.net/whois.html

The CentOS Project

   The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable and
   reproduceable platform derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise
   Linux (RHEL).

   Additionally to being a popular choice for web hosting, CentOS also
   provides a rich platform for open source communities to build upon. For
   more information please visit the CentOS website.
