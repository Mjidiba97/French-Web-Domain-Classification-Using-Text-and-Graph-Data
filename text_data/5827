   "Attend! I went last night and got the chance to meet with a few really
   interesting companies and got a few leads that may turn into
   interviews. At the very least I met a bunch of really interesting
   people in similar fields to my own to network with! The free food and
   drinks helps make the whole event very enjoyable."

   "The best part is meeting interesting new people that might have quite
   a lot in common, or not at all because they might be coming from a
   totally different technical area. Overall I would go again and
   recommend going."

   "I got hired in one of my dream company because of HackerX. So I would
   say it is definitely worth attending. I met great developers and had a
   great time I also noticed that they usually conduct the event after
   office hours. So it was definitely convenient for me to attend."

   I attended an event about a year ago, and I can honestly say it was an
   overall good experience. While you more than likely aren't going to get
   hired on the spot at one of these events, you will meet a decent amount
   of cool companies and possibly score a few interviews. I walked out of
   the event with three interviews set up for the following week and
   accepted an offer with one of those companies.

   I've only been to one in NYC, but it was the fastest and most efficient
   way to get some face time with lot of startups I was interested in
   working in. I actually got hired through it, and a handful of other
   contacts and interviews. Made my tiresome job search much less
   stressful.
   Kellye Greene

   The HackerX events are great! I have attended a couple of them and
   always meet with at least a few interesting companies. The last event I
   attended actually resulted in me getting hired by one of the attending
   companies. Definitely a good experience.
   Sean Patterson

   I was hired through a HackerX event, and I would recommend attending.
   It is a great opportunity to meet and mingle with a lot of companies
   that are looking to hire. There were about 20 companies there the night
   I attended. I found it to be a good opportunity to get a "foot in the
   door." I was also able to gauge my own interest in each company,
   without wasting my time going in for a formal interview. I lined up a
   few solid interviews for after the event. I ended up landing a job
   within a week of attending the event thanks to the conversations
   started that night. I would recommend you not pass up the opportunity
   if you are invited.

   Usually recruiting is a tortuous endeavor for both parties‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt
   actively looking for a job when I went to the HackerX event, but I
   found several opportunities on just an evening. I think you should
   attend, if only because its an opportunity to met many potential
   employees in a very short span of time.

   <p>See you soon!</p> <p><strong>TIPs:</strong></p> <ol><li>Bring
   business cards &#8211; Great for networking with others and since you
   only have 5 minutes to chat with a company you save time exchanging
   info. </li><li>Stay hydrated &#8211; Grab water before you start the
   rotations to ensure you have enough to last through the rotations.
   </li><li>Do research on the companies &#8211; Do research and make sure
   you read the agenda to save time. </li><li></li></ol> <p></p> <p> </p>

   <p><em>Sinuhe Tellez Rivera, Back-End Developer†<strong>¢</strong>
   Montreal, Canada </em></p> <p>Weôre bringing Developer Spotlights back!
   In this monthôs developer spotlight, we interviewed Sinuhe Tellez
   Rivera, a Back-End Developer who recently got hired at Mindgeek from
   our HackerX Montreal event back in July.</p> <p><strong>HackerX: How
   was your HackerX experience?</strong></p> <p><strong>Tellez</strong>:
   At the beginning, itôs normal to feel a little stressed because the
   format of HackerX is different. But after 2 companies, you start to
   relax, and by the 4th company, you find yourself actually enjoying it.
   It was still interesting to talk to people from companies about jobs
   that sometimes don&#8217;t suit you 100% but its still really
   interesting to hear about.</p> <p>My advice to others is: Invite your
   friends to HackerX, you never know when your friend could leave a
   positive reference to an employer. And a second tip- talk with the
   people around you while you are waiting in line to talk to companies.
   They are awesome developers and at the end they also have something
   interesting to share.</p> <p><strong>HackerX: What were you expecting
   from an event like ours and were your expectations met?</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Tellez:</strong> I was expecting to listen from companies
   about what they do in general.</p> <p><strong>HackerX: What was your
   main objectives of attending HackerX and did you achieve
   it?</strong></p> <p><strong>Tellez:</strong> I went to network and get
   contacts, so I can send my CV out to places, but instead, I met my
   future team there.</p> <p><strong>HackerX: Our concept turns the hiring
   and networking process on its head, and itôs a huge shift from the
   traditional method. Can you explain your understanding of HackerX in a
   tweet? (140 characters or less)</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Tellez:</strong> It&#8217;s like the analogic tinder, for
   job hunting.</p> <p><strong>HackerX: How did you feel, during the
   event, what did you learn from it, and how is it relevant to to your
   job search/ career, life in general?</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Tellez:</strong> I learned that you should not be shy and
   put yourself out there. Even if a company is looking for another kind
   of programmer, if you say what youôre looking for, you never know, maybe
   the hiring person knows someone who is looking for a programmer like
   you.</p> <p><img class="alignnone wp-image-99994365 aligncenter"

   numerous final stage interviews with HackerX candidates as well as
   multiple hires. The hires have been strong matches for our organization
   and we even uncovered some unknown rockstars in the process.</p> <p

   acquisition with HackerX is definitely very attractive.</p> <p><img

   graf-after--p">Easy, because I make hires from it and they are all
   quality hires. The cost of acquisition is low and at these events, you

   HQ in Berlin bustling with even more talent than usual, as we teamed up
   with HackerX to offer a recruiting event for the first time. We hosted
   over 60 prospective developers, engineers and data scientists for food,
   drinks and an introduction to glispaôs products, culture, and
   data-driven approach. Berlin already hosts a thriving tech scene, and
   for glispa, as an ad tech company, finding and hiring the right people
   to drive the companyôs technology forward is an essential part of our
   growth strategy. We already doubled our tech department in 2015 and are
   continuing to establish glispa as a leading employer in the technology
   space in Berlin.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"

   words from our CTO Philipp Neuberger and CPO Freddy Friedman, the
   attendees were given the opportunity to speak to members of glispaôs
   various engineering and data teams. By moving around different areas,
   they got the chance to speak formally with senior members of the
   different technology teams at glispa, and also informally with further
   members of other teams. In this way, they got to learn about the
   strategic direction glispaôs product offering is taking, how they could
   fit into the mix, and what everyday working life is like at glispa.</p>
   <p id="8cdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the end of the
   evening, some of the lucky attendees received raffle prizes such as
   drones, GoPros, Samsung Galaxy Tabs and Raspberry Pis. Weôre confident
   everyone went home with a positive impression of glispa as a great
   place to work and a leading player in ad tech.</p> <p id="4bcb"
