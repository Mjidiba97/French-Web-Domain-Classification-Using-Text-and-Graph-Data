   experiences to serve you better.

   This page will help you understand how your data is handled and how you
   can manage your privacy and consent preferences.

   The following will help you learn more about privacy at Tealium:
     * Privacy policy
     * Cookie policy

   Tealium has certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the
   Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. For more information on Tealium’s
   Privacy Shield compliance, please click here.

   Tealium will ask you to provide personal information about yourself to
   provide you services on the Tealium web sites. We are committed to
   keeping your personal information confidential and secure.  The purpose
   of this Privacy Policy is to tell you:
     * The personal information we request and why we ask for it
     * Who we share your personal information with
     * How we protect your personal information
     * How privacy laws apply
     * Who to contact if you have questions or issues about your privacy

Personal information we collect

    1. When you purchase Tealium’s services, we may ask you to provide
       billing information. We will also collect information on your IP
       address and browser type to allow you to use the services.
    2. When you request information from Tealium or use Tealium’s website,

With whom we share your data

       to some sort of legal process. If legally permitted, we will take
       commercially reasonable measures to inform you of such legal

How we protect your personal information?

   We take reasonable security measures, including physical,
   administrative, and technical safeguards to protect your personal
   information from loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration,
   destruction, and unavailability.

   How you can control Tealium’s access and use of your personal
   information

   There are two primary ways that you can control your personal
   information in Tealium –  disabling data collection and refining your
   data preferences. You can let us know that you would prefer not to be
   tracked by revoking consent on this page or by enabling the “Do Not

   our ability to understand how well our content resonates with our
   readers and customers. You can refine your data collection and privacy
   preferences by using our Privacy Manager, where you can decide what
   data is collected about you based on specific purposes.  For example,
   if you are happy to let us track how you use our website, as long as we
   do not use that for advertising purposes you can simply disable data
   collection for advertising purposes, while leaving analytics tracking
   on in our Privacy Manager.

   Tealium’s marketing emails contain instructions, including an
   “unsubscribe link” on how to opt out of receiving marketing emails from
   Tealium. You can also unsubscribe here.

   has about you. In addition, you can request that we (i) correct
   inaccurate or incomplete information we have about you, (ii) delete any
   personal information we have about you, (ii) restrict further
   processing of your personal information, (iv) transfer your personal
   information to the third party, and (v) opt-out or object to our use of
   personal information about you where our use if based on your consent
   or our legitimate interest. You can do this via our Data Subject Access
   Request page.
