   consumer data. This privacy policy also outlines how users can opt-out
   of data collection by Underdog Media. This policy also covers privacy
   practices and data collection on our marketing website (

   (https://underdogmedia.com/login/).

Privacy Practices

   or Non-Human Traffic (NHT).  As part of our efforts to identify this
   type of online fraud, Underdog Media will analyze Log Data for a period
   of 7 days, while our systems look for signatures of suspicious
   activity.  After the 7-day period Log Data is then deleted.  Some
   examples of Log Date include: the referring http location from the page
   our Underdog Media ad placement or technology was placed, the IP
   Address, browser type, operating system, and a timestamp of these
   related events.
