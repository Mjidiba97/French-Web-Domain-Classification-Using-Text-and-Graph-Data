   Selon une étude @LesEchos, ce sont déjà plus de 500 000 patients
   apnéiques qui sont télé-suivis ! (chiffre 2018) https://t.co/FxbqUehQTi

   Autre exemple avec Paul et son apnée du sommeil sévère récemment
   diagnostiquée. Certains moments sont clefs pour l’encourager à
   poursuivre son traitement. Grâce au #télésuivi et à notre connaissance
   de cette pathologie, nous ajustons notre accompagnement.

   Exemple👉Alex souffre d’insuffisance cardiaque chronique et vit seul
   dans la crainte d'une réhospitalisation. La #télémédecine et nos
   infirmiers ont pour objectif d'assurer son suivi, détecter les
   éventuels signes de complications et éviter la réhospitalisation

   Or, 50%* des patients chroniques ne suivent pas correctement leur
   traitement. Envie d’oublier la maladie, manque d’outils de suivi…
   plusieurs raisons nuisent à l’adhérence au traitement. (*OMS 2013)

   Chez lui, le patient souhaite préserver son autonomie et celle de son

   personnalisé du patient, adapté à son profil. https://t.co/7YKMKRWJSF

   Autre exemple avec Paul et son apnée du sommeil sévère récemment

   Exemple👉Alex souffre d’insuffisance cardiaque chronique et vit seul
   dans la crainte d'une réhospitalisation. La #télémédecine et nos
   infirmiers ont pour objectif d'assurer son suivi, détecter les

   Chez lui, le patient souhaite préserver son autonomie et celle de son
