Proposal for a new publishing model in Computer Science

   Many computer Science researchers are complaining that our emphasis on
   highly selective conference publications, and our double-blind
   reviewing system stifles innovation and slow the rate of progress of
   Science and technology.

   This pamphlet proposes a new publishing model based on an open
   repository and open (but anonymous) reviews which creates a "market"
   between papers and reviewing entities.

   Deep Learning

   Animals and humans can learn to see, perceive, act, and communicate
   with an efficiency that no Machine Learning method can approach. The
   brains of humans and animals are "deep", in the sense that each action
   is the result of a long chain of synaptic communications (many layers
   of processing). We are currently researching efficient learning
   algorithms for such "deep architectures". We are currently
   concentrating on unsupervised learning algorithms that can be used to
   produce deep hierarchies of features for visual recognition. We surmise
   that understanding deep learning will not only enable us to build more
   intelligent machines, but will also help us understand human
   intelligence and the mechanisms of human learning.

   Relational Regression

   We are developing a new type of relational graphical models that can be
   applied to "structured regression problem". A prime example of
   structured regression problem is the prediction of house prices. The
   price of a house depends not only on the characteristics of the house,
   but also of the prices of similar houses in the neighborhood, or
   perhaps on hidden features of the neighborhood that influence them. Our
   relational regression model infers a hidden "desirability sruface" from
   which house prices are predicted.

   Mobile Robotics

   The purpose of the LAGR project, funded by the US government, is to
   design vision and learning algorithms to allow mobile robots to
   navigate in complex outdoors environment solely from camera input.

   My Lab, collaboration with Net-Scale Technologies is one of 8
   participants in the program (Applied Perception Inc., Georgia Tech,
   JPL, NIST, NYU/Net-Scale, SRI, U. Penn, Stanford).

   Each LAGR team received identical copies of the LAGR robot, built be
   the CMU/NREC.

   [lagr-vehicle-small.jpg]
   The government periodically runs competitions between the teams. The
   software from each team is loaded and run by the goverment team on
   their robot.

   The robot is given the GPS coordinates of a goal to which it must drive
   as fast as possible. The terrain is unknown in advance. The robot is
   run three times through the test course.

   The software can use the knowledge acquired during the early runs to
   improve the performance on the latter runs.

   [lagr-stereo.png]

   Prior to the LAGR project, we worked on the DAVE project, an attempt to
   train a small mobile robot to drive autonomously in off-road
   environments by looking over the shoulder of a human operator.

   Energy-Based Models

   Energy-Based Models (EBMs) capture dependencies between variables by
   associating a scalar energy to each configuration of the variables.
   Inference consists in clamping the value of observed variables and
   finding configurations of the remaining variables that minimize the
   energy. Learning consists in finding an energy function in which
   observed configurations of the variables are given lower energies than
   unobserved ones. The EBM approach provides a common theoretical
   framework for many learning models, including traditional
   discriminative and generative approaches, as well as graph-transformer
   networks, conditional random fields, maximum margin Markov networks,
   and several manifold learning methods.

   Probabilistic models must be properly normalized, which sometimes
   requires evaluating intractable integrals over the space of all
   possible variable configurations. Since EBMs have no requirement for
   proper normalization, this problem is naturally circumvented. EBMs can
   be viewed as a form of non-probabilistic factor graphs, and they
   provide considerably more flexibility in the design of architectures
   and training criteria than probabilistic approaches.

   Invariant Object Recognition

   Lenet7-NORB NORB

   The recognition of generic object categories with invariance to pose,
   lighting, diverse backgrounds, and the presence of clutter is one of
   the major challenges of Computer Vision.

   I am developing learning systems that can recognize generic object
   purely from their shape, independently of pose and lighting.

   See

   The NORB dataset for generic object recognition is available for
   download.

   Lush: A Programming Language for Research

   Tired of Matlab? Lush is an easy-to-learn, open-source object-oriented
   programming language designed for researchers, experimenters, and
   engineers working in large-scale numerical and graphic applications.

   Lush combines three languages in one: a very simple to use,
   loosely-typed interpreted language, a strongly-typed compiled language
   with the same syntax, and the C language, which can be freely mixed
   with the other languages within a single source file, and even within a
   single function.

   [lush-logo-03-138x102.png] Lush has a library of over 14,000 functions
   and classes, some of which are simple interfaces to popular libraries:
   vector/matrix/tensor algebra, linear algebra (LAPACK, BLAS), numerical
   function (GSL), 2D and 3D graphics (X, SDL, OpenGL, OpenRM, PostScipt),
   image processing, computer vision (OpenCV), machine learning
   (gblearning, Torch), regular expressions, audio processing (ALSA), and
   video grabbing (Video4linux).

   If you do research and development in signal processing, image
   processing, machine learning, computer vision, bio-informatics, data
   mining, statistics, or artificial intelligence, and feel limited by
   Matlab and other existing tools, Lush is for you. If you want a simple
   environment to experiment with graphics, video, and sound, Lush is for
   you. Lush is Free Software (GPL) and runs under GNU/Linux, Solaris, and
   Irix.

   DjVu: The Document Format for Digital Libraries

   [djvu_badge-140x49.gif] [pharm-thumb.jpeg] My main research topic until
   I left AT&T was the DjVu project. DjVu is a document format, a set of
   compression methods and a software platform for distributing scanned
   and digitally produced documents on the Web. DjVu image files of
   scanned documents are typically 3-8 times smaller than PDF or
   TIFF-groupIV for bitonal and 5-10 times smaller than PDF or JPEG for
   color (at 300 DPI). DjVu versions of digitally produced documents are
   more compact and render much faster than the PDF or PostScript
   versions.

   Hundreds of websites around the world are using DjVu for Web-based and
   CDROM-based document repositories and digital libraries.

   Learning and Visual Perception

   [a23-small.gif] My main research interest is machine learning,
   particularly how it applies to perception, and more particularly to
   visual perception.

   I am currently working on two architectures for gradient-based
   perceptual learning: graph transformer networks and convolutional
   networks.

   Convolutional Nets are a special kind of neural net architecture
   designed to recognize images directly from pixel data. Convolutional
   Nets can be trained to detect, segment and recognize objects with
   excellent robustness to noise, and variations of position, scale,
   angle, and shape.

   Have a look at the animated demonstrations of LeNet-5, a Convolutional
   Nets trained to recognize handwritten digit strings.

   Convolutional nets and graph transformer networks are embedded in
   several high speed scanners used by banks to read checks. A system I
   helped develop reads an estimated 10 percent of all the checks written
   in the US.

   Check out this page, and/or read this paper to learn more about
   Convolutional Nets and graph transformer networks.

   MNIST Handwritten Digit Database

   The MNIST database contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test
   samples of size-normalized handwritten digits. This database was
   derived from the original NIST databases.

   MNIST is widely used by researchers as a benchmark for testing pattern
   recognition methods, and by students for class projects in pattern
   recognition, machine learning, and statistics.

   Music and Hobbies

   I have several interests beside my family (my wife and three sons) and
   my research:
     * Playing Music: particularly Jazz, Renaissance and Baroque music. A
       few MP3 and MIDI files of Renaissance music are available here.
     * Building and flying miniature flying contraptions: preferably
       battery powered, radio controled, and unconventional in their
       design. [plane01-thumb.jpg]
     * Building robots: particularly Lego robots (before the days of the
       Lego Mindstorms)
     * Hacking various computing equipment: I have owned 5 computers
       between 1978 and 1992: SYM-1, OSI C2-4P, Commodore 64, Amiga 1000,
       Amiga 4000. then I lost interest in personal computing when the
       only thing you could get was a boring Wintel box. Then, Linux
       appeared and I came back to life.....
     * Sailing: I own two sport catamarans, a Nacra 5.8 and a Prindle 19.
       I also sail and race larger boats with friends.
     * Graphic Design: I designed the DjVu logo and much of the AT&T DjVu
       web site.
     * Reading European comics. Comics in certain European countries
       (France, Belgium, Italy, Spain) are considered a true art form ("le
       8-ieme art"), and not just a business with products targeted at
       teenagers like on this side of the pond. Although I don't have a
       shred of evidence to support it, I claim to have the largest
       private collection of French-language comics in the Eastern US.
     * making bad puns in French, but I don't have much of an audience
       this side of the pond.
     * Sipping wine, particularly red, particularly French, particularly
       Bordeaux, particularly Saint-Julien.

       prize winner tried to tell me how to pronounce my own name.

   Previous Life

   My former group at AT&T (the Image Processing Research Department) and
   its ancestor (Larry Jackel's Adaptive Systems Research Department) made
   numerous contributions to Machine Learning, Image Compression, Pattern
   Recognition, Synthetic Persons (talking heads), and Neural-Net
   Hardware. Specific contributions not mentioned elsewhere on this site
   include the ever so popular Support Vector Machine, the PlayMail and
   Virt2Elle synthetic talking heads, the Net32K and ANNA neural net
   chips, and many others. Visit my former group's home page for more
