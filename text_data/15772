Webmail Increases to 29% for November Email Client Market Share

   [ 0 By Kayla Voigt

   Every month, we track opens from more than 1 billion emails using
   Litmus‚Äô Email Analytics and share the trends we observe in various
   email clients and environments. In November, webmail market share grew
   to 29%, while mobile and desktop dropped to 55% and 16%, respectively.
   nov16emailmarketshare.001

A REFRESHER ON MARKET SHARE TERMS + EMAIL OPENS

     * ‚ÄúMobile‚Äù refers not only to mobile-specific email clients, like
       iPhone or Android, but also where users are opening their email. If
       they‚Äôre using the Yahoo Mail app on their iPhone, for example, that
       counts as a mobile open for iPhone. This also includes tablets like
       the iPad.
     * ‚ÄúDesktop‚Äù shows any email client opened on a desktop application.
       That means any email client that required you to install software.
       If you‚Äôre using a Mac, for instance, that could mean Apple Mail. On
       a PC, that might be Outlook.
     * ‚ÄúWebmail,‚Äù by contrast, means you‚Äôre using an email client within a
       browser. Logging onto your Gmail account or using Outlook.com fall
       under the ‚Äúwebmail‚Äù category.

   How do we track opens? Open tracking in Litmus Email Analytics is based
   on 1√ó1 invisible pixel image tracking, which is the same technique that
   your email service provider uses to report your
   open rate. When a customer opens your email, the image is loaded. This
   counts as an open. (Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthe tracking pixel doesn‚Äôt alter your
   carefully planned designs!)

   Let‚Äôs dig into the data:

Top 10 Email Clients

   Apple iPhone holds the top spot with 33.69% of all opens, with Gmail
   coming in a distant second at 15.96%.

iPad Growth Holds, Android Drops for Mobile

   nov16emailmarketshare.002

   While mobile dropped to 55%, it may be a regular fluctuation. Mobile
   market share oscillated between 56% and 55% share since July 2016.
   However, the drop was a surprise since Black Friday mobile sales broke
   records this month. Since many major retailers offered special
   mobile-only deals, it may be that those deals were promoted in-app,
   instead of via email. Either way, Black Friday mobile sales topped $1
   billion‚Äîmobile is still king.

   Last month‚Äôs trends continue this month, with Apple iPad holding at
   12.4%, its highest point since February 2015. Before last month, iPad
   hadn‚Äôt been above 12% since January 2016. This growth may signal that
   iPad users may be replacing their laptop or desktop with an iPad, at
   least for email.

   Android continues to drop, down to 8.56% total opens, almost a 1%
   decrease since last month (when Android also dropped 1%).

   This drop may be due to users switching ship from Android‚Äôs native
   email app to Gmail. Recent changes like the ‚ÄúGmailify‚Äù feature that
   allows users to obtain an email address without ‚Äú@gmail.com‚Äù may appeal
   to Android‚Äôs user base. In addition, Gmail now supports responsive
   design‚Äîholdouts turned off by a poor user experience from
   non-responsive emails in the past may now be switching.

Desktop Drops to 16%

   nov16emailmarketshare.003

   Desktop opens dropped to 16% this month, its lowest ever. Desktop has
   been trending downwards since May 2016 and we may see additional drops
   as mobile and webmail become the choice for email users.

   Outlook remains in the top 10 at 6.05% of market share despite dropping
   steadily since August 2016. And while Outlook may account for a low
   overall percentage of email client market share, it‚Äôs important to know
   what percentage of your audience is opening there‚Äîespecially because
   Outlook can give email geeks headaches.

   Here are a few things to be aware of when coding emails for Outlook:
     * To properly structure your emails for maximum
       cross-device/client/browser render-ability, you‚Äôll need to use
       tables.
     * Outlook doesn‚Äôt support animated GIFs‚Äîit will only show the first
       frame.
     * To make background images work, Outlook requires the use of VML
     * Outlook has no padding support on p, div, and a tags

   There is hope, email geeks. We‚Äôve partnered with Microsoft to
   prioritize email rendering bugs in Outlook, identify issues faster, and
   announce improvements and fixes to the community. You can submit
   Outlook bugs here.

Webmail Opens Grow to 29%

   nov16emailmarketshare.004

   The main driver of webmail growth? Gmail.

   Gmail remains the most popular webmail client by far, jumping up from
   15% to 17% this month. While Gmail has been notoriously difficult to
   design and develop for, there‚Äôs hope! The Gmail team recently rolled
   out support responsive design, improved font styling, and CSS for
   accessibility.

   We‚Äôre following this closely on our Gmail live ticker as changes
   continue to roll out this quarter. While that may take some time, this
   month saw the rollout finally hit the Gmail iOS app. All Gmail mobile
   apps now support responsive email. G Suite accounts show the rendering
   update as well.

   If there was ever a time to go for responsive design, it‚Äôs now! We
   define responsive design as using fluid tables, fluid images, and media
   queries to control the layout of an email across different device
   sizes. Get started with our how-to guide.

WHERE DID WE GET ALL THIS DATA?

   This data is derived from over 1 billion opens collected worldwide with
   Litmus Email Analytics between November 1, 2016 and November 30, 2016.
   It highlights worldwide trends across all industries and verticals.
   Some email clients may be over- or under-represented due to image
   blocking. Tracking trends over time is the best way to monitor open
   data for email!

WHICH EMAIL CLIENTS ARE MOST POPULAR WITH YOUR AUDIENCE?

   While general email client open data is great for looking at trends,
   it‚Äôs your audience that matters. With the addition of a small tracking
   code to your campaigns, Litmus Email Analytics generates a report of
   where your subscribers open your emails. Use that data to focus your
   testing efforts‚Äîand ensure your campaigns look great in inboxes where
   your subscribers are opening.

   Analyticsîin this post.</p> <p>If youôre using Google Analytics, you can
   track your subscribersô post-click activities by adding UTM codes to the
   end of the URLs in your email. Also known as UTM parameters, UTM codes
   are bits of text added to the end of your URL to help you track user
   behavior on your website.</p> <p>If youôve ever been to a website, or
   hovered over a text link, and noticed a URL like the one below,
   it&#8217;s likely because UTM codes are being used.</p>
   <pre><code>https://litmus.com/email-builder?utm_campaign=tracking_manag
   er_launch&#038;utm_source=pardot&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;utm_content
   =image1</code></pre> <p>In the example above, youôll see the website
   address (<strong>https://litmus.com/email-builder</strong>), and then a
   snippet of text after the question mark. The snippet of text following
   the website address are the UTM codes.</p> <p>Adding UTM codes to your
   links wonôt break your links. Instead, they give you access to data that
   goes beyond the opens and clicks provided by your ESP. </p> <p>Each
   portion of the UTM code tracks a different aspect of the traffic on
   your website:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Campaign Name</strong>
   <em><strong>(utm_campaign=tracking_manager_launch)</strong></em>: Use
   this to identify a specific product promotion or campaign. In the
   example above, the campaign is útracking_managerù which means the focus
   of the email campaign was the <a
   href="https://litmus.com/help/testing/litmus-builder-guide?utm_campaign
   =tracking_manager&#038;utm_source=litmusblog&#038;utm_medium=blog#track
   ing-manager">Tracking Manager</a> launch.</li> <li><strong>Campaign
   Source</strong> <em><strong>(utm_source=pardot)</strong></em>: The
   campaign source should cover where your traffic is coming to the site
   from. In the example above, the email was sent via Pardot so that is
   the source. If your content was shared via Twitter, for instance, you
   would use &#8220;twitter&#8221; as your source.</li>
   <li><strong>Campaign Medium</strong>
   <em><strong>(utm_medium=email)</strong></em>: Use the campaign medium
   to take a high-level look at your marketing efforts. In the example
   above, the medium is simply úemail.ù Youôll be able to track all of your
   general email marketing efforts, but then can drill down into the
   source and name to get detailed data on specific campaigns.</li>
   <li><strong>Campaign Content</strong>
   <em><strong>(utm_content=image1)</strong></em>: While not a required
   UTM code, campaign content is a great way to dig deeper into your data.
   You can use them to specify text links, CTA buttons, and even linked
   images to see which types of CTAs generate not only the most clicks
   (you can see that in your ESPôs data), but what types of CTAs encourage
   the most post-click activities.</li> </ul> <p>The use of these UTM code
   elements varies based on how you want your information displayed in
   Google Analytics. In the example above, we have the medium as the
   highest level of organization, followed by source, name, and content.
   How you organize yours is up to you!</p>
   <p><em><strong>Note</strong></em><em>: UTM codes are case sensitive!
   So, úPardotù and úpardotù would both be separated in Google Analytics
   reports. Be consistent when it comes to capitalization to avoid any
   confusions.</em></p> <h3>Creating UTM codes</h3> <p>There are numerous
   ways to create UTM codes: using Googleôs URL builder tool, manually
   writing them, or using an internal customized tool. </p> <h4>Google URL
   builder</h4> <p>Google has a <a
   href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867">free
   tool</a> for creating URLs with UTM codes on them. You plug in your
   URL, and the numerous UTM codes and a link will be generated for
   you.</p> <h4>Manually writing them</h4> <p>While time consuming, itôs
   possible to manually add UTM codes to each of your URLs once youôve
   memorized the formula. However, creating them yourself definitely
   leaves room for error.</p> <h4>Internal tool</h4> <p>Keeping track of
   UTM codes can be a bit unwieldy depending on how many campaigns youôre
   running. If you have an awesome dev team (we definitely do!), then you
   can create a tool of your own to manage your UTM creation.</p> <figure
   id="post-12001 media-12001" class="alignnone"><img class=""
   src="https://d31v04zdn5vmni.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016
   /03/utm-tool.png" alt="UTM tool - post-click tracking" /></figure>
   <p>While time consuming from a dev perspective, this internal tool has
   been a great way for us to create and organize our UTM codes.</p>
   <h3>Adding UTM codes to your campaigns</h3> <p>So what do you do after
   you have your UTM codes for a campaign? Itôs time to add them to the
   links in your campaign. </p> <h4>Manually adding them</h4> <p>You can
   manually add your UTM codes at the end of every link in your campaign.
   Simply search your email for URLs linking to your site, and add the
   codes to the end of the URLs. </p> <p>While this is definitely an
   option, itôs time consuming, and leaves room for errors, such as missing
   links.</p> <h4>Some Email service providers can do it for you</h4>
   <p>Many ESPs support automated link tracking. For example, <a
   href="http://help.campaignmonitor.com/topic.aspx?t=111&#038;_ga=1.78721
   620.1733968664.1396275600">Campaign Monitor has a Google Analytics
   integration</a>. Once users link their accounts together, they enter
   the domains they want to track (ie. ours would be litmus.com), as well
   as the campaign source. </p> <p>Campaign names are automatically pulled
   from the name of the campaign in Campaign Monitor, and the medium is
   set to email. Neither of these aspects can be edited by the user. The
   UTM codes are then added to every link on the domain(s) selected during
   the integration. </p> <p>While automated link tracking by ESPs is a big
   time saver, you donôt have the flexibility to edit campaign names to
   your preference. </p> <h4>Tracking Manager in Litmus Builder</h4>
   <p>With Tracking Manager in Litmus Builder, adding tracking codes to
   links in your email has never been quicker or easier. </p> <p>Say
   goodbye to the hassle of copying your tracking code, endlessly
   scrolling or searching for every single link the email, and pasting the
   tracking code to each link. And now you can customize your UTM codes to
   suit your tracking preferences.</p> <p>Simply input your tracking code,
   and select which links in the email youôd like to apply it to. </p>

   doubling the number of people behind the magic with 24 new
   employees.</p> <p>With that, weôve added talent from all corners of the
   globe. Our úremote firstù culture allows us to be humans first and
   employees second. We get to watch our kids act in school plays, go for
   a quick run, refrain from putting on pants in the morning if we want
   to, or indulge our wanderlust, as long as we get our jobs done. And
   though thatôs awesome, thereôs no substitute for face-to-face
   bonding.</p> <p>úI love that weôre remote first,ù says Paul Farnell,
   Co-founder and CEO of Litmus. úItôs opened us up to talent we never would
   have seen otherwise. Staying connectedîwhether thatôs through Slack,
   video conferencing, or frequent callsîis one of our challenges, and I
   think weôve all really embraced that challenge.ù</p> <p>We just spent
   some time coming together as a team at our annual company retreatîfrom
   as far away as Pakistan and Ecuadorîto reconnect, recharge, and
   ultimately re-inspire ourselves and our teammates. We whiteboarded,
   presented, chatted, and skied together to remind ourselves who we are
   and what matters most to us. </p> <blockquote><p> úEverything we do is
   as a team. Weôre always seeking to improve ourselves and celebrate the
   accomplishments as a group effort. Our semi-annual company-wide meetups
   are my favorite way we do that.ù &#8211;Paul Farnell </p></blockquote>

   <p>Apple iPhone and iPad represent 44.6% of total opens, and 80.8% of
   mobile opens. This is good news for email designers since iOS has great
   support for HTML and CSS. If youôre seeing a large percentage of your
   audience opening in these clients, try using modern techniques like <a

   038;utm_medium=blog">HTML5 video and CSS3 animation</a> to see if it
   increases engagement.</p> <p>Since January, iPhone opens increased
   4.1%, while iPad opens decreased 4.1%. iPad opens have been on a
   continual decline over the past year and have decreased 4.9% since
   March 2015. </p> <p>Itôs probably no coincidence that the iPadôs slump to
   11.6% of opens has accompanied a <a

   lts-how-many-iphones-ipads-watch-macs-sold-revenue-results-3581769/">do
   wnturn in tablet sales</a>. As of Q4 2014, Apple had sold 12.3 million
   iPads, while Q4 2015 gures report sales of 9.8 millionîa 20% drop. </p>
   <h3>DIGGING INTO DESKTOP OPENS</h3> <figure id="post-11919 media-11919"
   class="alignnone"><img class=""
   src="https://d31v04zdn5vmni.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016
   /03/desktop-opens-chart1.png" alt="Desktop opens" /></figure> <p>While
   Outlook opens have remained relatively stagnant since January, theyôve
   taken a major hit since last year. Outlook opens have decreased a
   whopping 27.2% since March 2015. This decrease is likely a result of
   business shifting away from expensive desktop suites, and moving to
   scalable services, like Gmail Apps. </p> <p>However, Outlook opens
   still represent 6.7% of market share, so it shouldnôt be discounted.
   Digging into Outlook stats, hereôs a breakdown of which versions
   subscribers are using:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Outlook 2000-2003</strong>:
   15%</li> <li><strong>Outlook 2007</strong>: 16%</li>
   <li><strong>Outlook 2010</strong>: 35%</li> <li><strong>Outlook
   2013</strong>: 27%</li> <li><strong>Outlook 2016</strong>: 7%</li>
   </ul> <p>Unfortunately for email designers, these later versions of
   Outlook use Microsoft Word to render emails. <a
   href="https://litmus.com/blog/a-guide-to-rendering-differences-in-micro
   soft-outlook-clients?utm_campaign=marketshare_feb16&#038;utm_source=lit
   musblog&#038;utm_medium=blog">HTML and CSS support</a> in Outlook 2007+
   is less than ideal. </p> <p>Hereôs just some of what email designers are
   up against:</p> <ul> <li>No support for background images in divs and
   table cells</li> <li>No support for CSS float or position</li> <li>No
   support for text shadow</li> <li>Poor support for padding and
   margin</li> <li>Poor support for CSS width and height</li> <li>Problems
   with nested elements background colors</li> </ul> <p>If youôre seeing a
   large percentage of your audience opening in later Outlook clients,
   then definitely keep these quirks in mind.</p> <h3>DIGGING INTO WEBMAIL
   OPENS</h3> <figure id="post-11916 media-11916" class="alignnone"><img

   src="https://d31v04zdn5vmni.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016
   /03/webmail-opens-chart1.png" alt="Webmail opens" /></figure>
   <p>Webmail opens have remained relatively unchanged since last month,
   but have seen major changes since this time last year. Since March
   2015, Gmail opens decreased 11.7% and Outlook.com opens decreased
   53.3%.</p> <p>The fall in Gmail opens and subsequent rise of iPhone and
   Android opens may suggest users of the Gmail app are switching back to
   the native email apps on these phones. The Gmail app for iOS and
   Android continually frustrate users with their <a

   e=litmusblog&#038;utm_medium=blog">notoriously poor support for
   responsive design</a>.</p> <p>The drastic drop in Outlook.com opens can
   be attributed to <a

   early February. </p> <h4>Where did we get all this data?</h4> <p>This
   data is derived from over 13 billion opens collected worldwide with <a

   https://litmus.com/blog/?p=11887 <p>While opens and clicks are a great
   way to measure overall engagement, they don't paint the whole picture
   of a campaign's performance. Our award-winning campaign didn't have
   high opens or clicks, but it did accomplish its goal of creating
   awareness and generating buzz around The Email Design Conference. </p>

   interaction with your subscribers counts. Send emails that your
   subscribers want, that are relevant to their needs and interests, that
   excite them, and (most importantly!) that make them want to take
   action. </p> <p>Campaigns that accomplish all the above not only win
   the hearts and minds of your customers, they&#8217;re a win for your
   business. And we&#8217;re particularly proud of one campaign in
   particular that also won an award: the <a
   href="https://emailexperience.org/events/dma-email-experience-councils-
   email-marketing-awards/2016-eec-award-winners/">2016 EEC Email
   Marketing Program Award</a> for úBest or Most Innovative Integration
   with Another Channel.ù</p> <p>That campaign was our save the date email
   for TEDC15 (The Email Design Conference).</p> <p>What surprised us?
   This campaign wasnôt a success because it had the most opens or clicks.
   In fact, it had much lower open and click rates compared to our other
   emails. </p> <p>However, opens and clicks wasnôt our goal. The main
   call-to-action in the campaign asked our readers to tweetîand, boy, did
   we get a lot of tweets! It excelled at its stated goals of driving
   awareness and creating buzz around the conference, and weôre humbled and
   grateful to have won an award in recognition of those efforts! </p>
   <h2>A look at the campaign</h2> <h3>The goals</h3> <p>After <a
   href="https://litmus.com/blog/how-to-code-html5-video-background-in-ema
   il?utm_campaign=inspiration_eecaward&#038;utm_source=litmusblog&#038;ut
   m_medium=blog">embedding a video background</a> into TEDC14ôs úsave the
   date,ù we had set high expectations with the community for a follow-up
   in 2015. As such, the primary goal of the campaign was to surprise,
   delight, and inspire our audience with a creative use of email,
   preferably leveraging a technique that is rarely seen or thought to be
   unsupported in email. </p> <p>By utilizing innovative techniques in
   event-related emails, we wanted to demonstrate thought leadership and
   prove to our subscribers that we have the expertise and skills to teach
   others at TEDC. Additional goals were to raise awareness and excitement
   about the event, drive social mentions, and create anticipation for
   future ticket sales. </p> <h3>The email</h3> <p>After many
   brainstorming sessions, we opted to announce dates and generate
   excitement for TEDC15 by embedding an <a
   href="https://litmus.com/blog/how-to-code-a-live-dynamic-twitter-feed-i

   results</a> to see how it displayed in 40+ email clients.</em> </p>
   <p>úSave the dateù emails were sent to Litmus subscribers and past
   attendees. Each contained a live dynamic Twitter feed featuring tweets
   using the #TEDC15 hashtag. As recipients opened the email, live tweets
   appeared within the email. Subscribers tweeted using the hashtag, then
   returned to the email to see their own message appear live in the
   stream <em>inside</em> the email.</p> <h2>Measuring success: What
   metrics matter?</h2> <p>The campaign garnered widespread attention,
   resulting in 5,000 new visitors to the Litmus website, 1,000 new
   prospects, and 750 tweets containing the event hashtagîall within 24
   hours. </p> <p>To date, itôs garnered nearly 1,260 forwards and 350
   prints. More than 60% of the people that opened the email spent 18 or
   more seconds reading the message, the highest duration of engagement of
   any email weôve ever sent. </p> <p>When we launched ticket sales a few
   weeks later, early bird tickets sold out in 10 minutes for the Boston
   event and 48 hours for the London event.</p> <p>Despite being sent
   nearly a year ago, the campaign continues to drive additional email and
   social engagement as users re-visit the email and contribute to the
   Twitter stream. </p> <p>The goal of this campaign went beyond opens and
   clicks to draw the email community together and create awareness for
   the event. Between hundreds of tweets, dozens of forwards and prints,
   and early bird tickets selling in minutes, it exceeded every
   expectation.</p> <h2>Whatôs your most successful campaign? </h2> <p>Many
   marketers focus on open and click rates. While those metrics can be a
   great way to measure overall engagement, they donôt paint the whole
   picture of a campaignôs performance, especially when different emails
   have different goals. </p> <p>What has been your most successful
   campaign? How did you measure its success? </p> <p><a

   <p>With the passing of Ray Tomlinson, the inventor of modern email and
   the @ symbol, weôd like to thank him for creating our favorite
   communication medium and reflect on how itôs evolved over the past 45
   years. </p> <p>Prior to 1971, email existed in a limited format. Users
   could only share messages between people on the same limited network.
   However, in 1971, Tomlinson, who worked in Boston at Bolt, Beranek, and
   Newman, took it to the next level. He conceived the method of sending
   messages across a network, and introduced the @ symbol to allow
   messages to be targeted at certain users on certain machines. It was
   the start of 1:1 personal emails.</p> <p>Due to the scarcityîand high
   costîof computers at the time, very few people had personal computers,
   so the popularity of email as we know it today didnôt take off until
   years later. It wasnôt until personal computers became more commonplace
   and online services boomed in the late 1980s and early 1990s that email
   became more conventional.</p> <p>Email evolved into both a personal and
   business mediumîwhich is exactly what Tomlinson predicted. In a 2012
   interview with <a
   href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/2/2991486/ray-tomlinson-email-inve
   ntor-interview-i-see-email-being-used">The Verge</a>, Tomlinson said, úI
   see email being used, by and large, exactly the way I envisioned. In
   particular, itôs not strictly a work tool or strictly a personal thing.
   Everybody uses it in different ways, but they use it in a way they find
   works for them.ù</p> <p>And itôs continued to evolveîand grow in
   popularityîevery year since its inception.</p> <h2>The current state of
   email</h2> <p>Today, there are over 205 billion emails sent each day,
   and over 2.6 billion email users. And, these numbers are expected to
   exponentially increase. The <a
   href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Email-Stati
   stics-Report-2015-2019-Executive-Summary.pdf">Radicati Group</a>
   predicts there will be over 246.5 billion emails sent each day and 2.9
   billion email users by 2019. </p> <p>There are now dozens upon dozens
   of different email clients and apps available. Users can choose between
   a variety of desktop, webmail, and mobile clientsîand even wearables
   like the Apple Watchîto read and send their email. Over time, the
   popularity of reading on mobile and tablets has increased. Today, over

   where-subscribers-read-email-infographic?utm_campaign=industry_tomlinso
   n&#038;utm_source=litmusblog&#038;utm_medium=blog">55%</a> of emails
   are opened in those environments. </p> <p>Email has become one of the
   most powerful channels to reach consumers. With ROI of <a
   href="http://cdn.emailmonday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/National-cl
   ient-email-2015-DMA.pdf">38-to-1</a>, it has the highest rate of return
   among digital marketing channels. And people want to receive emails,
   with <a
   href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/customer-communicati
   on-by-channel#">72%</a> of consumers saying they prefer companies to
   communicate with them via email over any other channel. </p> <p>Every
   year, we push the limits of what&#8217;s possible in email. Emails are
   no longer solely text-based. With the use of HTML and CSS, they can
   have colors, buttons, images, and more. </p> <p>Emails are now
   segmented based on subscriber preferences or activities, and can
   include dynamic content to create a personalized experience. </p>
   <p>More recently, email designers have begun using techniques commonly
   found in advanced web design, like <a

   <p>Think of the innovations that have impacted email marketing
   professionals in the past 5 yearsîthings like mobile devices becoming
   the dominant email-reading platform, the debut of the Apple Watch, the
   firm establishment of engagement-based email filtering by ISPs, the
   cross-channel integration of email marketing, and the emergence of
   interactive email functionality like email carrousels and hamburger
   menus.</p> <p>Considering all of that change, we couldnôt help but
   wonder: What do the next 5 years have in store?</p> <p>For our <a

   og&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_campaign=email2020&#038;utm_content=to
   plink">Email Marketing in 2020</a> report, we asked 20 experts to
   tackle this question. Their answers augur dramatic changes in
   personalization, automation, interactivity, compliance, and much
   more.</p> <p>We asked this same question of six of our speakers at <a
   target="_blank"
   href="https://litmus.com/conference?utm_source=litmusblog&#038;utm_medi
   um=blog&#038;utm_campaign=email2020">The Email Design Conference</a>.
   Their answers focused on email production workflow, coding support, the
   subscriber experience, and interactive elements.</p> <p>You can watch
   the full interview here, or read a transcript of it below.</p>
   <p><script charset="ISO-8859-1"
   src="//fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script> <div
   class="wistia_embed wistia_async_ynzparh3zi"
   style="height:293px;width:520px">&nbsp;</div> <h2>Brian Graves, UI Team
   Lead, DEG</h2> <p>In 2020, the subscriber experience in my mind will
   really be a lot more interactive in nature. So, all these new CSS
   elements and things we can do there are going to kind of be mainstream
   at that point in my mind. We&#8217;re going to move past some of these
   limitations of older clients like Outlook and hopefully by then Outlook
   and Gmail have moved on as well and we&#8217;ll have much more advanced
   things we can do in the inbox.</p> <h2>Fabio Carneiro, Lead Email
   Developer &#038; UX Designer, MailChimp</h2> <p>So in five years I
   think the subscriber experience willîit will probably get messier before
   it gets better. You know, there&#8217;s a lot of push right now forîas
   all these exciting technologies become more and more available to email
   designersîthere is certainly this rush to try to use everything you can
   without necessarily stopping to think about whether or not you should.
   So we&#8217;re going to be fighting a lot of that certainly over the
   next five yearsîI mean, definitely over the next year, just given how
   fast we move.</p> <h2>Lee Munroe, Product Design Lead, Mailgun by
   Rackspace</h2> <p>We&#8217;re going to see a lot more front-end web
   development coming into email. We&#8217;ve seen responsive design
   obviously come in to email. We&#8217;re going to see a lot more
   eventually come over to email as the clients catch up, hopefully. Maybe
   we&#8217;ll even see email standards at some point. Fingers
   crossed.</p> <h2>Mark Robbins, Email Developer, Rebelmail</h2> <p>In
   2020, there&#8217;s still going to be some sort of overflow from the
   old things. People will still be using older versions of Outlook.
   We&#8217;re still going to have to work with fallbacks, but we&#8217;re
   going to have a much higher percentage of interactive email clients. So
   we will be able to build a lot more advanced emails. They&#8217;ll be a
   lot more going on with dynamic content, dynamics CSSîmore of a personal
   experience as well.</p> <p>I think there&#8217;s still going to be a
   split. People hand-coding emails because you can build something very
   quick hand-coded. Just knock it together in Litmus Builder and send it
   out, and that&#8217;s a nice simple process. But also a lot more build
   processes and workflows, like Gulp and Grunt, and automating things of
   code, as well as the sort of simple drag-and-drop type editors which
   will have this advanced code built in the back of them, but anyoneîany
   marketer without any coding skillsîcan log on and do these things.</p>
   <h2>Dan Denney, Front-End Developer, Code School</h2> <p>If we&#8217;re
   talking about building email in the year 2020, our picture is gonna be
   way different than what we&#8217;re doing right now. We&#8217;re not
   going to be writing our own code. It&#8217;s going be a lot more
   drag-and-drop to making decisions around more like an úif that, then
   this,ù send this email. So we&#8217;re getting customized messages to
   all our users based on their data. And I think that the blast will be a
   thing of the past.</p> <h2>Mike Ragan, Designer, Action Rocket</h2>
   <p>The boundaries are always being pushed and it&#8217;s like and
   we&#8217;re expanding into nothing, like an always ever expanding
   universe. So I actually don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re going to
   look like. Maybe it will all be plain text. I don&#8217;t know. Maybe
   it&#8217;ll go completely on its head. And that will be it. I mean,
   that&#8217;s what people were saying for the watch. I mean, wearables,
   it&#8217;s the next step because it&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at now. I
   don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m interested to see how email design
   evolves.</p> <div class="cta"> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td

   transcript-</h3> <p>2015 brought lots of changes to the world of email
   marketing. Whether it was the replacement of Outlook.com with Office
   365, the introduction of the Apple Watch, or a continuous increase in
   mobile opens, email client market share stats have seen plenty of
   shifts. </p> <h3>TOP EMAIL CLIENTS</h3> <p>The top 10 most popular
   email clients of 2015.</p> <ol> <li>Apple iPhone: 33% </li> <li>Gmail:
   15% </li> <li>Apple iPad: 12%</li> <li>Google Android: 10%</li>
   <li>Apple Mail: 8%</li> <li>Outlook: 6% </li> <li>Yahoo! Mail: 3% </li>
   <li>Outlook.com: 3% </li> <li>Windows Live Mail: 2%</li>
   <li>Thunderbird: 1%</li> </ol> <h3>OPENS BY ENVIRONMENT</h3> <p>Over
   the course of 2015, mobile opens increased 17% and now represent 55% of
   opens. Webmail opens decreased 13% to end the year with 26% of opens,
   and desktop opens decreased 17% for a year-end 19% of total opens.</p>
   <p>55% of emails are now opened on mobile. Plus, since August 2015,
   mobile opens have surpassed the 50% mark.</p> <h4>MOBILE OPENS</h4>
   <p>Android opens increased 35% to represent 10% of opens, and iPhone
   opens rose from 27% to 33% of opens. Conversely, iPad opens decreased
   5% over the course of the year and now only represent 12% of opens.</p>
   <ul> <li>iPhone: Increased 22%</li> <li>iPad: Decreased 5%</li>
   <li>Android: Increased 35%</li> </ul> <p>iOS represents 45% of total
   market share, which is great news for email designers since HTML and
   CSS are well-supported. </p> <h4>DESKTOP OPENS</h4> <p>While the rest
   of desktop opens remained relatively stagnant in 2015, Outlook opens
   decreased 33% and now represent only 6% of opens.</p> <ul> <li>Apple
   Mail: Increased 1%</li> <li>Outlook: Decreased 33%</li>
   <li>Thunderbird: Increased 536%</li> <li>Windows Live Mail: Decreased
   25%</li> </ul> <p>While the popularity of Outlook overall is on the
   decline, older versions of the desktop clientîwhich also happen to have
   better HTML and CSS supportîare being phased out in favor of newer
   versions. Outlook 2016 for Windows was released in September 2015 and
   has already seen some adoption, picking up over 5% of Outlook opens.
   Outlook 2013 also saw a 50% gain over the year, whereas Outlook 2003
   dropped 35%.</p> <h4>WEBMAIL OPENS</h4> <p>Similar to desktop opens,
   webmail opens took a major hit in 2015. Webmail clients saw decreases
   of between 4% and 42%</p> <ul> <li>Gmail: Decreased 8%</li> <li>Yahoo!
   Mail: Decreased 28%</li> <li>Outlook.com: Decreased 42%</li> <li>AOL
   Mail: Decreased 4%</li> </ul> <p>The fall in Gmail opens and subsequent
   rise of iPhone and Android opens may suggest users of the Gmail app are
   switching back to the native email apps on these phones. The Gmail app
   for iOS and Android each have notoriously poor support for responsive
   design, which can lead to a frustrating experience for users.</p>
   <h3>YEAR IN REVIEW</h3> <p>Month-by-month highlights and email client
   news from 2015</p> <h4>January </h4> <p>The year starts out with
   desktop at 23%, mobile at 47%, and webmail at 30% of opens. The Outlook
   app for iOS and Android is launched.</p> <h4>February</h4> <p>Mobile
   opens dip to 46%, while webmail opens increase to 32%. </p>
   <h4>March</h4> <p>Mobile opens climb back up the ladder and reach 48%.
   </p> <h4>April</h4> <p>Android takes over the #5 spot with 8.5% of
   opens. Apple Mail falls to the #6 spot. The Apple Watch is launched,
   and along with it comes the addition of wearables to the email app

   Define It</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow"
   href="https://litmus.com/blog">Litmus Blog</a>.</p> <p>About a month
   ago, a friend and fellow Boston marketer and I got into a discussion
   about the merits of customer marketing, and more specifically, how
   email plays a role. </p> <p>Casey Hogan was frustrated, as she had just
   received her tenthî<em>tenth!</em>îupsell email from a brand that she had
   been using for four years.</p> <p>Obviously annoyed, she took to
   Twitter in search of empathy. </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"
   data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CX in need of upgrade:<br />1 Use

   Casey Hogan (@hogan) <a

   2015</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async
   src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>
   <p>Asked by another user to clarify, she went on:</p> <blockquote
   class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a
   href="https://twitter.com/netspencer">@netspencer</a> Not a great
   experience for a long time user.</p> <p>&mdash; Casey Hogan (@hogan) <a

   2015</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async
   src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
   <p>I added my .02 cents&#8230;</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"
   data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a
   href="https://twitter.com/hogan">@hogan</a> <a

   11, 2015</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async
   src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
   <p>&#8230;and the inspiration for this post was born. </p> <p>For <a
   href="https://twitter.com/hogan" target="_blank">Hogan</a>, formerly a
   marketer at <a href="http://www.drift.com/" target="_blank">Drift</a>
   and <a href="https://drizly.com/" target="_blank">Drizly</a>, the
   customer experience is something of great personal meaning. And like
   anything else worth analogizing, she related her experience to
   dating:</p> <blockquote><p>úGetting a subscriber is just like getting
   someone&#8217;s number&#8230;Most people don&#8217;t want to hear from
   someone they just met three times a day. I would also guess they
   don&#8217;t want to sporadically hear òhey can you set me up with your
   friends?ô either.ù</p></blockquote> <p>Conversely, by permission
   marketing standards, all seems fair. But when we consider how
   subscribersô rising expectations has worked to evolve what email spam
   really is, her frustration comes into focus.</p> <p>A friend and
   colleague of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/chadswhite"
   target="_blank">Chad White</a>, writes in his book <a
   href="http://www.amazon.com/Email-Marketing-Rules-Step-Step/dp/15009819
   74" target="_blank"><em>Email Marketing Rules</em></a> that úHaving
   permission only gets you so far nowadays. Irrelevant and unwanted email
   is the new spam in the eyes of both consumers and Internet Service
   Providers (ISPs).ù</p> <h2>How your customers define email spam</h2>
   <p>Whiteôs definition above is whiteboard material. </p> <p>Your
   customers view any irrelevant or unwanted email as spam. It doesnôt
   matter how long theyôve been a customer or if theyôve given you
   permissionîif your email is repeatedly of little to no relevance to
   them, itôs spam. </p> <p>Or, as was the case mentioned earlier, this
   particular brand was more interested in using Hogan to create new
   relationships than actually building a relationship with her. As
   detailed by Hogan, the customer experience looked something like
   this:</p> <ul> <li>Use code for first X free</li> <li>Refer friends,
   get $</li> <li>Refer friends, get $ ..</li> <li>Refer friends, get $
   &#8230;.</li> <li>Refer friends, get $ &#8230;..</li> </ul>
   <p>&#8230;and so on. Ten times. </p> <p>There was obviously no
   relevance for the user, otherwise she wouldnôt have taken to Twitter to
   voice her frustrations. But how are brands to define relevance? As
   White says in Email Marketing Rules, úitôs often discussed in vague,
   mystical terms.ù </p> <p>In an attempt to lift the veil a bit, Iôve
   detailed some ways Iôve found effective at ensuring a more relevant
   experience for subscribers.</p> <h2>Set the right expectations</h3>
   <p>This section is really about table stakes. If your subscribers arenôt
   sure of what kinds of communications to expect, youôve exposed yourself
   to the risk of being reported as spam, thus hurting your subscriber
   reputation and any future hopes of landing in the inbox.</p> <p>So
   tables stakes or not, itôs important to note here. </p> <p>Sign up forms
   and welcome emails are two areas of prime real estate you should use to
   clearly inform people what they will be receiving from your brand. </p>
   <p>If you plan on emailing occasional gated material, let people know
   in advance of them providing their email address. Whether or not you
   view additional communications as a value add is irrelevant, both to
   this principle and to your subscribers.</p> <p>Let subscribers of any
   list know ahead of time exactly what they can expect to receive from
   your brand. Then, most importantly, reduce your messaging to specific
   lists to the content they expect to receive. </p> <h2>Personalize the
   subject matter, not the subject</h2> <p>Advances in marketing
   technology has resulted in a misconception of what personalization
   really is, and more unfortunately, in marketers abusing the tactics
   available for achieving faux personalization. </p> <p>So letôs start
   with what personalization is not. Itôs not:</p> <ul> <li>Knowing your
   subscriber&#8217;s name, or</li> <li>Location</li> <li>Company
   name</li> <li>Job title</li> <li>Industry, or any other basic
   demographic information</li> </ul> <p>Personalization is about
   interests, behavior, and challenges. And while most brands can talk
   about these characteristics in detail as they pertain to their target
   audience, many do not tailor the email marketing strategy to
   communicate the right messages to those who need it most. </p> <p>Letôs
   use an example from my own inbox. </p> <p>I joined the <a
   href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/" target="_blank">Dollar Shave
   Club</a> last fall, and right before my first box shipped, I received
   an email with the subject line, úYour first box is about to ship. Toss
   more in.ù </p> <p>This was pretty pertinent information for me.
   Naturally, I opened.</p> <p>Inside were four product suggestions,
   including a shave butter I had never tried. I wouldnôt normally purchase
   shave butter, but at $4.99, I thought, úWhy not? One less thing I have
   to remember at the store.ù </p> <p>Dollar Shave Club knows this about me
   (and all its users): we value convenience over features. Their razors
   donôt have 8 blades, a battery, or other gimmicks. Itôs just a razor. But
   theyôre delivered to the doorstep every month, for less than weôd pay in
   the store. </p> <blockquote><p>Convenience over
   features.</p></blockquote> <p>This email, from the subject line through
   the body copy, stayed consistent with this message. Thatôs
   personalization. They didn&#8217;t need to use my name anywhere in the
   email. Instead, they know why I buy from them and use this to improve
   my experience and increase sales. </p> <p>Now, this was a more general
   form of personalization. Most automation software enables you to
   collect more relevant, personal information on your customers and
   prospects. Not only should you be gathering information around buyer
   interests, behaviors, preferences, purchase history, and more, you
   should also be powering your personalization efforts with the insights
   you glean from it.</p> <h2>User-friendly</h2> <p>Your subscribers are
   viewing email on a variety of different apps and devices, each with its
   own rendering quirks that affect the way your email looks and performs.
   </p> <p>These are challenges your marketing and design teams face.</p>
   <p>From your customerôs standpoint, their challenge is that it may be
   really hard to read your email on mobile, or that your call-to-action
   isnôt úclickableù on whichever device they happen to be using. Or maybe
   itôs that some (or all) the images used are broken, or your links are
   broken or leading to the wrong page. </p> <p>Poor user experience leads
   to frustration, which as shown in the opening, could also lead to
   declarations of spam. </p> <h2>Utility</h2> <p>While most marketers
   believe that what they produce and send is of value to their customers,
   in order to truly be of utility to your customers, you need to think in
   their terms rather than your own. </p> <p>Besides using customer
   intelligence to segment your messaging (discussed earlier), White lists
   two other ways that email marketers can execute greater value and
   utility in their strategies: worthwhile and engaging messaging. </p>
   <h3>Worthwhile</h3> <p>Discounts, deals, and buyer-related information
   are the number one reason people sign up for emails. This aligns
   perfectly with David Ogilvyôs summation that, more than anything, people
   care about saving money.</p> <p>However, be careful as to use these
   motivations as a means to take advantage of your customers. As
   evidenced in the opening, many brands essentially hold their customers
   ransom with discounts and deals. </p> <p>In other words, they follow
   the formula of úif you perform [x], weôll allow you to save [y].ù </p>
   <p>Could it also be possible that úperforming [x]ù aligns with a
   buyer&#8217;s interests while also appealing to their motivation to
   save money? Sure. But be careful, as thereôs a very thin line in
   appealing to a customerôs motivation and holding them ransom.</p>
   <h3>Engaging</h3> <p>Chances are a sizeable portionîif not the
   majorityîof your email list is not made up of customers, but
   prospectsîprospects who are not yet ready to buy, but would benefit from
   educational materials that pertain to their specific needs and
   challenges. </p> <p>Hereôs where the intelligence youôve gathered about
   your prospectsîand the subsequent segmentationîcome into play in order to
   deliver the right content to the right people. The úspray and prayù
   approach is not only less effective, itôs also less valuable to your
   subscribers. </p> <p>You may find yourself sending multiple variations
   of an email, thus spreading your reach across several emails rather
   than one, in order to achieve this, but you may also find yourself with
   higher engagement as a result. </p> <h2>Email spam redefined</h2>
   <p>Your subscribers donôt think in terms of algorithms, they think in
   terms of relevance. </p> <p>While ISP algorithms and content filtering
   are a critical component of ensuring your emails even make it to the
   inbox, your sender reputation and level of subscriber engagement are
   even more important when it comes to optimizing for the inbox. </p>
   <p>Itôs time marketers redefined how they define email spam, because
   their customers and prospects already have.</p> <h2>GET THE LATEST

Webmail Increases to 29% for November Email Client Market Share

   [ 0 By Kayla Voigt

   Every month, we track opens from more than 1 billion emails using
   Litmus‚Äô Email Analytics and share the trends we observe in various
   email clients and environments. In November, webmail market share grew
   to 29%, while mobile and desktop dropped to 55% and 16%, respectively.

A REFRESHER ON MARKET SHARE TERMS + EMAIL OPENS

     * ‚ÄúMobile‚Äù refers not only to mobile-specific email clients, like
       iPhone or Android, but also where users are opening their email. If
       they‚Äôre using the Yahoo Mail app on their iPhone, for example, that
       counts as a mobile open for iPhone. This also includes tablets like
       the iPad.
     * ‚ÄúDesktop‚Äù shows any email client opened on a desktop application.
       That means any email client that required you to install software.
       If you‚Äôre using a Mac, for instance, that could mean Apple Mail. On
       a PC, that might be Outlook.
     * ‚ÄúWebmail,‚Äù by contrast, means you‚Äôre using an email client within a
       browser. Logging onto your Gmail account or using Outlook.com fall
       under the ‚Äúwebmail‚Äù category.

   How do we track opens? Open tracking in Litmus Email Analytics is based
   on 1√ó1 invisible pixel image tracking, which is the same technique that
   your email service provider uses to report your
   open rate. When a customer opens your email, the image is loaded. This
   counts as an open. (Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthe tracking pixel doesn‚Äôt alter your
   carefully planned designs!)

   Let‚Äôs dig into the data:

Top 10 Email Clients

   Apple iPhone holds the top spot with 33.69% of all opens, with Gmail
   coming in a distant second at 15.96%.

iPad Growth Holds, Android Drops for Mobile

   nov16emailmarketshare.002

   While mobile dropped to 55%, it may be a regular fluctuation. Mobile
   market share oscillated between 56% and 55% share since July 2016.
   However, the drop was a surprise since Black Friday mobile sales broke
   records this month. Since many major retailers offered special
   mobile-only deals, it may be that those deals were promoted in-app,
   instead of via email. Either way, Black Friday mobile sales topped $1
   billion‚Äîmobile is still king.

   Last month‚Äôs trends continue this month, with Apple iPad holding at
   12.4%, its highest point since February 2015. Before last month, iPad
   hadn‚Äôt been above 12% since January 2016. This growth may signal that
   iPad users may be replacing their laptop or desktop with an iPad, at
   least for email.

   Android continues to drop, down to 8.56% total opens, almost a 1%
   decrease since last month (when Android also dropped 1%).

   This drop may be due to users switching ship from Android‚Äôs native
   email app to Gmail. Recent changes like the ‚ÄúGmailify‚Äù feature that
   allows users to obtain an email address without ‚Äú@gmail.com‚Äù may appeal
   to Android‚Äôs user base. In addition, Gmail now supports responsive
   design‚Äîholdouts turned off by a poor user experience from
   non-responsive emails in the past may now be switching.

Desktop Drops to 16%

   nov16emailmarketshare.003

   Desktop opens dropped to 16% this month, its lowest ever. Desktop has
   been trending downwards since May 2016 and we may see additional drops
   as mobile and webmail become the choice for email users.

   Outlook remains in the top 10 at 6.05% of market share despite dropping
   steadily since August 2016. And while Outlook may account for a low
   overall percentage of email client market share, it‚Äôs important to know
   what percentage of your audience is opening there‚Äîespecially because
   Outlook can give email geeks headaches.

   Here are a few things to be aware of when coding emails for Outlook:
     * To properly structure your emails for maximum
       cross-device/client/browser render-ability, you‚Äôll need to use
       tables.
     * Outlook doesn‚Äôt support animated GIFs‚Äîit will only show the first
       frame.
     * To make background images work, Outlook requires the use of VML
     * Outlook has no padding support on p, div, and a tags

   There is hope, email geeks. We‚Äôve partnered with Microsoft to
   prioritize email rendering bugs in Outlook, identify issues faster, and
   announce improvements and fixes to the community. You can submit
   Outlook bugs here.

Webmail Opens Grow to 29%

   nov16emailmarketshare.004

   The main driver of webmail growth? Gmail.

   Gmail remains the most popular webmail client by far, jumping up from
   15% to 17% this month. While Gmail has been notoriously difficult to
   design and develop for, there‚Äôs hope! The Gmail team recently rolled
   out support responsive design, improved font styling, and CSS for
   accessibility.

   We‚Äôre following this closely on our Gmail live ticker as changes
   continue to roll out this quarter. While that may take some time, this
   month saw the rollout finally hit the Gmail iOS app. All Gmail mobile
   apps now support responsive email. G Suite accounts show the rendering
   update as well.

   If there was ever a time to go for responsive design, it‚Äôs now! We
   define responsive design as using fluid tables, fluid images, and media
   queries to control the layout of an email across different device
   sizes. Get started with our how-to guide.

WHERE DID WE GET ALL THIS DATA?

   This data is derived from over 1 billion opens collected worldwide with
   Litmus Email Analytics between November 1, 2016 and November 30, 2016.
   It highlights worldwide trends across all industries and verticals.
   Some email clients may be over- or under-represented due to image
   blocking. Tracking trends over time is the best way to monitor open
   data for email!

WHICH EMAIL CLIENTS ARE MOST POPULAR WITH YOUR AUDIENCE?

   While general email client open data is great for looking at trends,
   it‚Äôs your audience that matters. With the addition of a small tracking
   code to your campaigns, Litmus Email Analytics generates a report of
   where your subscribers open your emails. Use that data to focus your
   testing efforts‚Äîand ensure your campaigns look great in inboxes where
   your subscribers are opening.

   <h2>How do I add post-click tracking to my email campaigns?</h2>
   <p>While post-click tracking will vary based on the web analytics
   tracking tool youôre using, weôll cover the one of the most popularîGoogle
   Analyticsîin this post.</p> <p>If youôre using Google Analytics, you can
   track your subscribersô post-click activities by adding UTM codes to the
   end of the URLs in your email. Also known as UTM parameters, UTM codes
   are bits of text added to the end of your URL to help you track user
   behavior on your website.</p> <p>If youôve ever been to a website, or
   hovered over a text link, and noticed a URL like the one below,
   it&#8217;s likely because UTM codes are being used.</p>
   <pre><code>https://litmus.com/email-builder?utm_campaign=tracking_manag
   er_launch&#038;utm_source=pardot&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;utm_content
   =image1</code></pre> <p>In the example above, youôll see the website
   address (<strong>https://litmus.com/email-builder</strong>), and then a
   snippet of text after the question mark. The snippet of text following
   the website address are the UTM codes.</p> <p>Adding UTM codes to your
   links wonôt break your links. Instead, they give you access to data that
   goes beyond the opens and clicks provided by your ESP. </p> <p>Each
   portion of the UTM code tracks a different aspect of the traffic on
   your website:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Campaign Name</strong>
   <em><strong>(utm_campaign=tracking_manager_launch)</strong></em>: Use
   this to identify a specific product promotion or campaign. In the
   example above, the campaign is útracking_managerù which means the focus
   of the email campaign was the <a
   href="https://litmus.com/help/testing/litmus-builder-guide?utm_campaign
   =tracking_manager&#038;utm_source=litmusblog&#038;utm_medium=blog#track
   ing-manager">Tracking Manager</a> launch.</li> <li><strong>Campaign
   Source</strong> <em><strong>(utm_source=pardot)</strong></em>: The
   campaign source should cover where your traffic is coming to the site
   from. In the example above, the email was sent via Pardot so that is
   the source. If your content was shared via Twitter, for instance, you
   would use &#8220;twitter&#8221; as your source.</li>
   <li><strong>Campaign Medium</strong>
   <em><strong>(utm_medium=email)</strong></em>: Use the campaign medium
   to take a high-level look at your marketing efforts. In the example
   above, the medium is simply úemail.ù Youôll be able to track all of your
   general email marketing efforts, but then can drill down into the
   source and name to get detailed data on specific campaigns.</li>
   <li><strong>Campaign Content</strong>
   <em><strong>(utm_content=image1)</strong></em>: While not a required
   UTM code, campaign content is a great way to dig deeper into your data.
   You can use them to specify text links, CTA buttons, and even linked
   images to see which types of CTAs generate not only the most clicks
   (you can see that in your ESPôs data), but what types of CTAs encourage
   the most post-click activities.</li> </ul> <p>The use of these UTM code
   elements varies based on how you want your information displayed in
   Google Analytics. In the example above, we have the medium as the
   highest level of organization, followed by source, name, and content.
   How you organize yours is up to you!</p>
   <p><em><strong>Note</strong></em><em>: UTM codes are case sensitive!
   So, úPardotù and úpardotù would both be separated in Google Analytics
   reports. Be consistent when it comes to capitalization to avoid any
   confusions.</em></p> <h3>Creating UTM codes</h3> <p>There are numerous
   ways to create UTM codes: using Googleôs URL builder tool, manually
   writing them, or using an internal customized tool. </p> <h4>Google URL
   builder</h4> <p>Google has a <a
   href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867">free
   tool</a> for creating URLs with UTM codes on them. You plug in your
   URL, and the numerous UTM codes and a link will be generated for
   you.</p> <h4>Manually writing them</h4> <p>While time consuming, itôs
   possible to manually add UTM codes to each of your URLs once youôve
   memorized the formula. However, creating them yourself definitely
   leaves room for error.</p> <h4>Internal tool</h4> <p>Keeping track of
   UTM codes can be a bit unwieldy depending on how many campaigns youôre
   running. If you have an awesome dev team (we definitely do!), then you
   can create a tool of your own to manage your UTM creation.</p> <figure

   src="https://d31v04zdn5vmni.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016
   /03/utm-tool.png" alt="UTM tool - post-click tracking" /></figure>
   <p>While time consuming from a dev perspective, this internal tool has
   been a great way for us to create and organize our UTM codes.</p>
   <h3>Adding UTM codes to your campaigns</h3> <p>So what do you do after
   you have your UTM codes for a campaign? Itôs time to add them to the
   links in your campaign. </p> <h4>Manually adding them</h4> <p>You can
   manually add your UTM codes at the end of every link in your campaign.
   Simply search your email for URLs linking to your site, and add the
   codes to the end of the URLs. </p> <p>While this is definitely an
   option, itôs time consuming, and leaves room for errors, such as missing
   links.</p> <h4>Some Email service providers can do it for you</h4>
   <p>Many ESPs support automated link tracking. For example, <a
   href="http://help.campaignmonitor.com/topic.aspx?t=111&#038;_ga=1.78721
   620.1733968664.1396275600">Campaign Monitor has a Google Analytics
   integration</a>. Once users link their accounts together, they enter
   the domains they want to track (ie. ours would be litmus.com), as well
   as the campaign source. </p> <p>Campaign names are automatically pulled
   from the name of the campaign in Campaign Monitor, and the medium is
   set to email. Neither of these aspects can be edited by the user. The
   UTM codes are then added to every link on the domain(s) selected during
   the integration. </p> <p>While automated link tracking by ESPs is a big
   time saver, you donôt have the flexibility to edit campaign names to
   your preference. </p> <h4>Tracking Manager in Litmus Builder</h4>
   <p>With Tracking Manager in Litmus Builder, adding tracking codes to
   links in your email has never been quicker or easier. </p> <p>Say
   goodbye to the hassle of copying your tracking code, endlessly
   scrolling or searching for every single link the email, and pasting the
   tracking code to each link. And now you can customize your UTM codes to
   suit your tracking preferences.</p> <p>Simply input your tracking code,
   and select which links in the email youôd like to apply it to. </p>

   doubling the number of people behind the magic with 24 new
   employees.</p> <p>With that, weôve added talent from all corners of the
   globe. Our úremote firstù culture allows us to be humans first and
   employees second. We get to watch our kids act in school plays, go for
   a quick run, refrain from putting on pants in the morning if we want
   to, or indulge our wanderlust, as long as we get our jobs done. And
   though thatôs awesome, thereôs no substitute for face-to-face
   bonding.</p> <p>úI love that weôre remote first,ù says Paul Farnell,
   Co-founder and CEO of Litmus. úItôs opened us up to talent we never would
   have seen otherwise. Staying connectedîwhether thatôs through Slack,
   video conferencing, or frequent callsîis one of our challenges, and I
   think weôve all really embraced that challenge.ù</p> <p>We just spent
   some time coming together as a team at our annual company retreatîfrom
   as far away as Pakistan and Ecuadorîto reconnect, recharge, and
   ultimately re-inspire ourselves and our teammates. We whiteboarded,
   presented, chatted, and skied together to remind ourselves who we are
   and what matters most to us. </p> <blockquote><p> úEverything we do is
   as a team. Weôre always seeking to improve ourselves and celebrate the
   accomplishments as a group effort. Our semi-annual company-wide meetups
   are my favorite way we do that.ù &#8211;Paul Farnell </p></blockquote>

   opens have remained stagnant since January, mobile opens increased
   1.9%, and webmail opens decreased 3.3%.</p> <p>The differences might
   seem slight compared to last month, but it&#8217;s a major change from
   last year. Since February 2015:</p> <ul> <li>Mobile opens have
   increased 19.6%</li> <li>Webmail opens have decreased 18.8%</li>
   <li>Desktop opens have decreased 13.6%</li> </ul> <h3>DIGGING INTO
   MOBILE OPENS</h3> <figure id="post-11917 media-11917"

   <p>Apple iPhone and iPad represent 44.6% of total opens, and 80.8% of
   mobile opens. This is good news for email designers since iOS has great
   support for HTML and CSS. If youôre seeing a large percentage of your
   audience opening in these clients, try using modern techniques like <a

   038;utm_medium=blog">HTML5 video and CSS3 animation</a> to see if it
   increases engagement.</p> <p>Since January, iPhone opens increased
   4.1%, while iPad opens decreased 4.1%. iPad opens have been on a
   continual decline over the past year and have decreased 4.9% since
   March 2015. </p> <p>Itôs probably no coincidence that the iPadôs slump to
   11.6% of opens has accompanied a <a

   iPads, while Q4 2015 gures report sales of 9.8 millionîa 20% drop. </p>

   Outlook opens have remained relatively stagnant since January, theyôve
   taken a major hit since last year. Outlook opens have decreased a
   whopping 27.2% since March 2015. This decrease is likely a result of
   business shifting away from expensive desktop suites, and moving to
   scalable services, like Gmail Apps. </p> <p>However, Outlook opens
   still represent 6.7% of market share, so it shouldnôt be discounted.
   Digging into Outlook stats, hereôs a breakdown of which versions
   subscribers are using:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Outlook 2000-2003</strong>:
   15%</li> <li><strong>Outlook 2007</strong>: 16%</li>
   <li><strong>Outlook 2010</strong>: 35%</li> <li><strong>Outlook
   2013</strong>: 27%</li> <li><strong>Outlook 2016</strong>: 7%</li>
   </ul> <p>Unfortunately for email designers, these later versions of
   Outlook use Microsoft Word to render emails. <a

   is less than ideal. </p> <p>Hereôs just some of what email designers are
   up against:</p> <ul> <li>No support for background images in divs and
   table cells</li> <li>No support for CSS float or position</li> <li>No
   support for text shadow</li> <li>Poor support for padding and
   margin</li> <li>Poor support for CSS width and height</li> <li>Problems

   <p>Webmail opens have remained relatively unchanged since last month,
   but have seen major changes since this time last year. Since March
   2015, Gmail opens decreased 11.7% and Outlook.com opens decreased
   53.3%.</p> <p>The fall in Gmail opens and subsequent rise of iPhone and
   Android opens may suggest users of the Gmail app are switching back to
   the native email apps on these phones. The Gmail app for iOS and
   Android continually frustrate users with their <a

   https://litmus.com/blog/?p=11887 <p>While opens and clicks are a great
   way to measure overall engagement, they don't paint the whole picture

   href="https://litmus.com/blog">Litmus Blog</a>.</p> <p>Every
   interaction with your subscribers counts. Send emails that your
   subscribers want, that are relevant to their needs and interests, that
   excite them, and (most importantly!) that make them want to take
   action. </p> <p>Campaigns that accomplish all the above not only win
   the hearts and minds of your customers, they&#8217;re a win for your
   business. And we&#8217;re particularly proud of one campaign in
   particular that also won an award: the <a
   href="https://emailexperience.org/events/dma-email-experience-councils-
   email-marketing-awards/2016-eec-award-winners/">2016 EEC Email
   Marketing Program Award</a> for úBest or Most Innovative Integration
   with Another Channel.ù</p> <p>That campaign was our save the date email
   for TEDC15 (The Email Design Conference).</p> <p>What surprised us?
   This campaign wasnôt a success because it had the most opens or clicks.
   In fact, it had much lower open and click rates compared to our other
   emails. </p> <p>However, opens and clicks wasnôt our goal. The main
   call-to-action in the campaign asked our readers to tweetîand, boy, did
   we get a lot of tweets! It excelled at its stated goals of driving
   awareness and creating buzz around the conference, and weôre humbled and
   grateful to have won an award in recognition of those efforts! </p>
   <h2>A look at the campaign</h2> <h3>The goals</h3> <p>After <a
   href="https://litmus.com/blog/how-to-code-html5-video-background-in-ema
   il?utm_campaign=inspiration_eecaward&#038;utm_source=litmusblog&#038;ut
   m_medium=blog">embedding a video background</a> into TEDC14ôs úsave the
   date,ù we had set high expectations with the community for a follow-up
   in 2015. As such, the primary goal of the campaign was to surprise,
   delight, and inspire our audience with a creative use of email,
   preferably leveraging a technique that is rarely seen or thought to be
   unsupported in email. </p> <p>By utilizing innovative techniques in
   event-related emails, we wanted to demonstrate thought leadership and
   prove to our subscribers that we have the expertise and skills to teach
   others at TEDC. Additional goals were to raise awareness and excitement
   about the event, drive social mentions, and create anticipation for
   future ticket sales. </p> <h3>The email</h3> <p>After many
   brainstorming sessions, we opted to announce dates and generate
   excitement for TEDC15 by embedding an <a
   href="https://litmus.com/blog/how-to-code-a-live-dynamic-twitter-feed-i

   href="https://litmus.com/pub/c039b69/screenshots">Litmus test
   results</a> to see how it displayed in 40+ email clients.</em> </p>
   <p>úSave the dateù emails were sent to Litmus subscribers and past
   attendees. Each contained a live dynamic Twitter feed featuring tweets
   using the #TEDC15 hashtag. As recipients opened the email, live tweets
   appeared within the email. Subscribers tweeted using the hashtag, then
   returned to the email to see their own message appear live in the
   stream <em>inside</em> the email.</p> <h2>Measuring success: What
   metrics matter?</h2> <p>The campaign garnered widespread attention,
   resulting in 5,000 new visitors to the Litmus website, 1,000 new
   prospects, and 750 tweets containing the event hashtagîall within 24
   hours. </p> <p>To date, itôs garnered nearly 1,260 forwards and 350
   prints. More than 60% of the people that opened the email spent 18 or
   more seconds reading the message, the highest duration of engagement of
   any email weôve ever sent. </p> <p>When we launched ticket sales a few
   weeks later, early bird tickets sold out in 10 minutes for the Boston
   event and 48 hours for the London event.</p> <p>Despite being sent
   nearly a year ago, the campaign continues to drive additional email and
   social engagement as users re-visit the email and contribute to the
   Twitter stream. </p> <p>The goal of this campaign went beyond opens and
   clicks to draw the email community together and create awareness for
   the event. Between hundreds of tweets, dozens of forwards and prints,
   and early bird tickets selling in minutes, it exceeded every
   expectation.</p> <h2>Whatôs your most successful campaign? </h2> <p>Many
   marketers focus on open and click rates. While those metrics can be a
   great way to measure overall engagement, they donôt paint the whole
   picture of a campaignôs performance, especially when different emails
   have different goals. </p> <p>What has been your most successful
   campaign? How did you measure its success? </p> <p><a

   <p>With the passing of Ray Tomlinson, the inventor of modern email and
   the @ symbol, weôd like to thank him for creating our favorite
   communication medium and reflect on how itôs evolved over the past 45
   years. </p> <p>Prior to 1971, email existed in a limited format. Users
   could only share messages between people on the same limited network.
   However, in 1971, Tomlinson, who worked in Boston at Bolt, Beranek, and
   Newman, took it to the next level. He conceived the method of sending
   messages across a network, and introduced the @ symbol to allow
   messages to be targeted at certain users on certain machines. It was
   the start of 1:1 personal emails.</p> <p>Due to the scarcityîand high
   costîof computers at the time, very few people had personal computers,
   so the popularity of email as we know it today didnôt take off until
   years later. It wasnôt until personal computers became more commonplace
   and online services boomed in the late 1980s and early 1990s that email
   became more conventional.</p> <p>Email evolved into both a personal and
   business mediumîwhich is exactly what Tomlinson predicted. In a 2012
   interview with <a
   href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/2/2991486/ray-tomlinson-email-inve
   ntor-interview-i-see-email-being-used">The Verge</a>, Tomlinson said, úI
   see email being used, by and large, exactly the way I envisioned. In
   particular, itôs not strictly a work tool or strictly a personal thing.
   Everybody uses it in different ways, but they use it in a way they find
   works for them.ù</p> <p>And itôs continued to evolveîand grow in
   popularityîevery year since its inception.</p> <h2>The current state of
   email</h2> <p>Today, there are over 205 billion emails sent each day,
   and over 2.6 billion email users. And, these numbers are expected to
   exponentially increase. The <a
   href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Email-Stati
   stics-Report-2015-2019-Executive-Summary.pdf">Radicati Group</a>
   predicts there will be over 246.5 billion emails sent each day and 2.9
   billion email users by 2019. </p> <p>There are now dozens upon dozens
   of different email clients and apps available. Users can choose between
   a variety of desktop, webmail, and mobile clientsîand even wearables
   like the Apple Watchîto read and send their email. Over time, the
   popularity of reading on mobile and tablets has increased. Today, over

   where-subscribers-read-email-infographic?utm_campaign=industry_tomlinso
   n&#038;utm_source=litmusblog&#038;utm_medium=blog">55%</a> of emails
   are opened in those environments. </p> <p>Email has become one of the
   most powerful channels to reach consumers. With ROI of <a
   href="http://cdn.emailmonday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/National-cl
   ient-email-2015-DMA.pdf">38-to-1</a>, it has the highest rate of return
   among digital marketing channels. And people want to receive emails,
   with <a
   href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/customer-communicati
   on-by-channel#">72%</a> of consumers saying they prefer companies to
   communicate with them via email over any other channel. </p> <p>Every
   year, we push the limits of what&#8217;s possible in email. Emails are
   no longer solely text-based. With the use of HTML and CSS, they can
   have colors, buttons, images, and more. </p> <p>Emails are now
   segmented based on subscriber preferences or activities, and can
   include dynamic content to create a personalized experience. </p>
   <p>More recently, email designers have begun using techniques commonly
   found in advanced web design, like <a

   <p>Our survey results found that email is more likely to be around in
   10 years than Facebook, cable TV, Twitter, and other channels.</p>
   <p>Hereôs just a preview of some exciting predictions about the future
   of email:</p> <ul> <li>Subscribers will be able to make purchases right

   <p>Think of the innovations that have impacted email marketing
   professionals in the past 5 yearsîthings like mobile devices becoming
   the dominant email-reading platform, the debut of the Apple Watch, the
   firm establishment of engagement-based email filtering by ISPs, the
   cross-channel integration of email marketing, and the emergence of
   interactive email functionality like email carrousels and hamburger
   menus.</p> <p>Considering all of that change, we couldnôt help but
   wonder: What do the next 5 years have in store?</p> <p>For our <a

   og&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_campaign=email2020&#038;utm_content=to
   plink">Email Marketing in 2020</a> report, we asked 20 experts to
   tackle this question. Their answers augur dramatic changes in
   personalization, automation, interactivity, compliance, and much
   more.</p> <p>We asked this same question of six of our speakers at <a
   target="_blank"
   href="https://litmus.com/conference?utm_source=litmusblog&#038;utm_medi
   um=blog&#038;utm_campaign=email2020">The Email Design Conference</a>.
   Their answers focused on email production workflow, coding support, the
   subscriber experience, and interactive elements.</p> <p>You can watch
   the full interview here, or read a transcript of it below.</p>
   <p><script charset="ISO-8859-1"
   src="//fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script> <div
   class="wistia_embed wistia_async_ynzparh3zi"
   style="height:293px;width:520px">&nbsp;</div> <h2>Brian Graves, UI Team
   Lead, DEG</h2> <p>In 2020, the subscriber experience in my mind will
   really be a lot more interactive in nature. So, all these new CSS
   elements and things we can do there are going to kind of be mainstream
   at that point in my mind. We&#8217;re going to move past some of these
   limitations of older clients like Outlook and hopefully by then Outlook
   and Gmail have moved on as well and we&#8217;ll have much more advanced
   things we can do in the inbox.</p> <h2>Fabio Carneiro, Lead Email
   Developer &#038; UX Designer, MailChimp</h2> <p>So in five years I
   think the subscriber experience willîit will probably get messier before
   it gets better. You know, there&#8217;s a lot of push right now forîas
   all these exciting technologies become more and more available to email
   designersîthere is certainly this rush to try to use everything you can
   without necessarily stopping to think about whether or not you should.
   So we&#8217;re going to be fighting a lot of that certainly over the
   next five yearsîI mean, definitely over the next year, just given how
   fast we move.</p> <h2>Lee Munroe, Product Design Lead, Mailgun by
   Rackspace</h2> <p>We&#8217;re going to see a lot more front-end web
   development coming into email. We&#8217;ve seen responsive design
   obviously come in to email. We&#8217;re going to see a lot more
   eventually come over to email as the clients catch up, hopefully. Maybe
   we&#8217;ll even see email standards at some point. Fingers
   crossed.</p> <h2>Mark Robbins, Email Developer, Rebelmail</h2> <p>In
   2020, there&#8217;s still going to be some sort of overflow from the
   old things. People will still be using older versions of Outlook.
   We&#8217;re still going to have to work with fallbacks, but we&#8217;re
   going to have a much higher percentage of interactive email clients. So
   we will be able to build a lot more advanced emails. They&#8217;ll be a
   lot more going on with dynamic content, dynamics CSSîmore of a personal
   experience as well.</p> <p>I think there&#8217;s still going to be a
   split. People hand-coding emails because you can build something very
   quick hand-coded. Just knock it together in Litmus Builder and send it
   out, and that&#8217;s a nice simple process. But also a lot more build
   processes and workflows, like Gulp and Grunt, and automating things of
   code, as well as the sort of simple drag-and-drop type editors which
   will have this advanced code built in the back of them, but anyoneîany
   marketer without any coding skillsîcan log on and do these things.</p>
   <h2>Dan Denney, Front-End Developer, Code School</h2> <p>If we&#8217;re
   talking about building email in the year 2020, our picture is gonna be
   way different than what we&#8217;re doing right now. We&#8217;re not
   going to be writing our own code. It&#8217;s going be a lot more
   drag-and-drop to making decisions around more like an úif that, then
   this,ù send this email. So we&#8217;re getting customized messages to
   all our users based on their data. And I think that the blast will be a
   thing of the past.</p> <h2>Mike Ragan, Designer, Action Rocket</h2>
   <p>The boundaries are always being pushed and it&#8217;s like and
   we&#8217;re expanding into nothing, like an always ever expanding
   universe. So I actually don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re going to
   look like. Maybe it will all be plain text. I don&#8217;t know. Maybe
   it&#8217;ll go completely on its head. And that will be it. I mean,
   that&#8217;s what people were saying for the watch. I mean, wearables,
   it&#8217;s the next step because it&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at now. I
   don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m interested to see how email design
   evolves.</p> <div class="cta"> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td

   transcript-</h3> <p>2015 brought lots of changes to the world of email
   marketing. Whether it was the replacement of Outlook.com with Office
   365, the introduction of the Apple Watch, or a continuous increase in
   mobile opens, email client market share stats have seen plenty of
   shifts. </p> <h3>TOP EMAIL CLIENTS</h3> <p>The top 10 most popular
   email clients of 2015.</p> <ol> <li>Apple iPhone: 33% </li> <li>Gmail:
   15% </li> <li>Apple iPad: 12%</li> <li>Google Android: 10%</li>
   <li>Apple Mail: 8%</li> <li>Outlook: 6% </li> <li>Yahoo! Mail: 3% </li>
   <li>Outlook.com: 3% </li> <li>Windows Live Mail: 2%</li>
   <li>Thunderbird: 1%</li> </ol> <h3>OPENS BY ENVIRONMENT</h3> <p>Over
   the course of 2015, mobile opens increased 17% and now represent 55% of
   opens. Webmail opens decreased 13% to end the year with 26% of opens,
   and desktop opens decreased 17% for a year-end 19% of total opens.</p>
   <p>55% of emails are now opened on mobile. Plus, since August 2015,
   mobile opens have surpassed the 50% mark.</p> <h4>MOBILE OPENS</h4>
   <p>Android opens increased 35% to represent 10% of opens, and iPhone
   opens rose from 27% to 33% of opens. Conversely, iPad opens decreased
   5% over the course of the year and now only represent 12% of opens.</p>
   <ul> <li>iPhone: Increased 22%</li> <li>iPad: Decreased 5%</li>
   <li>Android: Increased 35%</li> </ul> <p>iOS represents 45% of total
   market share, which is great news for email designers since HTML and
   CSS are well-supported. </p> <h4>DESKTOP OPENS</h4> <p>While the rest
   of desktop opens remained relatively stagnant in 2015, Outlook opens
   decreased 33% and now represent only 6% of opens.</p> <ul> <li>Apple
   Mail: Increased 1%</li> <li>Outlook: Decreased 33%</li>
   <li>Thunderbird: Increased 536%</li> <li>Windows Live Mail: Decreased
   25%</li> </ul> <p>While the popularity of Outlook overall is on the
   decline, older versions of the desktop clientîwhich also happen to have
   better HTML and CSS supportîare being phased out in favor of newer
   versions. Outlook 2016 for Windows was released in September 2015 and
   has already seen some adoption, picking up over 5% of Outlook opens.
   Outlook 2013 also saw a 50% gain over the year, whereas Outlook 2003
   dropped 35%.</p> <h4>WEBMAIL OPENS</h4> <p>Similar to desktop opens,
   webmail opens took a major hit in 2015. Webmail clients saw decreases
   of between 4% and 42%</p> <ul> <li>Gmail: Decreased 8%</li> <li>Yahoo!
   Mail: Decreased 28%</li> <li>Outlook.com: Decreased 42%</li> <li>AOL
   Mail: Decreased 4%</li> </ul> <p>The fall in Gmail opens and subsequent
   rise of iPhone and Android opens may suggest users of the Gmail app are
   switching back to the native email apps on these phones. The Gmail app
   for iOS and Android each have notoriously poor support for responsive
   design, which can lead to a frustrating experience for users.</p>
   <h3>YEAR IN REVIEW</h3> <p>Month-by-month highlights and email client
   news from 2015</p> <h4>January </h4> <p>The year starts out with
   desktop at 23%, mobile at 47%, and webmail at 30% of opens. The Outlook
   app for iOS and Android is launched.</p> <h4>February</h4> <p>Mobile
   opens dip to 46%, while webmail opens increase to 32%. </p>
   <h4>March</h4> <p>Mobile opens climb back up the ladder and reach 48%.
   </p> <h4>April</h4> <p>Android takes over the #5 spot with 8.5% of
   opens. Apple Mail falls to the #6 spot. The Apple Watch is launched,
   and along with it comes the addition of wearables to the email app
   fleet.</p> <h4>May</h4> <p>Outlook drops from the #4 to #6 spot.
   Android opens continue to climb and reach the #4 spot with 8.6% of
   opens.</p> <h4>June</h4> <p>More Outlook, Android, and Apple Mail
   swapping! Outlook regains control of #4 spot with 9% of opens, while
   Android drops to #5 spot and Apple Mail drops to #6 spot.</p>
   <h4>July</h4> <p>Outlook and Android continue their flips. Android
   regains control of #4 spotîand stays there the rest of the year. The
   latest version of Windows is launched and it comes with a new universal
   mail appîOutlook Mail. </p> <h4>August</h4> <p>Yahoo! Mail takes over
   Outlook.comôs long-held #7 spot. Thunderbird replaces AOL Mail in #10
   spot.</p> <h4>September</h4> <p>Mobile opens surpass the 50% mark,
   while webmail opens dip to 28% and desktop opens dip to 21%. iOS 9 and
   Outlook 2016 are launched.</p> <h4>October</h4> <p>After the launch of
   Outlook 2016 in September, Outlook replaces Apple Mail for the #5 spot.
   However, it doesnôt last longîApple Mail climbs back up to #5 spot in
   November and stays put the rest of the year.</p> <h4>November</h4>
   <p>Mobile opens jump from 52% to 54%. This is likely a result of
   holiday shoppers reading their emails on-the-go. AOL Mail replaces
   Thunderbird at #10 spot. After more than two months in rotation, iOS 9
   adoption grows quickly and accounts for 72% of all iOS opens.</p>
   <h4>December</h4> <p>Mobile opens continue to rise and reach 55%.
   Thunderbird ends the year in the top 10, beating out AOL Mail for the
   last spot on the list.</p> <p><em>*Our 2015 market share data is

   Define It</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow"
   href="https://litmus.com/blog">Litmus Blog</a>.</p> <p>About a month
   ago, a friend and fellow Boston marketer and I got into a discussion
   about the merits of customer marketing, and more specifically, how
   email plays a role. </p> <p>Casey Hogan was frustrated, as she had just
   received her tenthî<em>tenth!</em>îupsell email from a brand that she had
   been using for four years.</p> <p>Obviously annoyed, she took to
   Twitter in search of empathy. </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"
   data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CX in need of upgrade:<br />1 Use
   code for 1st X free îè<br />2 Refer friends, get $ îè<br />3 Refer friends,
   get $ &#8230;îè<br />4 Refer friends, get $ &#8230;..</p> <p>&mdash;
   Casey Hogan (@hogan) <a
   href="https://twitter.com/hogan/status/675100750415007746">December 10,
   2015</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async
   src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>
   <p>Asked by another user to clarify, she went on:</p> <blockquote
   class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a
   href="https://twitter.com/netspencer">@netspencer</a> Not a great
   experience for a long time user.</p> <p>&mdash; Casey Hogan (@hogan) <a
   href="https://twitter.com/hogan/status/675102622148374528">December 10,
   2015</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async
   src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
   <p>I added my .02 cents&#8230;</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"
   data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a
   href="https://twitter.com/hogan">@hogan</a> <a
   href="https://twitter.com/netspencer">@netspencer</a> Hate when email
   is used exclusively as leverage in a relationship rather than a
   relationship itself : (</p> <p>&mdash; John Bonini (@Bonini84) <a
   href="https://twitter.com/Bonini84/status/675107643833339906">December
   11, 2015</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async
   src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
   <p>&#8230;and the inspiration for this post was born. </p> <p>For <a
   href="https://twitter.com/hogan" target="_blank">Hogan</a>, formerly a
   marketer at <a href="http://www.drift.com/" target="_blank">Drift</a>
   and <a href="https://drizly.com/" target="_blank">Drizly</a>, the
   customer experience is something of great personal meaning. And like
   anything else worth analogizing, she related her experience to
   dating:</p> <blockquote><p>úGetting a subscriber is just like getting
   someone&#8217;s number&#8230;Most people don&#8217;t want to hear from
   someone they just met three times a day. I would also guess they
   don&#8217;t want to sporadically hear òhey can you set me up with your
   friends?ô either.ù</p></blockquote> <p>Conversely, by permission
   marketing standards, all seems fair. But when we consider how
   subscribersô rising expectations has worked to evolve what email spam
   really is, her frustration comes into focus.</p> <p>A friend and
   colleague of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/chadswhite"
   target="_blank">Chad White</a>, writes in his book <a
   href="http://www.amazon.com/Email-Marketing-Rules-Step-Step/dp/15009819
   74" target="_blank"><em>Email Marketing Rules</em></a> that úHaving
   permission only gets you so far nowadays. Irrelevant and unwanted email
   is the new spam in the eyes of both consumers and Internet Service
   Providers (ISPs).ù</p> <h2>How your customers define email spam</h2>
   <p>Whiteôs definition above is whiteboard material. </p> <p>Your
   customers view any irrelevant or unwanted email as spam. It doesnôt
   matter how long theyôve been a customer or if theyôve given you
   permissionîif your email is repeatedly of little to no relevance to
   them, itôs spam. </p> <p>Or, as was the case mentioned earlier, this
   particular brand was more interested in using Hogan to create new
   relationships than actually building a relationship with her. As
   detailed by Hogan, the customer experience looked something like
   this:</p> <ul> <li>Use code for first X free</li> <li>Refer friends,
   get $</li> <li>Refer friends, get $ ..</li> <li>Refer friends, get $
   &#8230;.</li> <li>Refer friends, get $ &#8230;..</li> </ul>
   <p>&#8230;and so on. Ten times. </p> <p>There was obviously no
   relevance for the user, otherwise she wouldnôt have taken to Twitter to
   voice her frustrations. But how are brands to define relevance? As
   White says in Email Marketing Rules, úitôs often discussed in vague,
   mystical terms.ù </p> <p>In an attempt to lift the veil a bit, Iôve
   detailed some ways Iôve found effective at ensuring a more relevant
   experience for subscribers.</p> <h2>Set the right expectations</h3>
   <p>This section is really about table stakes. If your subscribers arenôt
   sure of what kinds of communications to expect, youôve exposed yourself
   to the risk of being reported as spam, thus hurting your subscriber
   reputation and any future hopes of landing in the inbox.</p> <p>So
   tables stakes or not, itôs important to note here. </p> <p>Sign up forms
   and welcome emails are two areas of prime real estate you should use to
   clearly inform people what they will be receiving from your brand. </p>
   <p>If you plan on emailing occasional gated material, let people know
   in advance of them providing their email address. Whether or not you
   view additional communications as a value add is irrelevant, both to
   this principle and to your subscribers.</p> <p>Let subscribers of any
   list know ahead of time exactly what they can expect to receive from
   your brand. Then, most importantly, reduce your messaging to specific
   lists to the content they expect to receive. </p> <h2>Personalize the
   subject matter, not the subject</h2> <p>Advances in marketing
   technology has resulted in a misconception of what personalization
   really is, and more unfortunately, in marketers abusing the tactics
   available for achieving faux personalization. </p> <p>So letôs start
   with what personalization is not. Itôs not:</p> <ul> <li>Knowing your
   subscriber&#8217;s name, or</li> <li>Location</li> <li>Company
   name</li> <li>Job title</li> <li>Industry, or any other basic
   demographic information</li> </ul> <p>Personalization is about
   interests, behavior, and challenges. And while most brands can talk
   about these characteristics in detail as they pertain to their target
   audience, many do not tailor the email marketing strategy to
   communicate the right messages to those who need it most. </p> <p>Letôs
   use an example from my own inbox. </p> <p>I joined the <a
   href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/" target="_blank">Dollar Shave
   Club</a> last fall, and right before my first box shipped, I received
   an email with the subject line, úYour first box is about to ship. Toss
   more in.ù </p> <p>This was pretty pertinent information for me.
   Naturally, I opened.</p> <p>Inside were four product suggestions,
   including a shave butter I had never tried. I wouldnôt normally purchase
   shave butter, but at $4.99, I thought, úWhy not? One less thing I have
   to remember at the store.ù </p> <p>Dollar Shave Club knows this about me
   (and all its users): we value convenience over features. Their razors
   donôt have 8 blades, a battery, or other gimmicks. Itôs just a razor. But
   theyôre delivered to the doorstep every month, for less than weôd pay in
   the store. </p> <blockquote><p>Convenience over
   features.</p></blockquote> <p>This email, from the subject line through
   the body copy, stayed consistent with this message. Thatôs
   personalization. They didn&#8217;t need to use my name anywhere in the
   email. Instead, they know why I buy from them and use this to improve
   my experience and increase sales. </p> <p>Now, this was a more general
   form of personalization. Most automation software enables you to
   collect more relevant, personal information on your customers and
   prospects. Not only should you be gathering information around buyer
   interests, behaviors, preferences, purchase history, and more, you
   should also be powering your personalization efforts with the insights
   you glean from it.</p> <h2>User-friendly</h2> <p>Your subscribers are
   viewing email on a variety of different apps and devices, each with its
   own rendering quirks that affect the way your email looks and performs.
   </p> <p>These are challenges your marketing and design teams face.</p>
   <p>From your customerôs standpoint, their challenge is that it may be
   really hard to read your email on mobile, or that your call-to-action
   isnôt úclickableù on whichever device they happen to be using. Or maybe
   itôs that some (or all) the images used are broken, or your links are
   broken or leading to the wrong page. </p> <p>Poor user experience leads
   to frustration, which as shown in the opening, could also lead to
   declarations of spam. </p> <h2>Utility</h2> <p>While most marketers
   believe that what they produce and send is of value to their customers,
   in order to truly be of utility to your customers, you need to think in
   their terms rather than your own. </p> <p>Besides using customer
   intelligence to segment your messaging (discussed earlier), White lists
   two other ways that email marketers can execute greater value and
   utility in their strategies: worthwhile and engaging messaging. </p>
   <h3>Worthwhile</h3> <p>Discounts, deals, and buyer-related information
   are the number one reason people sign up for emails. This aligns
   perfectly with David Ogilvyôs summation that, more than anything, people
   care about saving money.</p> <p>However, be careful as to use these
   motivations as a means to take advantage of your customers. As
   evidenced in the opening, many brands essentially hold their customers
   ransom with discounts and deals. </p> <p>In other words, they follow
   the formula of úif you perform [x], weôll allow you to save [y].ù </p>
   <p>Could it also be possible that úperforming [x]ù aligns with a
   buyer&#8217;s interests while also appealing to their motivation to
   save money? Sure. But be careful, as thereôs a very thin line in
   appealing to a customerôs motivation and holding them ransom.</p>
   <h3>Engaging</h3> <p>Chances are a sizeable portionîif not the
   majorityîof your email list is not made up of customers, but
   prospectsîprospects who are not yet ready to buy, but would benefit from
   educational materials that pertain to their specific needs and
   challenges. </p> <p>Hereôs where the intelligence youôve gathered about
   your prospectsîand the subsequent segmentationîcome into play in order to
   deliver the right content to the right people. The úspray and prayù
   approach is not only less effective, itôs also less valuable to your
   subscribers. </p> <p>You may find yourself sending multiple variations
   of an email, thus spreading your reach across several emails rather
   than one, in order to achieve this, but you may also find yourself with
   higher engagement as a result. </p> <h2>Email spam redefined</h2>
   <p>Your subscribers donôt think in terms of algorithms, they think in
   terms of relevance. </p> <p>While ISP algorithms and content filtering
   are a critical component of ensuring your emails even make it to the
   inbox, your sender reputation and level of subscriber engagement are
   even more important when it comes to optimizing for the inbox. </p>
   <p>Itôs time marketers redefined how they define email spam, because
   their customers and prospects already have.</p> <h2>GET THE LATEST
