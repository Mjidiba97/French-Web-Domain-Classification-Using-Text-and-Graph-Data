   Healthy avocado toast is super easy to make and makes the perfect
   addition to any breakfast or an anytime snack!
   Healthy 5 Minute Avocado Toast Avocado toast has become my new favorite
   breakfast/snack. It’s healthy, simple, and delicious and best of all,
   it’s super easy to make and ready in under 5 minutes. In fact, this
   recipe is so simple we can hardly call it a recipe, but I had to share
   it with you because of how good it is!

   This recipe is for simple avocado toast but the possibilities are
   endless. Sometimes we like to zest up the avocado toast and top it with
   tomatoes, bacon, beans, jalapeno, spinach, salmon, or pretty much
   anything else!
   Healthy 5 Minute Avocado Toast To begin, simply toast your bread; You
   can use any kind of toast or sliced bread you have but I like to use
   crusty bread or whole grain toast.  Next, mash an avocado in a small
   bowl with a fork. Add cilantro, lime, and salt + pepper then spread the
   mixture on the toasted slice of bread. Sprinkle with pepper flakes and
   serve!

   If you’re having it for breakfast go ahead and top the avocado with an
   egg cooked any way you like. Our favorite is a sunny side up but
   poached, scrambled or even hard-boiled also works well.

   I love avocado toast. My recipe is avocado mashed I bowl with lemon
   juice, garlic POWER, onion flakes, hot pepper flakes, salt and pepper.
   Spread thick on toasted bread of MY choice. It’s delicious. I don’t
   like eggs so I omit those.

   Lime does not add a “salty taste”… It’s sour, slightly sweet.
   Completely different.

   Can you make the spread ahead of time then reuse it for a few mornings
   during the week?

       You can but the avocado will brown at the very top. You can try
       covering it tightly with a thin layer of plastic wrap. I would
       suggest making it fresh daily.

   I made this yesterday for brunch and it was so delicious. I sauteed
   fresh, herbal seasoned mushrooms and topped them with it. It was
   heavenly! I would have to keep avocados out of my house to avoid eating
   this everyday. Loved it!! Thanks for the recipe!

       I would adjust the salt and pepper to taste or omit the salt all
       together because the lime adds a salty taste.

   Thinly sliced zucchini dusted in breadcrumbs and baked until crispy and
   golden is a great alternative to potato fries with less than half the
   carbs and calories!
   The Best Crispy Baked Zucchini Fries As many of you have noticed from
   my instagram and snapchat, we don’t eat much fried food around here. I
   love baking everything instead of frying because it’s so much healthier
   and honestly, tastes just as good if not better.

   We’ve been experimenting a lot lately with healthier alternatives to
   the regular potatoes. We’ve tried the baked avocado fries, the baked
   sweet potato wedges, baked guacamole stuffed onion rings, and let’s not
   forget the baked broccoli and cauliflower tots. All these dishes are
   great alternatives to fries!
   The Best Crispy Baked Zucchini Fries Now it’s time for the long-awaited
   baked zucchini fries. They are crispy, crunchy, addictive and
   surprisingly easy to make!

   To begin, simple slice your zucchini into circles or long strips.
   Either way works fine but we prefer the strips! Next, dip the zucchini
   into eggs then into breadcrumbs. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden
   and crispy. Make sure you allow them to bake long enough until they are
   golden and crispy so they hold and not become soggy.

   I paired them with out favorite chipotle sauce but any other sauce or
   ketchup will work great as well!  The Best Crispy Baked Zucchini Fries

   Super yummy. I cut the carbs and only used half the amount of
   breadcrumbs and doubled the permesan cheese. This helped the breeding
   stay on and weren’t as bulky. Also more tasty.: )

   I used a very large zucchini fresh from the garden. Really tasty. As
   others have said, they aren’t quite as crispy as they appear in the
   photo. Still, very tasty we ate the whole batch for dinner.

   One suggestion in breading the zucchini strips. I found that about half
   way through breading the egg soaked strips, the panko became fairly
   full of egg and wouldn’t stick very well to the zucchini. Next time I
   make these, and believe me there will be many next times, I think I
   might sprinkle the panko over the strips rather than dredge them in the
   panko.
   Reply

Denise

   Tried this with good results, with a few changes. First I used whisked
   egg whites only and discarded the yolks. I only used seasoned panko.
   Then I used non-fat cooking spray. Olive oil isn’t meant for high heat
   because it has a low smoke point (burns easily). I sprayed the pan and
   then a light spray over the zucchini once it was arranged on the pan. I
   noticed that mine came out more golden and less burnt than the picture.
   Will definitely be adding this one to the rotation.

       Non-fat cooking spray? What fresh magic is this?

   Unlike most people rating these, I actually made them. They weren’t as
   crispy as I’d hoped with the breadcrumbs. Panko would probably have
   worked better. Other than that, this is a solid recipe.

   I made these yesterday to go with some pizza. I put parm cheese, garlic
   powder, and some Italian seasoning into the breading and used some
   Prego Traditional sauce as the dipping sauce. Delicious but not quite
   crispy enough for me. They were still kinda soft and fell apart easily
   sometimes. I baked them at the specified time and temp but I was baking
   them from the center rack. Should I bake them on a different rack level
   in the oven?

       if that much sodium is in its not good for you. because that should
       not be that high in salt that is enough salt in there to kill you

   Great recipe. I made a version of this today as a side for my veggie
   burger at lunch. I cut out the olive oil and parm, added some chipotle
   spice and black pepper, and used Egg Beaters instead of eggs to save
   some fat. Turned out great! You’re right, making sure not to take them
   out too soon is key! Thanks for the recipe and the inspiration.

   Spiced up queso chicken dip packed with chicken, beans, jalapeno, and
   lots of cheese. Plus, it’s made easy all in your slow cooker. Slow
   Cooker Queso Chicken Dip One of my favorite things to serve as a snack
   is chips and dip. Queso is our favorite dip because it’s creamy, cheese
   and gooey. Today, I’ve spiced up our favorite queso dip with chicken,
   beans, jalapeno, tomatoes and lots of cheese. Plus, it’s super easy to
   make and all done in your slow cooker so it can be made ahead of time
   and is ready whenever you need it! Slow Cooker Queso Chicken Dip I used
   two 8 0z Crystal Farms® Cheddar Cheese blocks diced into cubes. The
   cheese melts and makes the perfect gooey queso for dipping! I usually
   find Crystal Farms® cheese at my local shoppers but it can also be
   found at Acme. Today the Crystal Farms® brand is one of the largest
   cheese brands in the country. Lake Mills, Wisconsin has been home to
   Crystal Farms for the past 25 years and the hard-working, honest people
   of Lake Mills are devoted to delivering consistent quality and great
   tasting products for what they love – cheese. They are natural products
   with few preservatives, are a rich source of calcium, gluten-free and
   lactose tolerant! Slow Cooker Queso Chicken Dip To begin simply toss
   all the ingredients in your slow cooker and slow cook for 2 hours or
   until everything is gooey and incorporated. To get the perfect cheesy
   texture I like to use mild or sharp cheddar cheese along with
   cream-cheese or sour-cream as a low-fat option. Slow Cooker Queso
   Chicken Dip Slow Cooker Queso Chicken Dip The result is gooey and
   cheesy taco chicken dip that is out of this world! All that’s needed to
   make this a perfect meal is some tortilla chips or tortillas. Slow
