Privacy policy

   Effective as of May 25, 2018

   Introduction

   Protecting your privacy and right to choice is a top priority for
   Zemanta. Zemanta is a global provider of advertising technology to
   advertisers and agencies. This privacy policy explains Zemanta’s
   collection and use of data on websites where Zemanta’s proprietary
   Zemanta DSP technology is used to purchase ads (also known as “Zemanta
   One”). This privacy policy does not govern the collection and use of
   data on Zemanta’s corporate web site (https://www.zemanta.com). That
   data is governed by the section “Site Visitors”, found at
   https://www.outbrain.com/legal/privacy#privacy-policy, which is
   operated by Zemanta’s parent company, Outbrain Inc.

   Zemanta is a member of IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) and adheres
   to its policies around online consumer privacy. While not a member,
   Zemanta adheres to Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct
   self-regulatory principles.

   Information We Collect Through Our Technology

   When you visit a website or application that uses the Zemanta One
   platform for targeted ads, we collect certain information about you and
   your device to help optimize ads and increase the likelihood that will
   be interested in an ad shown. Some of this information, including for
   example, your IP addresses and certain unique device identifiers, may
   identify a particular computer or device, and may be considered
   “personal data” in some jurisdictions in the European Union and
   elsewhere.

   Information that we may collect includes: IP address, domain, browser
   type and language, referring website addresses, date/time of visits,
   page view data, search keywords, your activities and actions on
   publisher’s sites, browser history, Internet service provider,
   referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, geolocation
   (including city, country, zip code, and geographic coordinates, if you
   have enabled location services on your device), click data, types of
   advertisements viewed, and information about your device including
   device make, device model, device operating system, device operating
   system version, and data connection type. We do not collect any
   “sensitive personal data” as defined under European data protection
   laws.

   We may also collect information about our partners’ interactions with
   you—for example, by placing pixels on an advertiser’s webpage so we can
   know if you ultimately purchased an item after viewing an advertisement
   bought through our platform or by integrating with the partners’ web
   analytics software, so we can know how long and where you engaged on
   their site. We may partner with other companies that are permitted to
   share anonymous information with us in order to enhance audience
   profiles. For example, we may partner with companies to learn the kinds
   of products you buy or express interest in.

   How we collect information

   We collect information in industry standard ways, including:

   Cookies – Cookies are short strings of characters. Zemanta uses cookies
   to uniquely identify an internet browser and in turn a device. We sync
   those cookies with our partners, so we can identify users across
   environments and know which segments our partners identify them with.
   For more information about cookies, visit
   http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.

   Pixel Tags – Pixel tags are transparent images or short snippets of
   Javascript that our partners and clients use to understand how their
   users interact with their properties online, including websites and
   mobile apps.

   Mobile Advertising Identifiers – Mobile advertising IDs (like IDFA) are
   unique, non PII IDs associated with individual mobile devices. Users
   can reset them by instructing their device to do so.

   General Web Analytics – We integrate with Web Analytics software of our
   clients and partners in order to observe how users behave after
   clicking on ads. We do not control how third party Web Analytics
   software collects the data as this is defined by its own privacy
   policy.

   How we use the information we collect

   We primarily use the information we collect to enable our partners and
   clients to buy appropriate advertising space across the Zemanta One
   platform, which allows buying advertisements on the web and in desktop
   and mobile apps.

   This information is used to target ads to consumers on behalf of our
   advertisers. This means displaying ads that might be of interest to
   consumers sharing certain traits. In some cases, our data is used in
   conjunction with the information advertisers have collected themselves
   (for example by bringing their CRM data into Zemanta One platform).
   This information is also used to appropriately price the ads on behalf
   of our advertisers.

   Zemanta and its third-party partners may disclose links to or the
   entirety of articles you read, and in connection therewith, you waive
   any rights you may have under the California Reader Privacy Protection
   Act, the United States Video Privacy Protection Act, and any similar
   federal, state, local, or foreign law. Third parties may be able to
   ascertain your identity by using information we disclose to them in
   anonymized form in conjunction with other information they may have.
   Data retention

   Cookies that are used to identify browsers expire after one year or
   less on a user’s machine. Likewise, data Zemanta One platform retains
   about those identifiers is retained for 90 days. Log level data of
   served ads, such as IP address and date an ad is served may be retained
   indefinitely.

   Zemanta also maintains a Data Retention Policy that details the
   retention period for personal data based on our analysis of how long
   the specific data is reasonably required for legal or business
   purposes. When we no longer need personal data, we securely delete or
   destroy it. Aggregated data, which cannot identify a device/browser (or
   individual) and is used for purposes of reporting and analysis, is
   maintained for as long as commercially necessary.

   Consumer Choice: Opt-Out

   Opt out means you inform Zemanta One platform that you wish Zemanta to
   delete the data it holds about your browser and cease collecting data
   while you remain opted-out (which means a non-unique opt-out cookie is
   set in your browser).

   In practice, this means Zemanta One platform will not have and
   therefore will not be able to use any information specific to your
   browser to deliver targeted ads to you.

   Please note that you will still see ads if you opt out, they just won’t
   be interest-based or otherwise targeted based on your browser’s cookie.

   You can opt out on this page: https://www.zemanta.com/opt-out

   Additionally, you can reset your Mobile Advertising Identifiers on your
   mobile device by following instructions for iOS devices and for Android
   Devices.

   Information Our Customers Collect

   Our customers and other third parties who use our technology may use
   their own tags, pixels, cookies, or other similar technology (or those
   of their other affiliates) within their advertisements and on certain
   websites. These customers maintain their own privacy policies and
   processes. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of
   customers that use our technology.

   Children

   None of our services are directed to children under 16. We do not
   knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 16 years of age. If
   we determine upon collection that you are under 16, we will not use or
   maintain your personal data. If we become aware that we have
   unknowingly collected personal data from a child under the age of 16,
   we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our
   records. If you’re a kid, please go play in the yard, don’t use or
   interact with Zemanta!

   European Territory Citizens

   In compliance with European privacy laws, in particular, the European
   General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Zemanta provides specific
   additional rights for citizens of the European Territories such as the
   right to access, rectification, right to object, to complaint, erasure
   and blockage. More specifically:
     * The right to request information about whether and which personal
       data is processed by our company, and the right to demand that
       personal data is rectified or amended.
     * Under certain circumstances, the right to request that personal
       data should be deleted.
     * Under certain circumstances, the right to demand that the
       processing of personal data should be restricted.
     * Withdraw your consent to the processing and use of your data
       completely or partially at any time with future application.
       have the right to obtain your personal data in a common, structured
       and mechanically readable format.
     * Contact your data protection officer if there are any questions,
       comments, complaints or requests in connection with our statement
       on data protection and the processing of your personal data.
     * The right to complain to the responsible supervisory authority if
       believed that the processing of your personal data is in violation
       of the legislation.

   In addition to the above, we reference certain rights for European
   Territory citizens throughout this Privacy Policy. Pursuant to the
   GDPR, citizens from “European Territories” mean the European Economic
   Area (EEA) and Switzerland. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, the
   term “European Territories” shall continue to include the United
   Kingdom, even after the United Kingdom leaves the European Economic
   Area following Brexit.

   California Privacy Rights

   Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California
   residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what
   categories of personal information we share with third parties or
   corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates’
   direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of
   information shared and will include a list of the third parties and
   affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and
   addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of
   this notice, please submit a written request to
   info+privacy@zemanta.com or send to the following address: Zemanta
   Inc., 39 West 13th Street, 3rd floor, New York, NY 10011. Please allow
   30 days for a response.

   “Do Not Track” Disclosure

   Some browsers transmit Do Not Track (DNT) signals to websites. Because
   there is no common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal,
   Zemanta does not currently alter, change, or respond to DNT requests or
   signals from these browsers. We will continue to monitor industry
   activity in this area and reassess our DNT practices as necessary. In
   the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to
   control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out in
   the Consumer Choice: Opt-Out section.

   Changes to this privacy policy

   Zemanta may update this privacy policy at any time (on a prospective
   basis). When we do, we will post an updated version here, and indicate
   the date of revision at the top of this page. We may, but are not
   required to, give you notice through other means. We encourage you to
   frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how
   we are helping to protect the information we collect.
