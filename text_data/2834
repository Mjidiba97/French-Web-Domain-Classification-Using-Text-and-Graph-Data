Who uses this Settings Manager?

   Beginning with Flash Player 10.3, the Local Settings Manager supersedes
   this Online Settings Manager for managing global settings on Windows,
   Mac, and Linux computers. The Local Settings Manager can be accessed in
   the Control Panel on Windows and in System Preferences on Mac. Users of
   other operating systems and earlier versions of Flash Player can
   continue to use the Online Settings Manager described here.

   To access the local Flash Player Settings Manager that is native to
   your operating system:
     * Windows: click Start > Settings > Control Panel > Flash Player
     * Macintosh: System Preferences (under Other) click Flash Player
     * Linux Gnome: System > Preferences > Adobe Flash Player
     * Linux KDE: System Settings > Adobe Flash Player

   To access Help for the local Settings Manager, click any of the
   individual Learn more…. links on the Settings Manager tabs, or click

What can I do with the Settings Manager?

   Adobe is committed to providing you with options to control SWF or FLV
   content and applications that run in Adobe Flash Player. The Flash
   Player Settings Manager lets you manage global privacy settings,
   storage settings, and security settings, by using the following panels:
     * To specify whether websites must ask your permission before using
       your camera or microphone, you use the Global Privacy Settings
       panel.
     * To specify the amount of disk space that websites you haven't yet
       visited can use to store information on your computer, or to
       prevent websites you haven't yet visited from storing information
       on your computer, you use the Global Storage Settings panel.
     * To view or change your security settings, you use the Global
       Security Settings panel.
     * To specify if and how often Flash Player should check for updated
       versions, you use the Global Notifications Settings panel.
     * To view or change the privacy settings for websites you have
       already visited, you use the Website Privacy Settings panel.
     * To view or change the storage settings for websites you have
       already visited, or to delete information that any or all websites
       have already stored on your computer, you use the Website Storage
       Settings panel.
     * To view or change protected media settings, you use the Protected
       Content Playback Settings panel.
     * To view or change peer-assisted networking settings, you use the
       Peer-Assisted Networking panel.

How do I get to the Settings Manager?

   The Settings Manager is a special control panel that runs on your local
   computer but is displayed within and accessed from the Adobe website.
   Adobe does not have access to the settings that you see in the Settings
   Manager or to personal information on your computer.

   Click the links below to open the specific Settings Manager panel that
   you want. The Settings Manager that you see on the page is not an
   image; it is the actual Settings Manager. To change your settings,
   click the tabs to see different panels, and then click the options in
   the Settings Manager panels that you see on the web page.
     * Global Privacy Settings panel
     * Global Storage Settings panel
     * Global Security Settings panel
     * Global Notifications Settings panel
     * Website Privacy Settings panel
     * Website Storage Settings panel
     * Protected Content Playback Settings panel
     * Peer-Assisted Networking panel

   The settings in the Settings Manager apply to all websites that contain
   SWF or FLV content, rather than just a specific website.

What are privacy settings?

   Applications that run in Flash Player may want to have access to the
   camera and/or microphone available on your computer. Privacy settings
   let you specify whether you want applications from a particular website
   to have such access. Note that it is the person or company that has
   created the application you are using that is requesting such access,
   not Adobe (unless Adobe has created the application that wants access
   to your camera or microphone).

   It is the responsibility of the person or company requesting access to
   make it clear to you why they want access and how they plan to use the
   audio or video. You should be aware of the privacy policy of anyone who
   is requesting audio or video access. For example, see the Adobe privacy
   policy. Contact the website requesting access for information on their
   privacy policy.

   It's important to understand that even though this settings panel is
   part of Flash Player, the audio and video will be used by an
   application created by a third party. Adobe assumes no responsibility
   for third-party privacy policies, actions of third-party companies in
   capturing audio or video on your computer, or such companies' use of
   such data or information.

   To specify privacy settings for all websites, use the Global Privacy
   Settings panel. To specify privacy settings for individual websites,
   use the Website Privacy Settings panel.

What are storage settings?

   Applications that run in Flash Player may want to store some
   information on your computer, but the amount they can store is limited
   to 100 kilobytes unless you agree to allocate additional space. Local
   storage settings let you specify how much disk space, if any,
   applications from a particular website can use to store information on
   your computer. Note that it is the person or company that has created
   the application you are using that is requesting such access, not Adobe
   (unless Adobe has created the application that wants to save the
   information). It is the responsibility of the person or company
   requesting access to make it clear to you why they want access and how
   they plan to use the information they save. You should be aware of the
   privacy policy of anyone who is requesting access to your computer. For
   example, see the Adobe privacy policy. Contact the website requesting
   access for information on their privacy policy.

   It's important to understand that even though this settings panel is
   part of Flash Player, the information will be used by an application
   created by a third party. Adobe assumes no responsibility for
   third-party privacy policies, actions of third-party companies in
   storing information on your computer, or such companies' use of such
   data or information.

   To specify storage settings for websites you haven't yet visited, use
   the Global Storage Settings panel. To specify storage settings for
   websites you have already visited, use the Website Storage Settings
   panel.

What are security settings?

   Adobe has designed Flash Player to provide security settings that do
   not require you to explicitly allow or deny access in most situations.
   Over time, as SWF and FLV content have become more sophisticated, Flash
   Player has also become more sophisticated, offering users additional
   privacy and security protections. However, you might occasionally
   encounter older SWF or FLV content that was created using older
   security rules. In these cases, Flash Player asks you to make a
   decision: You can allow the content to work as its creator intended,
   using the older security rules, or you can choose to enforce the newer,
   stricter rules. The latter choice helps ensure that you only view or
   play content that meets the most recent standards of security, but it
   may sometimes prevent older SWF or FLV content from working properly.

   When older content runs in a newer version of the player, and Flash
   Player needs you to make a decision about enforcing newer rules or not,
   you may see one of the following pop-up dialog boxes. These dialog
   boxes ask your permission before allowing the older SWF or FLV content
   to communicate with other locations on the Internet:
     * A dialog box might appear alerting you that the SWF or FLV content
       you are using is trying to use older security rules to access
       information from a site outside its own domain and that information
       might be shared between two sites. Flash Player asks if you want to
       allow or deny such access.
       In addition to responding to the dialog box, you can use the Global
       Security Settings panel to specify if Flash Player should always
       ask for your permission, through the dialog box, before allowing
       access; always deny access, without asking first; or always allow
       access to other sites or domains without asking your permission.
     * (Flash Player 8 and later) If you have downloaded SWF or FLV
       content to your computer, a dialog box might appear alerting you
       that the content is trying to communicate with the Internet. Flash
       Player 8 and later versions do not allow the local SWF or FLV
       content to communicate with the Internet, by default.
       Using the Global Security Settings panel, you can specify that
       certain applications that run in Flash Player on your computer may
       communicate with the Internet.

   To change your security settings or learn more about your options, see
   the Global Security Settings panel.

What are protected content playback settings?

   Some content on the Internet is protected by the content provider using
   Adobe Flash Access. To enjoy this protected content, users must first
   get content licenses from the content provider. These content licenses
   are automatically downloaded to your computer, for example, when you
   rent or purchase the protected content. Flash Player saves these
   licenses on your computer.
   To manage or deactivate these licenses, use the Protected Content
   Playback Settings panel.

What are peer-assisted networking settings?

   A website that serves audio and video to your computer can deliver the
   content with better performance if users who are playing the same
   content share their bandwidth. Sharing bandwidth allows the audio or
   video to play more smoothly, without skips or pauses from buffering.
   This is called peer-assisted networking, since peers on the network
   assist each other to provide a better experience. Flash Player only
   shares bandwidth using peer-assisted networking with your permission.

   If you enable this option, you are not agreeing to share your bandwidth
   whenever an application wants to use it. You are only allowing
   applications to ask you whether you want to share your bandwidth. In
   most cases, you want to share your bandwidth only when you are using a
   high-speed Internet connection.

   Note that sharing your bandwidth increases the amount of data your
   network provider delivers to your device. If you pay a flat monthly fee
   for unlimited network data, using peer-assisted networking won't
   increase your monthly bill.

   However, if you pay for a limited amount of data or are unsure how you
   are charged for network usage, you probably want to disable
   peer-assisted networking. If you do so, you will never be asked whether
   you want to share your bandwidth.

   To specify whether or not to use peer-assisted networking, use the
   Peer-Assisted Networking panel.

If I've already set privacy and disk space options in my browser, do I need
to do it again?

   You may be aware that some websites work together with your browser to
   store small amounts of data, called cookies, on your computer for their
   own use in the future. For example, when you go to a website regularly,
   it may welcome you by name; your name is probably stored in a cookie,
   and you can use browser options to determine whether you want cookies
   or not. You may also have specified in your browser that pages you
   visit can take up only a certain amount of disk space.

   When SWF or FLV content is being played, the settings you select for
   Flash Player are used in place of options you may have set in your
   browser. That is, even if you have specified in your browser settings
   that you do not want cookies placed on your computer, you may be asked
   if an application that runs in Flash Player can store information. This
   happens because the information stored by Flash Player is not the same
   as a cookie; it is used only by the application and has no relation to
   any other Internet privacy or security settings you may have set in
   your browser.

   Similarly, the amount of disk space you let the application use has no
   relation to the amount of disk space you have allotted for stored pages
   in your browser. That is, when SWF or FLV content is being played, the
   amount of disk space you allow here is in addition to any space your
   browser is using for stored pages.

   No matter how you may have configured your browser, you still have the
   option to allow or deny the application that runs in Flash Player
   permission to store the information and to specify how much disk space
   the stored information can occupy.
