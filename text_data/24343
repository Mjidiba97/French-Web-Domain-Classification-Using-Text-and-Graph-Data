Samba TV Privacy Policy

   The purpose of Samba TV’s Privacy Policy is to explain how you can
   control the personal data we collect. We built our products to improve
   television and that includes empowering you to make decisions about
   your privacy. Samba TV continuously strives to follow the Golden Rule:
   we handle your data in the same way we would expect ours to be handled.

   Last Updated: October 26, 2018

   We, Free Stream Media Corp. and our affiliates and subsidiaries
   (collectively “Samba TV”, “Samba”, “we”, “us” or “our”), know you care
   about how your information is used and shared. This Privacy Policy (or
   “Policy”) describes our practices, including your choices, regarding
   the information we collect.

   This Policy applies to all of our products and services (“Samba
   Services” or the “Services”).  Our Services include Samba Interactive
   TV and other Smart TV apps (“Smart TV Services”), our websites (e.g.
   www.samba.tv), and our mobile apps (e.g. Samba TV Mobile).  Our
   Services also include our products and services that may be integrated
   into third-party websites, mobile apps and Smart TV apps (“Integrated
   Services”).

   Your privacy matters to Samba TV. If you have any questions please
   contact us at privacy@samba.tv or as described below in the Contact Us
   section.

Collection of Information

Information You Provide to Us

   We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we
   collect information when you create an account, update your profile,
   participate in certain interactive features of the Services, fill out a
   form, request customer support, or communicate with us. The types of
   information we collect may include your name, email address, phone
   number, interests and preferences, location, and other information you
   choose to provide.

   If you provide personal information to us about someone else, you must
   ensure that you are entitled to disclose that information to us,
   including having had obtained any necessary consent on his or her part;
   and, that we may collect, use, and disclose such information for the
   purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Any collection and
   processing of information that you have provided about another person
   will be in accordance with this Policy.

Information We Get When You Use Our Services

   We collect information about the Services you or your household use and
   how they are used, such as when you watch a video on Hotlist, visit a
   third-party website or app that uses our Integrated Services, or
   interact with our ads and content.  This information includes:
     * Log Information:
       We automatically collect standard log files when you use our
       Services, which include the time and date of access, pages or
       features viewed, IP address, the type of web browser you use, and
       the referral URL.
     * Device Information:
       We collect information about the devices you use to interact with
       our Services. This device-specific information may include the
       hardware model and brand, operating system, device identifiers,
       resource usage, and error logs. We may also discover when your
       Smart TV is available to connect with a mobile device, which can,
       for example, be used to make pairing your devices easier.
     * Content Viewing Information:
       We receive information about the content you view and interact with
       through a Smart TV that integrates our Smart TV Services or through
       Smart TV Apps (“Content Viewing Information”). Content Viewing
       Information includes things like the title of the content, actions
       taken while viewing the content, and the length of time you viewed
       it.
       We receive this information in two principal ways:
          + Smart TV Apps: We may receive such viewing information when
            you use our Smart TV Apps or third-party Smart TV apps that
            use our Integrated Services.
          + Smart TV Services: When you opt-in to our Smart TV Services,
            we may recognize the content played through your TV.  Please
            note, we are only able to recognize public content, such as
            certain shows and movies. We won’t know when you’re watching,
            for example, home videos.
     * Precise Location Information:
       With your consent, we may collect information about the precise
       location of your device, including when you access or use one of
       our mobile apps or an app that uses our Integrated Services.
     * Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies:
       We use various technologies to collect information when you
       interact with our Services. These technologies include cookies,
       local storage and web beacons. Cookies and local storage are small
       data files that are stored on your device when you visit a website.
       Cookies and local storage enable us and our customers to provide
       features and functionality (such as keeping you logged in), measure
       the popularity of our Services, and monitor their performance.
       Web beacons (or pixel tags) are electronic images that may be used
       in our Services or emails to help deliver cookies, count website
       visits, and determine the effectiveness of email marketing
       campaigns. Our cookies are set to expire twenty-four (24) months
       from the last time our systems encounter a particular computer or
       device.
     * Information from Integrated Services:
       We collect information when you visit or use third-party websites
       and apps that use our Integrated Services, including through the
       cookies and other technologies described above. For example, when
       you elect to pair a broadcaster’s app to your TV, that broadcaster
       can use our technology to synchronize your experience on their
       mobile apps as you watch a show on your TV. Also, third-party apps
       and websites can use our measurement and advertising services to
       better understand usage of their services and enable the delivery
       of interest-based advertisements. The information we collect
       includes information about your use of those websites and apps, as
       well as information those apps or websites enable us to collect
       from their services. For example, a streaming video provider may
       enable us to receive information about the content you watch so
       that our recommendation service can suggest additional content that
       you might like.
       You may opt out of providing information through our Integrated
       Services by following the instructions under the “Web and Mobile
       Apps” heading in the “Your Rights and Choices” section below.
     * Information We Collect from Other Sources:
       Where the law permits, we may also obtain information from other
       sources and combine that with information we collect through our
       Services. For example, we might obtain information from data
       providers and advertising exchange services, including assumed
       demographics and interests, and data about your engagement with our
       ads.
       Also, if you create or log into your Samba TV account through a
       social media service, we will have access to certain information
       from that service based on the settings and authorizations you
       grant us through that service.

Use of Information

   We may use the information we collect to:
     * Provide, maintain and improve our Services (for instance, we use
       information we collect to refine the user experience, fix service
       malfunctions, test our security systems and increase our technical
       performance);
     * Monitor and analyze usage of our Services;
     * Personalize our Services and deliver recommendations,
       advertisements, content and features that match your interests;
     * Improve our advertising and measurement systems so we can show you
       relevant ads on and off our Services (for example, if you are
       interested in cooking shows, we may serve you ads for new TV
       cooking programs);
     * Communicate with you about products, services, offers and events
       offered by Samba TV or others, and provide content we think you
       will find interesting;
     * Respond to your comments and questions and provide customer
       service; and,
     * Detect, investigate and prevent fraudulent and other illegal
       activities, and protect the rights, safety and property of Samba TV
       and others.

   To clarify, information we receive about you or your household from
   using one device or Smart TV may be combined with information we
   receive from use of other devices or Smart TVs. For example, if we know
   you love watching football on your Smart TV, we may show you real-time
   football stats on your mobile device. You may always opt out of
   receiving such tailored content on your household devices by following
   the instructions set forth in the “Your Rights and Choices” section
   below.

Sharing of Information

Information You Share

   When you submit a post to any interactive areas of our websites or
   apps, users of those services may be able to see the posts, your
   username and when you submitted the post.

   The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated
   tools — such as the Facebook “Like” button — which let you share
   actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. Your
   use of such features enables the sharing of information with your
   friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the
   company, and are subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of
   those companies.

Information We Share

   We may share the information we collect about you with third parties in
   the following circumstances:
     * With Your Consent or at Your Direction:
       At your direction or if we have your consent to do so, we will
       share information with companies, organizations or individuals
       outside of Samba TV. When you authorize us to share information
       about you with other companies, you should review their privacy
       policies to understand how they may use and treat your information.
     * With Vendors, Consultants, and Data Processors:
       We may share information with vendors, consultants and data
       processors, service providers and other trusted businesses who work
       on our behalf and make our business-to-business activities in
       digital advertising possible.
     * For Legal Reasons:
       We may share information with companies, organizations, or
       individuals outside of Samba TV: in response to a request for
       information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or
       required by, any applicable law, legal process or national security
       requirements; if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our
       user agreements; or, to protect the rights, property or safety of
       Samba or others.
     * With Our Corporate Family:
       We may share information between and among Samba TV’s current and
       future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under
       our common control and ownership. We rely on our legitimate
       interests to do so in order to administer and deliver our Services
       as described in this Policy.
       We may also share information in connection with any merger, sale
       of assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our
       business by another company.
     * When You are not Directly Identified:
       We may share certain information, such as Content Viewing
       Information, that does not, on its own, directly identify you as an
       individual. We may share this information with our partners and
       customers (including for advertising and analytics purposes), and
       the public. We may, for instance, publish aggregated reports
       regarding how many people viewed a particular TV show. Or, we may
       share data about your device with advertising platforms to help
       make the ads you see more relevant to you.
       To clarify, the personal information that we share will not
       directly identify you, but may indirectly identify you through, for
       example, your device or other means. The types of personal
       information we may share include device IDs, advertising IDs, IP
       addresses, hashed/encrypted versions of your email address or other
       identifier, or pseudonymous IDs.

Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others

   We engage other companies to serve advertisements on our behalf across
   the Internet and provide analytics services to us.

   These companies may use cookies, web beacons, device IDs and other
   technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and
   other websites and apps, including: your IP address, web browser, pages
   viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked and conversion
   information. This information may be used by Samba TV and others in
   various ways, including to analyze and track data, determine the
   popularity of certain features, deliver interest-based advertising and
   other content targeted to your interests on our Services and other
   websites, and to better understand your online activity.

Security

   Samba TV takes reasonable and appropriate security measures to help
   protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized
   access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

International Transfers

   Samba TV is striving to make our services available globally. We are
   based in the United States and currently have subsidiaries in the
   United Kingdom, Poland and Taiwan. In the future Samba TV may also
   establish additional affiliates and subsidiaries in other countries.

   To facilitate our operations and to help deliver our Services globally,
   we may transfer personal information to the U.S. and any other country
   where our affiliates, subsidiaries, vendors, consultants and service
   providers operate. For example, we may transfer your personal
   information to Samba’s servers in the U.S. to provide you with relevant
   recommendations on Samba TV Mobile.

   The countries where we may transfer your personal information might
   have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as
   the laws of your country of residence. When we transfer your personal
   information abroad, we will take appropriate safeguards to protect the
   information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and seek to ensure
   that overseas recipients comply with applicable privacy laws.

   When we transfer personal data outside of the EEA or Switzerland, we
   ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights of data subjects
   based on: the adequacy of the receiving country’s data protection laws,
   contracts that place obligations on the recipient of the data pursuant
   to model clauses approved by the European Commissions, or EU-US and
   Swiss-US Privacy Shield principles (the “Principles”). Samba TV is a
   participant in the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
   programs (https://www.privacyshield.gov/list).

   Regarding data transfers from the EEA or Switzerland, Samba TV is
   committed to the Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for
   Onward Transfer to Third Parties, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose
   Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability, as
   indicated by our EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
   certifications. Please note that notwithstanding any language to the
   contrary in this Privacy Policy, in cases of onward transfer of
   personal information to third parties pursuant to the EU-US and
   Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Samba TV is potentially liable.

   If you have a Privacy Shield-related complaint, please contact us at
   privacy@samba.tv. As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, if
   you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the Principles, you
   may address it through our internal complaint resolution process, or
   through the independent dispute resolution body JAMS at no cost to you.

   Privacy Shield participants are subject to the investigatory and
   enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other
   authorized statutory bodies. Under certain conditions you may invoke
   binding arbitration before the Privacy Shield Panel. Learn more about
   the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield here.

   Please note that for data transfers involving personal data from
   Argentine data subjects, we will rely on the principles and standards
   of the model contract clauses approved by the Argentine Data Protection
   Agency in Disposition 60/E/2016, for the transfer of personal data to
   countries that, according to the Agency, do not provide an adequate
   level of data protection.

   If you would like more information, please feel free to contact us
   through the email or at the address provided in the Contact Us section.

Your Rights and Choices

   Below are the rights and choices we provide in connection with the
   practices described in this Policy.

Smart TV Services

   We require TV manufacturers to provide you with an opt-in to enable our
   Smart TV Services that collect Content Viewership Information. This
   opt-in will usually be presented when you first set up your Smart TV,
   or after your Smart TV gets a software update that includes our Smart
   TV Services.

   You should be able to opt out of, or in to, our Smart TV Services at
   any time your TV is connected to the Internet. You typically can find
   our opt-out and opt-in feature in the “settings” menu of your TV or
   within the Smart TV Services user interface.  If you have trouble
   finding this feature, you should contact the TV manufacturer to
   determine the exact location.  If you opt out of our Smart TV Services,
   we will no longer collect TV viewing information through this service.
    However, we still may receive Content Viewership Information, as
   described above in the “Collection of Information” section, when you
   watch content through certain Smart TV Apps.

   Also, if you opt out of our Smart TV Services, you will not be able to
   take advantage of our interactive features on your Smart TV; or,
   features of other applications that rely on Smart TV Services to
   operate (after you authorized their use), such as receiving content
   recommendations based on the shows you love, interacting or playing
   along with your favorite shows using your TV remote or mobile device,
   accessing exclusive content and offers, resuming a show from where you
   left off and receiving notifications when the show you were watching
   returns from commercial.

   You may also choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking from the Privacy menu
   within Smart TV Settings on your Smart TV. If you do so, our
   advertising platform will opt your Samba TV Advertising ID out of
   receiving targeted advertising based on Content Viewing Information
   from Smart TV Services, regardless of what device you are using. Note
   that whenever you want to unlink the data associated with your Samba TV
   Advertising ID, you can simply reset it. Please check with the TV
   manufacturer for the exact location of these features. If you cannot
   find them or your TV manufacturer has not enabled them, please contact
   us at privacy-support@samba.tv.

   If you intend to sell or otherwise give away your Smart TV, you should
   perform a “factory reset.” This will 1) reset the Samba TV advertising
   ID, and 2) allow the new owner of the TV to choose whether they want to
   opt-in or opt-out. If you sell or give away your Smart TV without
   performing a “factory reset,” information about the new owner may be
   incorrectly attributed to you.

Web and Mobile Apps

   Samba TV is an active member of the Network Advertising Initiative
   (“NAI”), an industry association that develops the policies around
   online consumer privacy in the context of interest-based advertising.
   Samba TV complies with the NAI Code of Conduct. Consistent with our
   commitment to the NAI principles, we provide means for you to opt out
   of interest-based advertising based on your web browsing and mobile app
   usage:
     * Web Browsers:
       You can opt out of having Samba use your web browsing information
       for interest-based advertisements by visiting
       http://optout.networkadvertising.org or accessing “Opt out of Samba
       TV Ads” using the opt-out link available below.
     * Mobile Devices:
       For the most effective and up-to-date methods to limit ad tracking
       on your mobile device, please refer to your mobile operating system
       settings to see how you can opt out of interest-based
       advertisements, or reset your mobile device advertiser ID to unlink
       information previously associated with your advertiser ID.

   You may learn more about interest-based advertising, as well as
   pertinent self-regulatory frameworks — and companies like Samba TV that
   strive to embrace such regimes — by visiting the NAI
   (https://www.networkadvertising.org) or the Digital Advertising
   Alliance (http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org).

   Opt out of Samba TV ads.

Cookies and Local Storage

   If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or
   reject browser cookies or to clear local storage. Please note that if
   you choose to remove or reject cookies or clear local storage, this
   could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.

Location Information

   You can turn location-based services on and off by adjusting the
   settings of your mobile device.

Account Information and Requests

   In accordance with applicable law you may have the right to access,
   update or delete personal information we hold about you, including
   deleting Content Viewing Information. This means you may have the right
   to 1) be informed of the personal information we collect, how we use
   it, what personal information we have shared with third parties, and to
   be provided with a copy of that information; and 2) have corrections
   made, or have the information deleted if it is not accurate or
   processed in violation of applicable laws.  You may be able to exercise
   these rights by logging into your online account within the Samba TV
   products and services that you use.  Otherwise please submit a written
   request using the details provided in the Contact Us section below.

   Further, if you are from certain territories, you may have the right to
   exercise additional rights available to you under applicable laws,
   including broader rights to access and erasure of your personal
   information, the right to object to or restrict processing of your
   personal information, or the right to data portability in certain
   circumstances. If you would like to make such a request, please contact
   us at privacy@samba.tv or at the address provided below in the Contact
   Us section.

   We will consider all requests in accordance with applicable laws. To
   obtain access to your personal information, we may require that you
   provide additional information to confirm your identity. This
   confirming information will only be used to process your request. To
   correct any information we have about you, please send a correction
   request following the same instructions as above.

   Remember that in certain jurisdictions you also have the right to
   complain to a dataprotection authority (“DPA”) about our collection and
   use of your personal information. For moreinformation, please contact
   your local DPA in the EU or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and
   InformationCommissioner. In addition, as discussed above, if you are
   from the EEA or Switzerland and you have a dispute withus about our
   adherence to the Principles, you may address it through our internal
   complaint resolution process,or through the independent dispute
   resolution body JAMS at no cost to you.

Retention of Information

   We will generally retain your personal information for as long as is
   needed to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. However,
   we may retain certain information as required by the applicable law
   (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements), or for
   legitimate business purposes. When we have no basis to continue
   processing your personal information, we will either delete or
   anonymize it in accordance with applicable laws (though we may need to
   retain cached or archived copies for a certain period until deletion is
   possible).

   We may store Content Viewership Information so long as you continue to
   have a relationship with our Smart TV Services. Content Viewing
   Information may be stored up to ten (10) years from the last time our
   Services encounter a particular device unless you ask us to delete that
   information by following the instructions above.

Promotional Communications

   From time to time, we may send you marketing communications about our
   products and services, in accordance with your preferences. You may opt
   out of receiving promotional messages from us at any time by following
   the instructions in those messages (often it will be a notice or link
   at the bottom of the message). If you opt out, we may still send you
   non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our
   ongoing business relations.

Mobile Push Notifications

   With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push
   notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these
   messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your
   mobile device.

Withdrawal of Consent

   Where we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you
   have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

Legal Basis for Processing (EEA and Switzerland)

   If you are an individual from the EEA or Switzerland, our legal basis
   for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the
   personal information concerned and the specific context in which we
   collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from
   you only where: 1) we have your consent to do so, 2) where we need the
   personal information to perform a contract with you (such as delivering
   the Services to you), or 3) where the processing is in our or a third
   party’s legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection
   interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may
   also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you,
   or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital
   interests or those of another person.

   Where we rely on your consent to process personal information, you have
   the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time. Please note
   that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on
   consent prior to its withdrawal.

   If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
   requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear
   at the relevant time and let you know whether the provision of your
   personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible
   consequences if you do not provide it). Similarly, if we collect and
   use your personal information in reliance on our (or a third party’s)
   legitimate interests which are not already described in this policy, we
   will make it clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate
   interests are.

   If you have any questions about or need further information concerning
   the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information,
   please contact us at privacy@samba.tv or at the address provided below
   in the Contact Us section.

Rights of Argentine Data Subjects and Legal Basis for Processing Their Data

   Please be aware that if you are an Argentine data subject, you have the
   right to access, delete, update or amend your personal data under
   Argentina’s Data Protection Act.

   If you are an individual from Argentina, the legal basis for processing
   your personal data, as well as collecting and using your personal
   information will depend on the personal information concerned and the
   specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally
   collect personal information from you only where: 1) we have your
   consent to do so, and 2) the existence of a contractual relationship
   between you and Samba TV by the virtue of the use of our products and
   services.

   The owner of the personal data has the right to exercise and the right
   of access his or her data free of charge at intervals of not less than
   six months, unless a legitimate interest is accredited for the purpose
   as established in article 14, subsection 3 of the Law No. 25,326. In
   addition, the owner of personal data also has the right to update or
   request the deletion of his or her personal data pursuant to article 16
   of Law 25,326.

   The NATIONAL DIRECTORATE OF PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA, Body of
   Control of Law No. 25,326, has the power to address complaints and
   claims that are filed in relation to the breach of the rules on
   protection of personal data.

   Argentine data subjects who wish to file a formal complaint regarding
   the collection and use of their personal information by Samba TV must
   contact the Agency for Access to Public Information at:

Changes

   We may change this policy from time to time. If we make changes, we
   will revise the date at the top of the policy and provide notice.  Such
   notice may take various forms, such as updating the date on the top of
   the policy, adding a statement to our website, sending you an email, or
   providing an on-screen notification on your Smart TV.

Polityka prywatności firmy Samba TV

   Ostatnia aktualizacja: 28 lutego 2018 r.

   W firmie Free Stream Media Corp. (“Samba TV”, “Samba”, “Firma”, “my”,
   “nasze” lub ich odmiany) wiemy, że użytkownicy zwracają uwagę na
   sposoby wykorzystywania oraz udostępniania swoich danych. Niniejsza
   Polityka prywatności (lub “Polityka”) opisuje praktyki Firmy, w tym
   wybory użytkownika, dotyczące gromadzonych informacji.

   Niniejsza Polityka dotyczy wszystkich produktów i usług Firmy (“Usługi
   Samba” lub “Usługi”). Usługi Firmy obejmują usługi i aplikacje Smart TV
   (na przykład Hotlist oraz Interaktywne usługi telewizyjne Samba),
   witryny internetowe (w tym www.samba.tv) oraz nasze aplikacje mobilne.
   Usługi Firmy obejmują również nasze produkty i usługi, które można
   zintegrować z witrynami, aplikacjami mobilnymi i aplikacjami Smart TV
   innych dostawców usług (“Usługi zintegrowane”).

   Firma Samba TV dba o prywatność swoich użytkowników. Wszelkie
   ewentualne pytania prosimy kierować pod adres privacy@samba.tva lub
   przekazać je w sposób opisany poniżej w sekcji “Kontakt z nami”.

Gromadzenie informacji

Informacje podane Firmie przez użytkownika

   Firma gromadzi informacje podane jej bezpośrednio przez użytkownika.
   Gromadzone informacje obejmują na przykład informacje podawane podczas
   tworzenia konta, aktualizacji profilu, korzystania z funkcji
   interaktywnych w ramach Usług, wypełniania formularzy, składania próśb
   o pomoc techniczną lub komunikacji z Firmą. Do gromadzonych informacji
   mogą zaliczać się: imię i nazwisko, adres e-mail, numer telefonu,
   zainteresowania i preferencje, lokalizacja oraz inne informacje, jakie
   użytkownik zdecyduje się podać.

   Podawanie Firmie danych osobowych dotyczących osoby trzeciej wymaga od
   użytkownika upewnienia się co do prawomocności ujawniania tych
   informacji, włącznie z uzyskaniem wymaganej zgody danej osoby odnośnie
   takiego działania oraz przyzwolenia Firmie na gromadzenie,
   wykorzystywanie oraz ujawnianie tychże danych dla celów określonych w
   niniejszej Polityce prywatności. Wszelkie działania w zakresie
   gromadzenia i przetwarzania informacji podanych przez użytkownika
   odnośnie osoby trzeciej będą zgodne z postanowieniami niniejszej
   Polityki.

Informacje gromadzone podczas korzystania z Usług Firmy

   Firma gromadzi informacje na temat rodzaju Usług wykorzystywanych przez
   użytkownika oraz sposobów ich użytkowania w gospodarstwie domowym,
   takich jak oglądanie filmów w serwisie Hotlist, odwiedzanie witryn
   internetowych czy używanie aplikacji innych dostawców usług, które
   korzystają z naszych Usług zintegrowanych lub współpracują z reklamami
   i treściami Firmy. Informacje te obejmują:
     * Informacje z rejestrów:Podczas korzystania przez użytkownika z
       naszych Usług Firma automatycznie gromadzi standardowe pliki
       rejestrów, obejmujące dane odnośnie daty i godziny dostępu,
       wyświetlanych stron lub funkcji, adresu IP, rodzaju używanej
       przeglądarki oraz stosownego adresu URL.
     * Informacje o urządzeniu:Firma gromadzi informacje odnośnie
       specyfikacji urządzeń używanych do interakcji z naszymi Usługami.
       Mogą one obejmować model i markę sprzętu, system operacyjny,
       identyfikatory urządzenia, dane użycia zasobów oraz dzienniki
       błędów. Firma może również rejestrować dostępność urządzeń do
       nawiązania połączenia z telewizorem Smart TV, na przykład poprzez
       wysłanie sygnału z urządzenia użytkownika do pobliskiego telewizora
       Smart TV lub wykorzystanie Interaktywnych usług telewizyjnych Firmy
       do sprawdzenia, jakie urządzenia są podłączone do tej samej sieci,
       co telewizor Smart TV. Informacje te mogą następnie służyć do
       ułatwienia procedury podłączania urządzenia użytkownika do
       telewizora Smart TV.
     * Informacje o wyświetlanych treściach:Firma otrzymuje informacje o
       treściach wyświetlanych przez użytkownika oraz jego interakcjach z
       treściami za pośrednictwem telewizora Smart TV, który obsługuje
       Interaktywne usługi telewizyjne Firmy lub za pośrednictwem
       aplikacji Smart TV (“Informacje o wyświetlanych treściach”).
       Informacje o wyświetlanych treściach mogą obejmować m.in. tytuł
       materiału, działania podejmowane podczas oglądania oraz czas
       wyświetlania treści przez użytkownika.
       Firma otrzymuje te informacje na dwa różne sposoby:
          + Poprzez aplikacje Smart TV: Firma może otrzymywać takie
            informacje o wyświetlanych treściach, gdy użytkownik korzysta
            z naszych aplikacji Smart TV lub z aplikacji Smart TV innych
            dostawców wykorzystujących Usługi zintegrowane Firmy.
          + Poprzez Interaktywne usługi telewizyjne: Gdy użytkownik
            rozpoczyna korzystanie z naszych Interaktywnych usług
            telewizyjnych, Firma może rozpoznawać treści odtwarzane na
            telewizorze użytkownika. Należy zaznaczyć, że Firma jest w
            stanie rozpoznawać wyłącznie treści publiczne, takie jak pewne
            programy i filmy. Rozpoznanie przez Firmę, że użytkownik
            ogląda, na przykład, domowe filmy wideo nie jest możliwe.
     * Dokładne informacje o lokalizacji:Za zgodą użytkownika Firma może
       gromadzić informacje na temat szczegółowej lokalizacji jego
       urządzenia, włącznie z danymi czasowymi odnośnie uzyskiwania
       dostępu lub używania naszych aplikacji mobilnych lub aplikacji
       wykorzystującej Usługi zintegrowane Firmy.
     * Informacje gromadzone za pomocą plików cookie oraz innych
       technologii:Firma wykorzystuje różne technologie do gromadzenia
       danych podczas interakcji użytkownika z naszymi Usługami. Należą do
       nich pliki cookie, pamięć lokalna i sygnały nawigacyjne. Pliki
       cookie i pamięć lokalna to niewielkie pliki danych zapisywane w
       urządzeniu użytkownika w momencie odwiedzania strony lub witryny
       internetowej. Umożliwiają one Firmie oraz jej klientom zapewnianie
       użytkownikowi określonych funkcji (takich, jak utrzymywanie sesji
       zalogowania do witryny), pomiary popularności naszych Usług oraz
       monitorowanie ich działania.
       Sygnały nawigacyjne (lub znaczniki pikselowe) to obrazy
       elektroniczne, które mogą być używane w Usługach lub wiadomościach
       e-mail Firmy w celu ułatwienia dostarczania plików cookie,
       zliczania liczby odwiedzin w danej witrynie oraz określania
       skuteczności kampanii marketingowych prowadzonych za pośrednictwem
       poczty elektronicznej. Nasze pliki cookie są skonfigurowane tak,
       aby przestać działać po upływie dwudziestu czterech (24) miesięcy
       od czasu ostatniego kontaktu systemów Firmy z danym komputerem lub
       urządzeniem.
     * Informacje pochodzące z Usług zintegrowanych:Firma gromadzi
       informacje, gdy użytkownik odwiedza lub korzysta z witryn i
       aplikacji innych dostawców usług wykorzystujących nasze Usługi
       zintegrowane, a dane zbierane są między innymi za pośrednictwem
       plików cookie oraz innych technologii opisanych powyżej. Jeśli, na
       przykład, użytkownik sparuje aplikację platformy telewizyjnej ze
       swoim telewizorem, taka platforma może skorzystać z technologii
       Firmy do zsynchronizowania środowiska użytkownika w swoich
       aplikacjach mobilnych, gdy ogląda on program na swoim telewizorze.
       Ponadto aplikacje i witryny internetowe innych dostawców mogą
       wykorzystywać pomiary i usługi reklamowe Firmy w celu lepszego
       poznania profilu użytkowania swoich usług i wyświetlania reklam
       zgodnych z zainteresowaniami użytkownika. Gromadzone przez nas dane
       obejmują informacje na temat korzystania przez użytkownika z takich
       witryn i aplikacji, a także informacje, które Firma może zgromadzić
       za pośrednictwem usług oferowanych przez takie aplikacje lub
       witryny. Przykładowo, dostawca usług strumieniowego przesyłania
       materiałów wideo może udostępniać Firmie informacje o treściach
       oglądanych przez użytkownika, co pozwoli nam sugerować
       użytkownikowi dodatkowe materiały mogące wzbudzić jego
       zainteresowanie.
       Użytkownik może zrezygnować z udostępniania informacji za
       pośrednictwem naszych Usług zintegrowanych, postępując zgodnie z
       instrukcjami wskazanymi w części “Aplikacje internetowe i mobilne”
       Sekcji “Prawa i wybory użytkownika” poniżej.
     * Informacje gromadzone z innych źródeł:W okolicznościach
       dopuszczalnych prawem Firma może także pozyskiwać informacje z
       innych źródeł i łączyć je z informacjami gromadzonymi za
       pośrednictwem naszych Usług. Firma może, na przykład, uzyskiwać
       informacje od dostawców danych oraz serwisów wymiany reklam, takie
       jak zakładane dane demograficzne i obszary zainteresowań oraz dane
       dotyczące interakcji użytkownika z reklamami Firmy.
       Ponadto, jeśli użytkownik utworzy konto lub zaloguje się do swojego
       konta Samba TV za pośrednictwem serwisu mediów społecznościowych,
       Firma zyska dostęp do pewnych informacji pochodzących z takiego
       serwisu w zakresie zgodnym z ustawieniami użytkownika i
       upoważnieniami przyznanymi przez niego Firmie za pośrednictwem w/w
       usługi.

Wykorzystywanie informacji

   Firma może wykorzystywać zgromadzone przez siebie informacje w
   następujących celach:
     * Świadczenie, utrzymywanie i ulepszanie naszych Usług (na przykład w
       celu poprawy jakości interakcji z użytkownikiem, naprawy usterek
       obsługi, testowania systemów bezpieczeństwa Firmy, zwiększenia
       wydajności technicznej itp.);
     * Monitorowanie i analizy korzystania z Usług Firmy;
     * Personalizowanie Usług Firmy i dostarczanie sugestii, reklam,
       treści i funkcji zgodnych z zainteresowaniami użytkownika;
     * Poprawa działania systemów reklamowych i pomiarowych, tak aby
       dostarczać użytkownikowi odpowiednie dla niego reklamy zarówno w
       trakcie, jak i poza zakresem korzystania z naszych Usług
       (przykładowo, zainteresowanie użytkownika programami kulinarnymi
       może sprawić, że Firma będzie wyświetlać mu reklamy związane z nową
       telewizyjną ofertą takich materiałów);
     * Komunikacja z użytkownikiem dotycząca produktów, usług, ofert i
       wydarzeń oferowanych przez firmę Samba TV lub inne podmioty oraz
       dostarczanie treści, które zdaniem Firmy mogą zainteresować
       użytkownika;
     * Odpowiadanie na uwagi i pytania użytkownika oraz obsługa klienta;
       oraz
     * Wykrywanie i badanie nieuczciwych transakcji oraz innych
       nielegalnych działań, zapobieganie im oraz ochrona praw,
       bezpieczeństwa i własności firmy Samba TV oraz innych podmiotów.

   Celem wyjaśnienia, informacje o użytkowniku lub jego gospodarstwie
   domowym otrzymywane przez Firmę w trakcie korzystania przez użytkownika
   z jednego urządzenia lub telewizora Smart TV mogą zostać powiązane z
   informacjami gromadzonymi podczas użytkowania przez daną osobę innych
   urządzeń lub telewizorów Smart TV. Jeśli, na przykład, Firma wie, że
   użytkownik lubi oglądać piłkę nożną na swoim telewizorze Smart TV, może
   ona w czasie rzeczywistym wyświetlać takiej osobie na urządzeniu
   mobilnym statystyki bieżących meczów. Użytkownik może w każdej chwili
   zrezygnować z otrzymywania dostosowanych treści na swoich urządzeniach
   domowych, postępując zgodnie z instrukcjami wskazanymi w sekcji “Prawa
   i wybory użytkownika” poniżej.

Udostępnianie informacji

Informacje udostępniane przez użytkownika

   Gdy użytkownik zamieszcza post w obszarach interaktywnych witryn
   internetowych lub aplikacji Firmy, inni użytkownicy tychże usług będą
   widzieć posty wraz z nazwą użytkownika, który je zamieścił oraz czasem
   ich opublikowania.

   Usługi mogą oferować funkcje udostępniania treści w serwisach
   społecznościowych oraz inne narzędzia zintegrowane — takie, jak
   przycisk “Lubię to” platformy Facebook — które umożliwiają
   użytkownikowi dzielenie się aktywnością dokonywaną w naszych Usługach w
   innych mediach i odwrotnie. Korzystanie przez użytkownika z takich
   funkcji umożliwia udostępnianie informacji znajomym lub przestrzeni
   publicznej, w zależności od ustawień skonfigurowanych w danej firmie i
   odnośnych warunków korzystania z usług oraz polityki prywatności tychże
   firm.

Informacje udostępniane przez Firmę

   Firma może udostępniać informacje gromadzone o użytkowniku stronom
   trzecim w następujących okolicznościach:
     * Za zgodą lub z polecenia użytkownika:Na mocy polecenia lub
       wyrażenia przez użytkownika zgody Firma udostępni informacje
       firmom, organizacjom lub indywidualnym osobom spoza domeny Samba
       TV. Gdy użytkownik upoważnia Firmę do udostępnienia informacji o
       sobie innym firmom, należy zapoznać się z ich polityką prywatności,
       aby wiedzieć, w jaki sposób dane informacje mogą być używane oraz
       traktowane.
     * W relacjach z dostawcami, konsultantami i operatorami
       przetwarzającymi dane:Firma może udostępniać informacje
       sprzedawcom, konsultantom i operatorom przetwarzania danych,
       dostawcom usług oraz innym zaufanym firmom działającym w naszym
       imieniu.
     * Z powodów prawnych:Firma może udostępniać informacje firmom,
       organizacjom lub indywidualnym osobom spoza domeny Samba TV: w
       odpowiedzi na żądanie udzielenia informacji, jeśli Firma uważa, że
       takie ujawnienie jest zgodne lub wymagane przez obowiązujące prawo
       lub proces prawny; jeśli Firma uważa, że działania użytkownika są
       niezgodne z naszymi umowami użytkownika; lub w celu ochrony praw,
       własności lub bezpieczeństwa firmy Samba lub innych podmiotów.
     * W relacjach z naszą korporacyjną rodziną:Firma może udostępniać
       informacje pomiędzy i w środowisku bieżących i przyszłych organów
       nadrzędnych, podmiotów zależnych, spółek podległych oraz innych
       firm działających pod wspólną własnością i kontrolą Samba TV. Firma
       opiera takie działania na swoich uzasadnionych interesach
       zmierzających do zarządzania i zapewniania Usług zgodnie z opisem w
       niniejszej Polityce.
       Firma może również udostępniać informacje w związku z jakąkolwiek
       fuzją, sprzedażą dóbr, finansowaniem lub nabyciem całości lub
       części Firmy przez inną firmę.
     * Kiedy użytkownik nie jest bezpośrednio identyfikowany:Firma może
       udostępniać pewne informacje, takie jak informacje o wyświetlanych
       treściach, które same w sobie bezpośrednio nie identyfikują
       użytkownika jako osoby fizycznej. Takie informacje mogą być
       udostępniane partnerom Firmy oraz klientom (włącznie z ich
       podawaniem do celów reklamowych lub analitycznych) oraz do
       informacji publicznej. Firma może, na przykład, publikować zbiorcze
       raporty dotyczące liczby osób, które obejrzały określony program
       telewizyjny. Firma może też udostępniać dane o urządzeniu
       użytkownika platformom usług reklamowych w celu wyświetlania treści
       reklamowych bardziej dostosowanych do zainteresowań danej osoby.
       Dla wyjaśnienia, dane osobowe udostępniane przez Firmę nie będą
       bezpośrednio identyfikować użytkownika, ale mogą określać daną
       osobę pośrednio, na przykład za pośrednictwem używanego urządzenia
       lub innych środków. Rodzaje informacji osobistych, które Firma może
       udostępniać, obejmują: identyfikatory urządzeń, identyfikatory
       reklamowe, adresy IP, zaszyfrowane/zakodowane wersje adresu e-mail
       użytkownika lub innego identyfikatora osoby lub identyfikatory
       pseudonimowe.

Usługi analityczne i reklamowe świadczone przez inne podmioty

   Firma angażuje inne firmy do obsługi w jej imieniu reklam w Internecie
   oraz do świadczenia usług analitycznych.

   Takie podmioty mogą używać plików cookie, sygnałów nawigacyjnych,
   identyfikatorów urządzeń oraz innych technologii do gromadzenia
   informacji na temat sposobów, w jakie użytkownik korzysta z Usług,
   innych witryn internetowych i aplikacji, a w szczególności adresu IP,
   rodzaju przeglądarki internetowej, wyświetlanych stron, czasu
   spędzanego na określonych stronach i w aplikacjach, klikanych
   odnośników oraz informacji na temat konwersji. Firma Samba TV oraz inne
   podmioty mogą wykorzystywać te informacje do różnorakich celów, m.in.
   do analizowania i śledzenia danych, oceny popularności określonych
   funkcji, wyświetlania reklam zgodnych z preferencjami użytkownika oraz
   innych treści dostosowanych do zainteresowań danej osoby w Usługach
   firmy oraz w innych witrynach internetowych, a także do lepszego
   poznawania profilu aktywności użytkownika w sieci.

Bezpieczeństwo

   Firma Samba TV podejmuje uzasadnione i właściwe środki w celu
   zabezpieczenia informacji o użytkowniku przed utratą, kradzieżą,
   nieuprawnionym użyciem i nieautoryzowanym dostępem, ujawnieniem,
   modyfikacją oraz zniszczeniem.

Transfery międzynarodowe

   Firma Samba TV ma swoją siedzibę w Stanach Zjednoczonych oraz posiada
   obecnie filie w Wielkiej Brytanii, Polsce i na Tajwanie. W przyszłości
   Firma może również ustanawiać dodatkowe spółki stowarzyszone i zależne
   w innych krajach.

   W celu ułatwienia prowadzenia działalności oraz w ramach pomocy w
   świadczeniu naszych Usług, Firma może przekazywać dane osobowe do USA
   oraz wszelkich innych krajów, w których działają nasze spółki
   stowarzyszone lub zależne, sprzedawcy, konsultanci i dostawcy usług.
   Firma może, na przykład, przenieść dane osobowe użytkownika na serwery
   firmy Samba w USA w celu zapewnienia odpowiednich rekomendacji w
   usłudze Hotlist.

   Kraje docelowe przekazywanych informacji osobowych mogą posiadać prawa
   inne i potencjalnie mniej skuteczne w ochronie danych niż prawa kraju
   zamieszkania użytkownika.

   Podczas przekazywania danych osobowych użytkownika za granicę Firma
   podejmie odpowiednie środki bezpieczeństwa zmierzające do ochrony
   informacji w zgodności z niniejszą Polityką prywatności oraz postara
   się zapewnić przestrzeganie przez zagranicznych odbiorców informacji
   obowiązujących przepisów w zakresie prywatności danych.

   W przypadku przekazywania danych z obszaru EOG Firma opiera się na
   zatwierdzonych standardowych klauzulach umownych Komisji Europejskiej w
   celu umożliwienia przekazywania danych osobowych do terytoriów spoza
   EOG. Użytkownik może poprosić i otrzymać egzemplarz w/w standardowych
   klauzul zatwierdzonych przez Komisję, kontaktując się z Firmą w sposób
   podany w sekcji “Kontakt z nami” poniżej.

   Należy zaznaczyć, że w przypadku przekazywania danych obejmujących
   informacje osobowe od podmiotów danych z Argentyny Firma będzie polegać
   na zasadach i standardach wzorcowych klauzul kontraktowych
   zatwierdzonych przez Argentyńską Agencję Ochrony Danych (Argentine Data
   Protection Agency) w Rozporządzeniu nr 60/E/2016 odnośnie przekazywania
   danych osobowych do krajów, które zdaniem agencji nie zapewniają
   odpowiedniego poziomu ochrony danych.

   Więcej informacji na te tematy można uzyskać, kontaktując się z Firmą
   pocztą elektroniczną lub pisząc na adres podany w sekcji “Kontakt z
   nami”.

Prawa i wybory użytkownika

   Poniżej przedstawiono prawa i wybory zapewniane przez Firmę
   użytkownikowi w związku z praktykami opisanymi w niniejszej Polityce.

Interaktywne i inteligentne usługi telewizyjne

   Firma wymaga od producentów odbiorników telewizyjnych zapewnienia
   użytkownikowi możliwości aktywowania naszych Interaktywnych usług
   telewizyjnych, które gromadzą informacje o odbiorcach treści. Opcja
   taka będzie zazwyczaj zaprezentowana podczas pierwszej konfiguracji
   telewizora Smart TV lub po pobraniu przez telewizor Smart TV
   aktualizacji oprogramowania zawierającej Interaktywne usługi
   telewizyjne Firmy.

   Użytkownik powinien mieć możliwość włączenia lub rezygnacji z
   Interaktywnych usług telewizyjnych Firmy w dowolnej chwili, gdy
   telewizor jest połączony z Internetem. Opcję aktywowania lub
   dezaktywacji tej funkcji można zwykle znaleźć w obszarze “Ustawienia”
   telewizora Smart TV lub w interfejsie użytkownika Interaktywnych usług
   telewizyjnych. W razie problemów ze zlokalizowaniem tej funkcji należy
   skontaktować się z producentem telewizora, który wskaże dokładną
   lokalizację. Jeśli użytkownik zrezygnuje z Interaktywnych usług
   telewizyjnych, Firma zaprzestanie gromadzenia informacji o
   wyświetlanych treściach za pośrednictwem tej usługi. Jeśli jednak
   użytkownik będzie oglądać treści za pośrednictwem pewnych aplikacji
   Smart TV, Firma nadal będzie mogła otrzymywać informacje o odbiorcach
   treści, zgodnie z opisem zawartym powyżej w sekcji “Gromadzenie
   informacji”.

   Ponadto, w przypadku rezygnacji z Interaktywnych usług telewizyjnych
   Firmy użytkownik straci możliwość korzystania na swoim telewizorze
   Smart TV z naszych funkcji interaktywnych lub funkcji innych aplikacji,
   które opierają swoje działanie na Usługach Smart TV (po autoryzacji ich
   wykorzystania), takich jak wyświetlanie sugerowanych treści w oparciu o
   programy preferowane przez użytkownika, interakcja lub zabawa z
   ulubionymi programami za pomocą pilota lub urządzenia mobilnego, dostęp
   do treści wyłącznych i ofert, powrót do miejsca programu, w którym
   użytkownik zakończył oglądanie, oraz otrzymywanie powiadomień o
   zakończeniu reklam w trakcie oglądanego programu.

   Użytkownik może też zdecydować o włączeniu opcji ograniczenia śledzenia
   reklam z menu Prywatność znajdującego się w sekcji Ustawienia
   interaktywnej telewizji na telewizorze Smart TV. Decyzja taka
   spowoduje, że platforma reklamowa wykluczy identyfikator reklamowy
   użytkownika Samba TV z puli odbiorców otrzymujących reklamy kierowane
   na podstawie informacji o wyświetlanych treściach z usług Smart TV,
   niezależnie od używanego urządzenia. Należy pamiętać, że zawsze możliwe
   jest odłączenie danych powiązanych z identyfikatorem reklamowym
   użytkownika Samba TV poprzez zresetowanie go. Dokładną lokalizację tych
   funkcji można sprawdzić u producenta telewizora. W przypadku
   niemożności znalezienia funkcji lub jeśli producent telewizora nie
   aktywował ich, prosimy o kontakt z nami pod adresem
   privacy-support@samba.tv.

   Jeśli Użytkownik zamierza sprzedać lub w inny sposób przekazać innej
   osobie swój odbiornik Smart TV, należy wykonać procedurę “przywrócenie
   ustawień fabrycznych”. Spowoduje to 1) zresetowanie identyfikatora
   reklamowego Samba TV oraz 2) umożliwienie nowemu właścicielowi
   telewizora wyboru włączenia lub nie danych funkcji. Sprzedaż lub
   przekazanie innej osobie odbiornika Smart TV bez “przywrócenia ustawień
   fabrycznych”, może skutkować niepoprawnym przypisaniem użytkownikowi
   informacji o nowym właścicielu.

Aplikacje internetowe i mobilne

   Firma Samba TV jest aktywnym członkiem Network Advertising Initiative
   (“NAI”), stowarzyszenia branżowego, które opracowuje zasady dotyczące
   prywatności konsumentów w Internecie w kontekście reklam opartych na
   zainteresowaniach użytkowników. Firma Samba TV przestrzega Kodeksu
   postępowania NAI. Zgodnie ze zobowiązaniem Firmy do postępowania
   zgodnie z zasadami NAI użytkownikowi zapewniona zostaje możliwość
   rezygnacji z reklam opartych na zainteresowaniach w oparciu o
   przeglądanie stron internetowych i korzystanie z aplikacji mobilnych:
     * Przeglądarki internetowe:Użytkownik może zrezygnować z
       wykorzystywania przez firmę Samba informacji o historii
       przeglądanych treści do personalizacji reklam opartych na
       zainteresowaniach, odwiedzając stronę
       http://optout.networkadvertising.org lub używając opcji “Rezygnacja
       z reklam Samba TV” dostępnej pod adresem
       https://samba.tv/legal/privacy-policy/.
     * Urządzenia mobilne:Najskuteczniejsze i najbardziej aktualne sposoby
       ograniczania śledzenia reklam na urządzeniu mobilnym można znaleźć
       w ustawieniach systemu operacyjnego urządzenia mobilnego. Obejmują
       one informacje o tym, w jaki sposób zrezygnować z wyświetlania
       reklam opartych na preferencjach lub zresetować identyfikator
       reklamowy urządzenia mobilnego w celu usunięcia powiązania
       uprzednio wyświetlanych treści z identyfikatorem reklamowym
       użytkownika.

   Więcej informacji odnośnie reklam opartych na zainteresowaniach, a
   także odpowiednich ram samoregulacji — oraz firm, które tak, jak Samba
   TV starają się przestrzegać w/w wytycznych — można znaleźć w witrynie
   NAI (http://optout.networkadvertising.org) lub Digital Advertising
   Alliance (http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org).

   lub odrzucanie plików cookie przeglądarki lub kasowanie pamięci
   lokalnej. Należy pamiętać, że w przypadku wybrania usuwania lub

   Użytkownik może włączać i wyłączać usługi oparte na lokalizacji za

Informacje i wnioski odnośnie konta

   Zgodnie z obowiązującą legislacją użytkownik może mieć prawo do
   uzyskiwania dostępu, aktualizowania lub usuwania danych osobowych
   utrzymywanych przez Firmę odnośnie swojej osoby, włącznie z usuwaniem
   informacji o wyświetlanych treściach. Oznacza to, że użytkownik może
   mieć prawo do: 1) otrzymywania informacji o gromadzonych przez Firmę
   danych osobowych, sposobach ich wykorzystywania, zakresie informacji
   osobowych udostępnianych przez Firmę stronom trzecim, oraz do uzyskania
   kopii tychże informacji; oraz 2) możliwości wprowadzania poprawek lub
   usuwania informacji w przypadku ich niedokładności lub przetwarzania z
   naruszeniem obowiązujących przepisów. Aby skorzystać z tych praw,
   należy zalogować się do internetowego konta użytkownika w obrębie
   używanych produktów i usług Samba TV. W innych przypadkach prosimy o
   przesłanie pisemnego wniosku na adres podany poniżej w sekcji “Kontakt
   z nami”.

   Ponadto, jeśli użytkownik pochodzi z pewnych określonych terytoriów,
   może mieć prawo do skorzystania z dodatkowych praw przysługujących na
   mocy obowiązujących przepisów, w tym szerszych praw dostępu do danych
   osobowych i ich usuwania, prawa do zgłaszania sprzeciwu lub
   ograniczania przetwarzania swoich danych osobowych, lub prawa do
   przenoszenia danych w pewnych okolicznościach. Ewentualne wnioski w tym
   zakresie prosimy kierować na adres privacy@samba.tva lub przekazać je w
   sposób opisany poniżej w sekcji “Kontakt z nami”.

   Wszystkie wnioski będą rozpatrywane przez Firmę zgodnie z
   obowiązującymi przepisami. Uzyskanie dostępu do danych osobowych
   użytkownika może wymagać podania dodatkowych informacji w celu
   potwierdzenia swojej tożsamości. Informacje wymagane do potwierdzenia
   tożsamości zostaną wykorzystane wyłącznie do przetworzenia danego
   wniosku. Aby skorygować dowolne informacje osobowe użytkownika, należy
   przesłać wniosek o korektę zgodnie z tą samą, przedstawioną powyżej
   procedurą.

   Należy pamiętać, że w niektórych jurysdykcjach użytkownik ma również
   prawo do złożenia skargi do organu ds. ochrony danych (“Data Protection
   Authority, DPA”) odnośnie gromadzenia i wykorzystywania przez Firmę
   swoich danych osobowych. Więcej informacji na ten temat można uzyskać w
   lokalnym organie ds. ochrony danych.

Zachowywanie informacji

   Firma będzie z reguły zachowywać dane osobowe użytkownika przez cały
   okres wymagany do realizacji celów określonych w niniejszej Polityce
   prywatności. Pewne informacje mogą jednak być przez Firmę zachowywane
   dłużej, zgodnie z wymogami obowiązującego prawa (np. z uwagi na
   przepisy podatkowe, księgowe lub inne wymogi prawne) lub do
   uzasadnionych celów biznesowych. Gdy podstawy dalszego przetwarzania
   danych osobowych użytkownika przestaną już obowiązywać, Firma usunie
   lub anonimizuje je zgodnie z obowiązującym prawem (chociaż może być
   konieczne zachowanie kopii z pamięci podręcznej lub archiwum przez
   określony czas, dopóki usunięcie informacji nie stanie się możliwe).

   Firma może przechowywać informacje o odbiorcach treści, dopóki
   użytkownik pozostaje w relacji z oprogramowaniem Interaktywnych usług
   telewizyjnych Firmy. Informacje o wyświetlanych treściach mogą być
   przechowywane przez maksymalnie dziesięć (10) lat od daty ostatniej
   interakcji systemów Interaktywnych usług telewizyjnych Firmy z danym
   urządzeniem, chyba że użytkownik zwróci się do Firmy z prośbą o
   usunięcie tych informacji zgodnie z przedstawionymi powyżej
   instrukcjami.

Komunikacja w celach promocyjnych

   Firma może sporadycznie wysyłać użytkownikowi komunikaty marketingowe
   dotyczące naszych produktów i usług, zgodnie z preferencjami danej
   osoby. Użytkownik może zrezygnować z otrzymywania wiadomości
   promocyjnych od Firmy w dowolnym momencie, postępując zgodnie z
   instrukcjami zawartymi w treści tych wiadomości (często w postaci
   powiadomienia lub odnośnika u dołu wiadomości). W przypadku rezygnacji
   Firma może nadal przesyłać użytkownikowi komunikaty niezwiązane z
   promocjami, takie jak wiadomości dotyczące konta lub bieżących relacji
   biznesowych z użytkownikiem.

Powiadomienia Push na urządzeniach mobilnych

   Za zgodą użytkownika Firma może wysyłać powiadomienia Push o
   charakterze promocyjnym lub innym na urządzenie mobilne użytkownika.
   Użytkownik może w dowolnej chwili wyłączyć te komunikaty poprzez zmianę
   ustawień powiadomień na swoim urządzeniu mobilnym.

Wycofanie zgody

   O ile Firma polega na zgodzie użytkownika na przetwarzanie jego danych
   osobowych, użytkownik ma prawo w dowolnym momencie tę zgodę wycofać.

Podstawa prawna przetwarzania danych (EOG)

   Jeśli użytkownik jest osobą fizyczną z obszaru EOG, podstawa prawna
   Firmy do gromadzenia i wykorzystywania jego danych osobowych zależy od
   specyfiki informacji osobowych oraz konkretnego kontekstu, w którym są
   one gromadzone. Firma będzie jednak zwykle gromadzić dane osobowe
   użytkownika wyłącznie w następujących przypadkach: 1) gdy uzyskała
   zgodę użytkownika na takie działanie, 2) gdy potrzebuje danych
   osobowych do realizacji umowy z użytkownikiem (np. do dostarczenia
   użytkownikowi danej usługi) lub 3) gdy przetwarzanie danych leży w
   uzasadnionym interesie Firmy lub strony trzeciej i nie narusza ochrony
   danych użytkownika ani podstawowych praw i wolności. W niektórych
   przypadkach Firma może być też prawnie zobowiązana do pobrania
   informacji osobowych od użytkownika lub w inny sposób wymagać danych
   osobowych w celu ochrony żywotnych interesów użytkownika lub innej
   osoby.

   O ile Firma polega na zgodzie użytkownika na przetwarzanie jego danych
   osobowych, użytkownik ma prawo w dowolnym momencie tę zgodę wycofać lub
   jej odmówić. Należy zaznaczyć, że działanie takie nie ma wpływu na
   praworządność przetwarzania informacji w oparciu o przyznaną zgodę
   przed jej wycofaniem.

   Jeśli Firma poprosi użytkownika o podanie danych osobowych w celu
   spełnienia wymagań prawnych lub realizacji z użytkownikiem umowy,
   zostanie to jednoznacznie wskazane w danym czasie; Firma poinformuje
   też użytkownika, czy podanie danych osobowych jest obowiązkowe, czy też
   nie (oraz przedstawi ewentualne konsekwencje niepodania informacji).
   Podobnie, jeśli Firma gromadzi i wykorzystuje dane osobowe użytkownika
   w oparciu o uzasadnione interesy Firmy (lub strony trzeciej), które nie
   zostały opisane w niniejszej Polityce, podmiot tychże uzasadnionych
   interesów zostanie użytkownikowi przedstawiony w odnośnym czasie.

   Wszelkie pytania dotyczące podstaw prawnych gromadzenia i
   wykorzystywania danych osobowych użytkownika przez Firmę oraz więcej
   informacji na ten temat można uzyskać kontaktując się z nami pod
   adresem privacy@samba.tva lub przekazując je w sposób opisany poniżej w
   sekcji “Kontakt z nami”.

Prawa argentyńskich podmiotów danych i podstawy prawne przetwarzania ich
informacji

   Należy mieć na uwadze, że jeśli użytkownik jest podmiotem danych w
   Argentynie, ma on prawo do dostępu, usuwania, aktualizowania lub
   korekty swoich danych osobowych zgodnie z argentyńską ustawą o ochronie
   danych osobowych.

   Jeśli użytkownik jest osobą fizyczną z Argentyny, podstawa prawna Firmy
   do przetwarzania jego danych, jak też gromadzenia ich i
   wykorzystywania, zależy od specyfiki informacji osobowych oraz
   konkretnego kontekstu, w którym są one gromadzone. Firma będzie jednak
   zwykle gromadzić dane osobowe użytkownika wyłącznie w następujących
   przypadkach: 1) gdy uzyskała zgodę użytkownika na takie działanie, oraz
   2) gdy istnieje umowny związek pomiędzy użytkownikiem a firmą Samba TV
   wynikający z faktu użytkowania naszych produktów i usług.

   Właściciel danych osobowych ma prawo do wykonywania praw oraz prawo
   dostępu do swoich informacji bezpłatnie, w odstępach czasu nie
   krótszych niż sześć miesięcy, chyba że wystąpi uprawniony interes do
   takiego postępowania, zgodnie z art. 14 ust. 3 Ustawy nr 25 326.
   Ponadto, właściciel danych osobowych ma również prawo do aktualizacji
   lub żądania usunięcia swoich informacji osobowych zgodnie z art. 16
   Ustawy 25 326.

   Ustawy nr 25 326, ma prawo rozpatrywać skargi i roszczenia zgłaszane w

   dotyczącą gromadzenia i wykorzystania swoich danych osobowych przez
   firmę Samba TV, powinny skontaktować się z Agencją ds. dostępu do
   informacji publicznej (Agency for Access to Public Information) pod

   الفقدان والسرقة وسوء الاستخدام والاستخدام غير المرخص والإفصاح عنها
   وتبديلها وإتلافها.

التحويلات الدولية

   Samba TV يوجد مقرها في الولايات المتحدة ولديها حاليًا شركات فرعية في
   المملكة المتحدة وبولندا وتايوان. في المستقبل ، قد ننشئ أيضًا شركات
   فرعية وفروعًا إضافية في بلدان أخرى.

   لتسهيل عملياتنا والمساعدة في تقديم خدماتنا ، يجوز لنا نقل المعلومات
   الشخصية إلى الولايات المتحدة وأي دولة أخرى تعمل فيها الشركات التابعة
   لنا ، والشركات التابعة ، والبائعين ، والمستشارين ، وموفري الخدمات. على
   سبيل المثال ، قد نقوم بنقل معلوماتك الشخصية إلى خوادم سامبا في الولايات
   المتحدة لتزويدك بالتوصيات ذات الصلة في Hotlist.

   قد يكون للدول التي قد ننقل فيها معلوماتك الشخصية قوانين مختلفة ، وربما
   لا تكون وقائية ، مثل قوانين بلد إقامتك.

   عندما نقوم بنقل معلوماتك الشخصية في الخارج ، سنتخذ ضمانات مناسبة لحماية
   المعلومات وفقًا لسياسة الخصوصية هذه ، ونسعى لضمان امتثال المستلمين في
   الخارج لقوانين الخصوصية المعمول بها.

   بالنسبة لعمليات نقل البيانات من المنطقة الاقتصادية الأوروبية ، فإننا
   نعتمد على البنود التعاقدية القياسية المعتمدة من المفوضية الأوروبية
   لتمكين نقل المعلومات الشخصية إلى مناطق خارج المنطقة الاقتصادية
   الأوروبية. يمكنك طلب نسخة من هذه البنود القياسية التي وافقت عليها
   اللجنة عن طريق الاتصال بنا كما هو محدد في قسم الاتصال الولايات المتحدة
   أدناه.

   يرجى ملاحظة أنه بالنسبة لعمليات نقل البيانات التي تتضمن بيانات شخصية من
   مواد البيانات الأرجنتينية ، سوف نعتمد على مبادئ ومعايير بنود العقد
   النموذجية التي وافقت عليها الوكالة الأرجنتينية لحماية البيانات في
   القرار 60 / E / 2016 ، لنقل البيانات الشخصية إلى البلدان أنه وفقًا
   للوكالة ، لا توفر مستوى مناسبًا لحماية البيانات.

   إذا كنت ترغب في مزيد من المعلومات ، فلا تتردد في الاتصال بنا من خلال
   البريد الإلكتروني أو على العنوان الموجود في قسم الاتصال بنا.

حقوقك وخياراتك

   فيما يلي الحقوق والخيارات التي نقدمها فيما يتعلق بالممارسات الموضحة في
   هذه السياسة.

خدمات التلفزيون التفاعلي والذكي

   نطلب من الشركات المصنعة للتلفزيونات تزويدك بنظام حرية الاختيار (Opt-in)
   من أجل إتاحة خدمات التلفزيون التفاعلي التي نقدمها (التي تجمع معلومات عن
   نسبة مشاهدة المحتوى). ويُقدم نظام opt-in عادةً في أول مرة تقوم بإعداد
   تلفزيونك الذكي لأول مرة؛ أو بعد تلقي تلفزيونك الذكي تحديث للنظام يشمل
   خدمة التلفزيون التفاعلي التي نقدمها.

   تستطيع الاشتراك في خدمات التلفزيون التفاعلي التي نقدمها أو إلغاء
   الاشتراك فيها في أي وقت يكون فيه تلفزيونك متصلًا بالإنترنت. يمكنك عادةً
   العثور على ميزة التعطيل والتوافق في منطقة “الإعدادات ” في التلفزيون
   الذكي أو داخل واجهة مستخدم خدمة TV Interactive. إذا واجهتك مشكلة في
   العثور على هذه الميزة ، فيجب عليك الاتصال بمصنّع التليفزيون لتحديد
   الموقع الدقيق. إذا ألغيت الاشتراك بخدمات التلفزيون التفاعلي التي
   نقدمها، لن نتمكن من جمع معلومات عن مشاهدة التلفزيون خلال هذه الخدمة.
   ومع ذلك ، لا يزال بإمكاننا تلقي معلومات مشاهدة المحتوى ، كما هو موضح
   أعلاه في قسم “مجموعة المعلومات ” ، عند مشاهدة المحتوى عبر بعض تطبيقات
   التلفزيون الذكي.

   أيضًا ، إذا قمت بإلغاء الاشتراك في خدمات التليفزيون الذكي الخاصة بنا ،
   فلن تكون قادرًا على الاستفادة من ميزاتنا التفاعلية على التلفزيون الذكي
   الخاص بك ؛ أو ميزات التطبيقات الأخرى التي تعتمد على خدمات التلفزيون
   الذكي لتشغيلها (بعد أن قمت بتفويض استخدامها) ، مثل تلقي توصيات المحتوى
   استنادًا إلى العروض التي تحبها أو تفاعلها أو لعبها مع برامجك المفضلة
   باستخدام جهاز التلفزيون عن بعد أو الهاتف المحمول ، الوصول إلى المحتوى
   والعروض الحصرية ، واستئناف عرض من المكان الذي توقفت عنده ، وتلقي
   الإشعارات عندما يعود العرض الذي كنت تشاهده من الإعلانات.

   يمكنك أيضًا اختيار تمكين تتبع الإعلان المحدود من قائمة الخصوصية ضمن
   إعدادات التلفزيون التفاعلي على التلفزيون الذكي الخاص بك. إذا قمت بذلك ،
   فإن منصتنا الإعلانية ستقوم باختيار الرقم التعريفي للإعلان Samba TV من
   تلقي الإعلانات المستهدفة استنادًا إلى معلومات عرض المحتوى من خدمات
   التليفزيون الذكي ، بغض النظر عن الجهاز الذي تستخدمه. لاحظ أنه عندما
   تريد إلغاء ربط البيانات المرتبطة بمعرف الإعلان Samba TV ، يمكنك ببساطة
   إعادة تعيينه. يرجى التحقق من الشركة المصنعة للتلفزيون للتعرف على الموقع
   الدقيق لهذه الميزات. إذا لم تتمكن من العثور عليها أو لم تقم الشركة
   المصنعة للتلفزيون بتمكينها ، فالرجاء الاتصال بنا على
   privacy-support@samba.tv.

   إذا كنت تتنوي بيع جهاز التلفزيون الذكي الخاص بك أو التخلي عنه بطريقة
   أخرى ، فيجب عليك إجراء “إعادة ضبط إعدادات المصنع”. إن هذه الخطوة ستؤدي
   إلي 1) إعادة تعيين معرف الإعلان الخاص ب Samba TV ، و 2) السماح للمالك
   الجديد للتلفزيون باختيار ما إذا كان يرغب في الاشتراك من عدمه في خدمات
   سامبا. إذا كنت تبيع أو تُخلي التلفزيون الذكي الخاص بك دون إجراء “إعادة
   تعيين إعدادات المصنع ” ، فقد يتم إسناد معلومات غير صحيحة لك عن المالك
   الجديد.

الويب وتطبيقات الجوال

   Samba TV هو عضو نشط في مبادرة الإعلان على الشبكة (“NAI “) ، وهي جمعية
   صناعية تقوم بتطوير السياسات حول خصوصية المستهلك عبر الإنترنت في سياق
   الإعلان القائم على الاهتمامات. Samba TV يتوافق مع مدونة قواعد السلوك
   الخاصة بـ NAI. تمشيا مع التزامنا بمبادئ NAI ، فإننا نوفر لك وسيلة
   لإلغاء الاشتراك في الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات استنادًا إلى تصفح
   الويب واستخدام تطبيقات الجوال:
     * متصفحات الانترنت:
       يمكنك إلغاء الاشتراك في السماح لـ Samba TV باستخدام معلومات تصفح
       الويب الخاصة بك لأغراض الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات عبر زيارة
       هذا الرابط المخصص لإلغاء الاشتراك:
       http://optout.networkadvertising.org أو الوصول إلى “إلغاء الاشتراك
       في Samba TV الإعلانات” المتوفرة على
       https://samba.tv/legal/privacy-policy/.
     * أجهزة محمولة:
       بالنسبة لأكثر الطرق فاعلية وأحدثها للحد من تتبع الإعلانات على جهازك
       الجوال، يُرجى الرجوع إلى إعدادات نظام تشغيل جهازك الجوال لتعرف كيف
       يمكنك إلغاء الاشتراك بالإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات أو إعادة
       تعيين مُعرّف الإعلانات لجهازك الجوال لإلغاء ربط المعلومات التي كانت
       مرتبطة سابقًا بمُعرّف الإعلانات.

   قد تتعلم المزيد عن الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات ، بالإضافة إلى
   الأطر ذات الصلة ذاتية التنظيم – والشركات مثل Samba TV التي تسعى جاهدة
   لاحتضان مثل هذه الأنظمة – من خلال زيارة NAI
   (https://www.networkadvertising.org ) أو تحالف الإعلان الرقمي
   (http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org).

ملفات تعريف الارتباط والتخزين المحلي

   يمكنك دائمًا ، إذا رغبت في ذلك، أن تختار ضبط المتصفح الخاص بك لحذف أو
   رفض ملفات تعريف الارتباط للمتصفح أو لتفريغ التخزين المحلي. يرجى العلم

   المحلي، قد يؤثر ذلك على توافر وعمل خدماتنا.

معلومات الحساب والطلبات

   وفقًا للقانون المعمول به ، قد يكون لديك الحق في الوصول إلى المعلومات
   الشخصية التي نحتفظ بها عنك أو تحديثها أو حذفها ، بما في ذلك حذف معلومات
   عرض المحتوى. هذا يعني أنه قد يكون لديك الحق في 1) أن تكون على علم
   بالمعلومات الشخصية التي نجمعها ، وكيف نستخدمها ، وما هي المعلومات
   الشخصية التي شاركناها مع أطراف ثالثة ، وأن يتم تزويدنا بنسخة من هذه
   المعلومات ؛ و 2) إجراء تصحيحات أو حذف المعلومات إذا لم تكن دقيقة أو تمت

   من منتجات وخدمات Samba TV. وإلا يرجى تقديم طلب خطي باستخدام التفاصيل
   الواردة في قسم الاتصال بنا أدناه.

   علاوة على ذلك ، إذا كنت من أقاليم معينة ، فقد يكون لك الحق في ممارسة
   حقوق إضافية متاحة لك بموجب القوانين المعمول بها ، بما في ذلك الحقوق
   الأوسع للوصول إلى معلوماتك الشخصية ومسحها ، أو الحق في الاعتراض على أو
   تقييد معالجة معلوماتك الشخصية ، أو الحق في نقل البيانات في ظروف معينة.
   إذا كنت ترغب في تقديم مثل هذا الطلب ، فيرجى الاتصال بنا على
   privacy@samba.tv أو كما هو موضح أدناه في قسم “اتصل بنا”.

   سننظر في جميع الطلبات وفقًا للقوانين السارية. للحصول على إمكانية الوصول
   إلى معلوماتكم يجوز لنا أن نطلب منكم تقديم معلومات إضافية لتأكيد هويتكم.
   ولن يتم استخدام معلومات التأكيد هذه إلاّ فـقـط لمعالجة طلبكم. ولتصحيح
   أي معلومات لدينا عنكم، يـُرجى إرسال طلب التصحيح بإتباع نفس التعليمات
   الواردة أعلاه.

   تذكر أنه في بعض الولايات القضائية ، يحق لك أيضًا تقديم شكوى إلى هيئة
   حماية البيانات (“DPA “) حول جمعنا لمعلوماتك الشخصية واستخدامها. لمزيد
   من المعلومات ، يرجى الاتصال DPA المحلية الخاصة بك.

جمع المعلومات

   سنحتفظ بشكل عام بمعلوماتك الشخصية طالما كان ذلك ضروريًا لتحقيق الأغراض
   الموضحة في سياسة الخصوصية هذه. ومع ذلك ، يجوز لنا الاحتفاظ بمعلومات
   معينة كما هو مطلوب بموجب القانون المعمول به (مثل الضرائب أو المحاسبة أو
   المتطلبات القانونية الأخرى) ، أو لأغراض تجارية مشروعة. عندما لا يكون
   لدينا أي أساس لمواصلة معالجة معلوماتك الشخصية ، سنقوم إما بحذفها أو
   جعلها مجهولة وفقًا للقوانين المعمول بها (على الرغم من أننا قد نحتاج إلى
   الاحتفاظ بالنسخ المخزنة مؤقتًا أو المؤرشفة لفترة معينة حتى يصبح الحذف
   ممكناً).

   ويجوز لنا تخزين “معلومات نسبة مشاهدة المحتوى” طالما كانت لديكم علاقة
   ببرنامجنا للتلفزيون التفاعلي. ويجوز تخزين “معلومات مشاهدة المحتوى” لمدة
   تصل حتى (10) عشر سنوات من آخـر مرة تواجهت فيه أنظمتنا للتلفزيون
   التفاعلي مع جهاز بعينه، مـا لم تطلبوا منا حذف تلك المعلومات وذلك بإتباع
   التعليمات الواردة أعلاه.

المراسلات الترويجية

   من وقت لآخر ، قد نرسل إليك اتصالات تسويقية حول منتجاتنا وخدماتنا ،
   وفقًا لتفضيلاتك. يجوز لك إلغاء الاشتراك في استقبال الرسائل الترويجية
   التي نرسلها عبر اتباع الإرشادات المتضمنة في هذه الرسائل (عادةً ما تكون
   في صيغة إشعار أو رابط في أسفل الرسالة). وفي حالة إلغائك الاشتراك فيها،
   يجوز لنا أن نرسل لك مراسلات غير ترويجية، مثل المراسلات التي تخص حسابك
   أو علاقاتنا التجارية المتواصلة.

إعلامات دفع المحمول

   بعد الحصول على موافقتك، يجوز لنا أن نرسل إخطارات أو تنبيهات لحظية غير
   ترويجية إلى جهازك الجوال. ويمكنك إيقاف هذه الرسائل في أي وقت من خلال
   تغيير إعدادات الإشعارات على جهازك الجوال.

سحب الموافقة

   عندما نعتمد على موافقتك على معالجة معلوماتك الشخصية ، يحق لك سحب
   موافقتك في أي وقت.

الأساس القانوني للمعالجة (EEA)

   إذا كنت فردًا من المنطقة الاقتصادية الأوروبية ، فسيعتمد الأساس القانوني
   لجمع معلوماتك الشخصية واستخدامها على المعلومات الشخصية المعنية والسياق
   المحدد الذي نجمعه فيه. ومع ذلك ، فإننا عادةً ما نجمع المعلومات الشخصية
   منك فقط عندما: 1) نحصل على موافقتك على القيام بذلك ، 2) حيث نحتاج إلى
   المعلومات الشخصية لتنفيذ عقد معك (مثل تقديم الخدمات إليك) ، أو 3) حيث
   تكون المعالجة في مصالحنا المشروعة أو الخاصة بطرف ثالث ولا يتم تجاوزها
   من قبل مصالح حماية البيانات الخاصة بك أو الحقوق والحريات الأساسية. في
   بعض الحالات ، قد يكون لدينا أيضًا التزام قانوني بجمع معلومات شخصية منك
   ، أو قد تحتاج إلى معلومات شخصية لحماية مصالحك الحيوية أو مصالح شخص آخر.

   عندما نعتمد على موافقتك على معالجة المعلومات الشخصية ، يحق لك سحب
   موافقتك أو رفضها في أي وقت. يرجى ملاحظة أن هذا لا يؤثر على قانونية
   المعالجة بناءً على الموافقة المسبقة لسحبها.

   إذا طلبنا منك تقديم معلومات شخصية للامتثال لمتطلب قانوني أو لتنفيذ عقد
   معك ، فسوف نوضح ذلك في الوقت المناسب ونعلمك ما إذا كان توفير معلوماتك
   الشخصية إلزاميًا أم لا (بالإضافة إلى من العواقب المحتملة إذا كنت لا
   توفر ذلك). وبالمثل ، إذا جمعنا معلوماتك الشخصية ونستخدمها اعتمادًا على
   مصالحنا الشرعية (أو الجهات الخارجية) التي لم يتم وصفها بالفعل في هذه
   السياسة ، فسوف نوضح لك في الوقت المناسب ما هي تلك المصالح الشرعية.

   إذا كان لديك أي أسئلة حول أو تحتاج إلى مزيد من المعلومات حول الأساس
   القانوني الذي نجمع عليه ونستخدم معلوماتك الشخصية ، يرجى الاتصال بنا على
   privacy@samba.tv أو كما هو موضح أدناه في قسم “اتصل بنا”.

   الوصول إلى بياناتك الشخصية أو حذفها أو تحديثها أو تعديلها بموجب قانون
   حماية البيانات في الأرجنتين.

   إذا كنت فردًا من الأرجنتين ، فسيعتمد الأساس القانوني لمعالجة بياناتك
   الشخصية ، وكذلك جمع معلوماتك الشخصية واستخدامها على المعلومات الشخصية
   المعنية والسياق المحدد الذي نجمعه فيه. ومع ذلك ، سنقوم عادة بجمع
   المعلومات الشخصية منك فقط عندما: 1) لدينا موافقتك على القيام بذلك ، و
   2) وجود علاقة تعاقدية بينك وبين Samba TV بحكم استخدام منتجاتنا
   وخدماتنا.

   يمتلك مالك البيانات الشخصية الحق في ممارسة وحق الوصول إلى بياناته

       sistem, identifikatore uređaja, korišćenje resursa i evidencije
       grešaka. Takođe možemo registrovati kada su uređaji dostupni za
       povezivanje sa Pametnom TV putem, na primjer, slanja signala sa
       vašeg uređaja na obližnjoj Pametnoj TV; ili, koristeći naše usluge
       Pametne TV da biste vidjeli koji su uređaji povezani na istu mrežu
       kao i Pametna TV. Ove informacije možemo koristiti i da, na
       primjer, učinimo lakšim povezivanje vašeg uređaja na vašu Pametnu
       TV.
     * Informacije o pregledu sadržaja: Mi primamo informacije o
       sadržajima koje pregledate ili ste u dodiru s njima kroz Pametnu TV
       koja integriše naš Interaktivni TV servis ili kroz aplikacije
       Pametne TV, kao što je Hotlist) (”Informacije o pregledanim
       sadržajima”). Informacije o pregledu sadržaja uključuju stvari kao
       što su naslov sadržaja, akcije koje se preduzimaju tokom gledanja
       sadržaja i dužina vremena kada ste ga gledali.
       Mi primamo ove informacije na dva različita načina:
          + aplikacije Pametne TV : Možda ćemo dobiti takve informacije o
            pregledanju kada koristite naše aplikacije Pametne TV ili
            aplikacije drugih Pametnih TV-a koje koriste naše integrisane
            usluge.
          + Smart TV usluge: Kada se uključite u naše usluge Pametne TV
            usluge, mi ćemo možda prepoznati sadržaj koji se prikazuje
            preko vašeg TV-a. Imajte na umu da možemo prepoznati samo
            javni sadržaj, kao što su određene emisije i filmovi. Nećemo
            znati kada gledate, na primjer, kućne video zapise.
     * Precizne informacije o lokaciji:Uz vaše odobrenje, mi možemo
       prikupljati informacije o specifičnoj lokaciji vašeg uređaja,
       uključujući i to kad pristupate ili koristite neku od naših
       mobilnih aplikacija koja koristi naše Integrisane usluge.
     * Informacije koje se prikupljaju preko kolačića i drugih
       tehnologija:Mi koristimo razne tehnologije za prikupljanje
       informacija kad se služite našim uslugama. Ove tehnologije
       uključuju kolačiće, lokalno skladištenje i web-tačkice. Kolačići i
       lokalno skladištenje su male datoteke s podacima koje se sačuvaju
       na vašem uređaju kad posjećujete internet stranicu. Kolačići i
       lokalno skladištenje omogućavaju nama i našim klijentima da pružaju
       funkcije i funkcionalnosti (kao što su zadržavanje vas
       prijavljenih), da mjere popularnosi naših usluga i prate njihove
       performanse.
       Web-tačkice (ili piksel tagovi) su elektronske sličice koje se mogu
       koristiti u našim uslugama ili elektronskoj pošti kako bi pomogle u
       isporuci kolačića, brojanju posjeta stranici i utvrđivanju učinka
       marketinških kampanja putem elektronske pošte. Naši kolačići ističu
       dvadeset četiri (24) mjeseca od kad je naš sistem zadnji put bio u
       doticaju s određenim računarom ili uređajem.
     * Informacije iz integriranih usluga:Mi prikupljamo informacije kad
       posjećujete ili koristite internet stranice i aplikacije trećih
       strana koje koriste naše Integrisane usluge, uključujući
       prikupljanje preko kolačića i drugih prethodno opisanih
       tehnologija. Na primjer, kad odaberete da uparite aplikaciju
       emitera sa svojim TV-om, taj emiter može koristiti našu tehnologiju
       za sinhronizaciju vašeg iskustva u svojim mobilnim aplikacijama dok
       vi gledate emisiju na svom TV-u. Također, aplikacije i internet
       stranice trećih strana mogu koristiti naše usluge za mjerenje i
       oglašavanje da bi bolje shvatili kako se njihove usluge koriste i
       bili u stanju da objavljuju reklame zasnovane na interesovanjima.
       Informacije koje prikupljamo uključuju informacije o vašem
       korištenju tih internet stranica i aplikacija, kao i informacije
       koje nam te stranice i aplikacije omogućavaju da prikupimo kroz
       njihove usluge. Na primjer, dobavljač usluga video-striminga može
       nam omogućiti da primamo informacije o sadržaju koji vi gledate,
       tako da naša usluga za preporuke može davati sugestije za dodatne
       sadržaje koji bi vam se mogli svidjeti.
       Možete se odlučiti za pružanje informacija putem naših integrisanih
       usluga tako što ćete pratiti uputstva pod naslovom “Veb i
       aplikacije za mobilne uređaje” u odjeljku “Vaša prava i izbori” u
       nastavku tekst.
     * Informacije koje sakupljamo iz drugih izvora:Mi pribavljamo
       informacije i iz drugih izvora i kombiniramo ih sa informacijama
       koje smo prikupili kroz naše usluge. Na primjer, mi prikupljamo
       informacije od dobavljača podataka i servisa za razmjenu reklamnih
       usluga, uključujući pretpostavljene demografske podatke i
       interesovanja i podatke o vašem angažmanu vezanom za naše oglase.
       Takođe, ako kreirate vaš Samba TV korisnički nalog ili se prijavite
       na njega preko usluga socijalnih medija, mi ćemo imati pristup
       određenim informacijama sa tog servisa u skladu s postavkama i
       ovlaštenjem koje ste nam dali kroz taj servis.

Upotreba informacija

     * Obezbjeđivanje, održavanje i poboljšanje naših usluga (na primjer,
       koristimo informacije koje sakupljamo kako bismo unaprijedili
       korisničko iskustvo, popravili kvarove na uslugama, testirali naše
       sigurnosne sisteme i povećali tehničke karakteristike);
     * Praćenje i analiziranje korišćenja naših usluga;
     * Personalizaciju naših usluga i davanja preporuka, oglasa, sadržaja
       i funkcija koje odgovaraju vašim interesovanjima;
     * Poboljšavanje naših sistema oglašavanja i mjerenja kako bismo vam
       mogli prikazati relevantne oglase na i sa naših usluga (na primjer,
       ako ste zainteresirani za emisije o kuhanju, možemo vam pružiti
       oglase za nove TV programe vezane za kuhanje);
     * Komunikaciju sa vama o proizvodima, uslugama, ponudama i događajima
       koje nudi kompanija Samba TV ili druge, i pružanje sadržaja za koji
       smatramo da će vam biti zanimljiv;
     * Davanje odgovora na vaše komentare i pitanja i pružanje usluga
       klijentima; i,
     * Otkrivanje, istraživanje i sprječavanje lažnih i drugih ilegalnih
       aktivnosti i zaštita prava, sigurnosti i imovine Samba TV i drugih.

   Da pojasnimo, informacije koje dobivamo o vama kroz korištenje jednog
   uređaja ili Pametne TV mogu se kombinirati s informacijama koje o vama
   dobivamo kroz vašu upotrebu drugog uređaja ili Pametne TV. Na primjer,
   ako znamo da volite gledati fudbal na vašoj Pametnoj TV, mi vam možemo
   prikazati na vašem mobilnom telefonu fudbalske statistike u realnom
   vremenu. Uvijek se možete isključiti iz prijema takvog prilagođenog
   sadržaja na kućnim uređajima tako što ćete pratiti uputstva navedena u
   odjeljku “Vaša prava i izbori” u nastavku.

       našeg poslovanja od strane druge kompanije.
     * Kada vi niste direktno identifikovani:Možemo dijeliti određene
       informacije, kao što su Informacije o pregledu sadržaja, koje se
       same po sebi ne identifikuju vas kao pojedinca direktno. Te
       informacije možemo dijeliti sa svojim partnerima i klijentima
       (uključujući i za potrebe oglašavanja i analitike) i u javnosti.

       ljudi gledalo određenu TV emisiju. Ili možemo dijeliti podatke o
       vašem uređaju sa platformama za oglašavanje kako bismo vam

       podataka koje možemo podijeliti uključuju ID-ove uređaja, reklamne
       ID-e, IP adrese, isprekidane/šifrovane verzije vaše e-adrese ili
       drugog identifikatora, ili pseudonimne ID-ove.

Analitičke i reklamne usluge koje pružaju drugi

   gubitka, zloupotrebe i neovlaštenog pristupanja, otkrivanja, mijenjanja
   i uništavanja.

Međunarodni transferi

   Samba TV ima sjedište u Sjedinjenim Državama, a trenutno ima podružnice
   u Ujedinjenom Kraljevstvu, Poljskoj i Tajvanu. U budućnosti možemo
   osnovati i dodatne filijale i podružnice u drugim zemljama.

   Da bismo olakšali naše poslovanje i pomogli u pružanju naših usluga, mi
   možemo prenositi lične podatke u SAD i bilo koju drugu zemlju u kojoj
   posluju naše povezane firme, podružnice, prodavci, konsultanti i

   Samba servere u SAD kako bismo vam pružali odgovarajuće preporuke u
   Hotlisti.

   Zemlje u koje možemo prenositi vaše lične informacije mogu imati zakone
   koji su različiti i potencijalno nisu toliko zaštićujući kao što su
   zakoni zemlje u kojoj vi živite.

   Kada prenosimo vaše lične informacije u inostranstvo, mi ćemo preduzeti
   odgovarajuće zaštitne mjere da zaštitimo informacije u skladu sa ovom
   Politikom privatnosti i pokušat ćemo obezbijediti da strani korisnici

Vaša prava i izbori

   U donjem tekstu navedeni su prava i izbori koje pružamo u vezi sa
   praksama opisanim u ovoj Politici.

Interaktivne i Pametne TV usluge

   Mi od proizvođača TV uređaja zahtijevamo da vam osiguraju opciju
   uključivanja (opt-in) koja omogućava naše Pametne TV servise, koji
   prikupljaju informacije o gledaocima određenog sadržaja. Opcija opt-in
   će vam se obično prikazati kad prvi put vršite postavke vaše Pametne TV
   – ili nakon što vaša Pametna TV dobije ažurirani softver koji uključuje
   naše Pametne TV usluge.

   Trebali biste biti u mogućnosti da uđete u naše Pametne TV usluge ili
   izađete iz njih kad god je vaš TV povezan na internet. Obično možete
   pronaći našu funkciju izlaza ili ulaza za ove opcije u zoni
   “podešavanja” na vašoj Pametnoj TV ili u korisničkom interfejsu za
   Interaktivne TV usluge. Ako imate problema sa pronalaženjem ove
   funkcije, obratite se proizvođaču televizije da biste utvrdili tačnu
   lokaciju. Ako izaberete opciju izlaza sa našeg Interaktivnog TV
   servisa, mi nećemo dalje prikupljati informacije o gledanju TV-a kroz
   ovaj servis. Međutim, i dalje možemo primati informacije o
   pregledavanju sadržaja, kao što je opisano u odjeljku “Sakupljanje
   informacija”, kada gledate sadržaje putem određenih aplikacija Pametne
   TV.

   Takođe, ako se isključite iz opcije za naše Pametne TV usluge, nećete
   moći da iskoristite naše interaktivne funkcije na Pametnoj TV; niti na
   rad funkcija drugih aplikacija koje se oslanjaju na Pametne TV usluge
   (nakon što ste odobrili njihovu upotrebu), kao što su primanje
   preporuka za sadržaj na osnovu emisija koje volite, interakcije ili
   igranja zajedno sa vašim omiljenim emisijama pomoću daljinskog ili
   mobilnog uređaja na televizoru, pristup ekskluzivnim sadržajima i
   ponudama, nastavljanje emisije odakle ste stali i prijem obavještenja
   kada se emisija koju ste gledali vraća iz reklama.

   Također možete odabrati da omogućite ograničenje praćenja oglasa iz
   menija Privatnost unutar interaktivnih TV postavki na vašoj Pametnoj
   TV. Ako to učinite, naša reklamna platforma će isključiti vaš ID
   oglašavanja za Samba TV iz opcije primanja ciljanih reklama na osnovu
   informacija o pregledu sadržaja iz usluga Pametne TV, bez obzira na to
   koji uređaj koristite. Imajte na umu da kad god želite da prekinete
   vezu za podatake koji su povezani sa vašim ID-om oglašavanja za Samba
   TV, možete ga jednostavno resetovati. Molimo da provjerite kod
   proizvođača televizije gdje su tačne lokacije ovih funkcija. Ako ih ne
   možete pronaći ili ih vam proizvođač TV-a nije omogućio, molimo
   kontaktirajte nas na privacy-support@samba.tv.

   Ako nameravate da prodate ili na neki drugi način dajete Pametnu TV,
   morate izvršiti “fabrički reset”. Time će se 1) resetovati ID
   oglašavanja Samba TV i 2) dozvoliti novom vlasniku televizije da
   odabere da li želi da se prijavi ili odjavi od Samba usluga. Ako
   prodate ili dajete svoju Pametnu TV bez obavljanja “fabričkog
   resetovanja”, informacije o novom vlasniku mogu biti pogrešno pripisane
   vama.

       kako biste vidjeli kako možete izaći iz oglašavanja zasnovanog na
       interesovanjima ili resetovati ID za oglašavanje na vašem mobilnom
       uređaju i uklonili poveznicu za informacije koje su prethodno bile
       pridružene uz vaš ID za oglašavanje.

   Možete saznati više o oglašavanju zasnovanom na interesovanju, kao i o
   odgovarajućim okvirima samoregulacije – i kompanijama kao što su Samba
   TV , koje teže da prihvate takve režime – posjetom NAI-ju

   sakupljamo, kako ih koristimo, koje lične podatke dijelimo sa trećim
   licima, i da dobijete kopije tih informacija; i 2) da vršite ispravke
   ili brisanja informacija ako one nisu tačne ili su obrađene u
   suprotnosti sa važećim zakonima. Imate mogućnost da ostvarite ova prava

Prikupljanje informacija

   Mi ćemo generalno zadržavati vaše lične informacije koliko god je to
   potrebno kako bismo ispunili svrhe navedene u ovoj Politici
   privatnosti. Međutim, mi možemo zadržati određene informacije kako to
   zahtijeva važeći zakon (kao što su poreski, računovodstveni ili drugi
   zakonski zahtjevi) ili za legitimne poslovne svrhe. Kada nemamo osnove
   za nastavak obrade vaših ličnih podataka, ili ćemo ih izbrisati ili
   načiniti anonimnima, u skladu sa važećim zakonima (iako ćemo možda
   morati zadržati keširane ili arhivirane kopije u određenom periodu, dok
   ne bude moguće njihovo brisanje).

   Mi možemo pohranjivati informacije o pregledu sadržaja sve dok ste vi u
   korisničkom odnosu sa našim softverom za interaktivnu TV. Informacije o
   pregledavanju sadržaja mogu se pohranjivati do deset (10) godina od
   zadnjeg puta kad su naše usluge bile u kontaktu s određenim uređajem,
   osim ako vi od nas ne zatražite da izbrišemo te informacije slijedeći
   gore navedena uputstva.

Promotivne komunikacije

   S vremena na vrijeme, možemo vam slati marketinške komunikacije o našim
   proizvodima i uslugama, u skladu sa vašim željama. Možete odabrati
   opciju da prestanete primati promotivne poruke od nas slijedeći
   uputstva u tim porukama (to će obično biti napomena ili link na dnu
   poruke). Ako odaberete ovu opciju, mi vam i dalje možemo slati
   ne-promotivne poruke, kao što su one o vašem računu ili našim trenutnim
   poslovnim odnosima.

Mobilna iskakajuća obavještenja

   Uz vašu saglasnost, mi vam možemo slati promotivna i ne promotivna
   iskakajuća obavještenja ili upozorenja na vaš mobilni uređaj. Ove
   poruke možete deaktivirati u bilo koje vrijeme izmjenom postavki za
   obavještenja na vašem mobilnom uređaju.

Povlačenje saglasnosti

   Tamo gdje se mi oslanjamo na vašu saglasnost za obradu vaših ličnih
   informacija, vi imate pravo da povučete svoju saglasnost u bilo koje
   vrijeme.

Pravna osnova za obradu (EEA)

   Ako ste osoba iz EEA, naša pravna osnova za prikupljanje i korišćenje
   vaših ličnih podataka zavisiće od ličnih informacija i specifičnog
   konteksta u kojem ga sakupljamo. Međutim, obično ćemo prikupljati lične
   podatke od vas samo ako: 1) imamo vašu saglasnost da to učinimo, 2)
   gdje nam trebaju lične informacije za realizaciju ugovora s vama (kao
   što je pružanje usluga za vas), ili 3) gdje je obrada u legitimnom
   interesu nas ili trećih strana, a nije podređena vašim interesima
   zaštite podataka ili osnovnim pravima i slobodama. U nekim slučajevima
   možemo također imati zakonsku obavezu da sakupljamo lične podatke od
   vas ili će nam inače trebati lične informacije kako bismo zaštitili
   vitalne interese vas ili neke druge osobe.

   Tamo gdje se oslanjamo na vašu saglasnost za obradu ličnih informacija,
   vi imate pravo da povučete ili odbacite svoju saglasnost u bilo koje
   vrijeme. Imajte na umu da ovo ne utiče na zakonitost obrade na osnovu
   pristanka prije njegovog povlačenja.

   Ako tražimo od vas da pružite lične podatke kako bismo ispunili neki
   zakonski zahtev ili realizirali ugovor sa vama, mi ćemo to jasno
   staviti do znanja u relevantno vrijeme i obavijestiti vas da li je
   pružanje vaših ličnih podataka obavezno ili ne (kao i moguće posljedice
   ako ih ne budete pružili). Slično tome, ako sakupljamo i koristimo vaše
   lične podatke oslanjajući se na naše ili legitimne interese naših
   trećih strana koji nisu već opisani u ovoj politici, mi ćemo vam u
   određenom trenutku jasno staviti do znanja koji su to legitimni
   interesi.

   Ako imate bilo kakvih pitanja ili vam trebaju dodatne informacije o
   pravnoj osnovi na kojoj sakupljamo i koristimo vaše lične informacije,
   molimo vas da nas kontaktirate na privacy@samba.tva ili kako je opisano
   ispod u odjeljku “Kontaktirajte nas”.

Декларация за поверителност на Samba TV

   Последна промяна: 28 февруари 2018 г.

   Ние от Free Stream Media Corp. (“Samba TV”, “Samba”, “ние”, “нас” или
   “нашата”) знае, че се интересувате от това как се използва и споделя
   информацията ви. Тази Декларация за поверителност (или “Политика”)
   описва нашите практики, включително избора ви, по отношение на
   информацията, която събираме.

   Тези правила важат за всички наши продукти и услуги (“Услуги на Samba”
   или “Услуги”). Услугите ни включват услугите Smart TV и приложения
   Smart TV (напр. Hotlist и Samba Интерактивна телевизия), нашите
   уебсайтове (включително www.samba.tv) и нашите мобилни приложения.
   Услугите ни включват и нашите продукти и услуги, които могат да бъдат
   интегрирани в уеб сайтове на трети страни, мобилни приложения и
   приложения Smart TV (“Интегрирани услуги”).

   Вашата поверителност има значение за Samba TV. Ако имате някакви
   въпроси, моля свържете се с нас на адрес privacy@samba.tv или както е
   описано по-долу в секцията “Свържете се с нас”.

   Ако намирате за по-лесно да прочетете тази политика в мрежата или на
   хартия, ние сме предоставили двете опции на разположение на нашия
   уебсайт на https://samba.tv/privacy/.

Събиране на информация

Информация, която ни предоставяте

   Ние събираме информацията, която директно ни предоставяте. Например,
   ние събираме информация, когато създавате профил, актуализирате Вашия
   профил, участвате в определени интерактивни функции на Услугите,
   попълвате формуляр, заявка за поддръжка на клиенти или общувате с нас.
   Видовете информация, която събираме, може да включва Вашето име,
   електронен адрес, телефонен номер, интереси и предпочитания,
   местоположение и друга информация, която изберете да ни предоставите.

   Ако ни предоставяте лична информация за някой друг, трябва да сте
   сигурни, че имате право да разкриете тази информация на нас,
   включително и ако сте получили необходимото съгласие от негова страна;
   и че можем да събираме, използваме и разкриваме такава информация за
   целите, описани в тази Декларация за поверителност. Всяко събиране и
   обработка на информация, която сте предоставили за друго лице, ще бъде
   в съответствие с тези правила.

Информация, която получаваме, когато използвате нашите услуги

   Ние получаваме информация за Услугите, които вие и вашето домакинство
   използвате и за начина, по който го правите, като например, когато
   гледате видео на Hotlist, посещавате уебсайт или приложение на трета
   страна, което използва нашите Интегрирани услуги, или взаимодействате с
   нашите реклами и съдържание. Тази информация включва:
     * Информация за регистрационните файлове: Ние автоматично събираме
       стандартни регистрационни файлове, когато използвате нашите Услуги,
       които включват часа и датата на достъп, разгледани страници или
       функции, IP адрес, тип на браузъра, който използвате, и насочващия
       URL.
     * Информация за устройството: Събираме информация за устройствата,
       които използвате за взаимодействие с нашите Услуги. Тази специфична
       за устройството информация може да включва хардуерен модел и марка,
       операционна система, идентификатори на устройства, използваемия
       ресурс и регистрационни файлове за грешки. Може също да записваме,
       когато има устройства, които могат да се свързват със Smart TV,
       например чрез изпращане на сигнал от устройството ви до близкото
       Smart TV; или с помощта на нашите Услуги Smart TV, за да видим
       какви устройства са свързани към същата мрежа като Smart TV. Ние
       може да използваме тази информация, например, за по-лесно свързване
       на Вашето устройство към Вашия Smart TV.
     * Информация за преглеждането на съдържание: Ние получаваме
       информация за съдържанието, което гледате и с което си
       взаимодействате чрез Smart TV, който интегрира нашите Smart TV
       услуги или чрез приложения за Smart TV (“Информация за
       съдържанието, което гледате”). Информацията за съдържанието, което
       гледате включва неща като заглавието на съдържанието, действията,
       предприети при преглеждането на съдържанието, както и
       продължителността на гледане.Ние получаваме тази информация по два
       основни начина:
          + Приложения за Smart TV : Възможно е да получим такава
            информация за гледане, когато използвате нашите приложения за
            Smart TV или Smart TV приложения на трети страни, които
            използват нашите интегрирани услуги.
          + Услуги за Smart TV: Когато се включите в нашите услуги за
            Smart TV, може да разпознаем съдържанието, което се
            възпроизвежда през вашия телевизор. Моля, имайте предвид, че
            можем да разпознаваме само обществено съдържание, като
            например определени предавания и филми. Няма да знаем кога
            гледате например домашни видеоклипове.
     * Точна информация за местоположението: С Ваше съгласие може да
       събираме информация за точното местоположение на устройството Ви,
       включително когато влизате или използвате някои от мобилните ни
       приложения или такива, които използват нашите Интегрирани услуги.
     * Информация, събирана от бисквитки и други технологии:Ние използваме
       различни технологии за събиране на информация, когато си
       взаимодействате с нашите Услуги. Тези технологии включват
       бисквитки, локална памет и уебмаяци. Бисквитките и локалната памет
       са малки файлове с данни, които се съхраняват във Вашето
       устройство, когато посещавате уебсайт. Бисквитките и локалното
       съхранение позволяват на нас и нашите клиенти да предоставяме
       функции и функционалност (като например да държим профила ви
       отворен), да измерваме популярността на нашите услуги и да
       наблюдаваме тяхната продуктивност.Уеб маяците (или пикселни тагове)
       са електронни изображения, които могат да бъдат използвани в нашите
       Услуги или електронни писма в помощ на доставянето на бисквитки,
       отброяването на посещенията на уебсайта и за определяне
       ефективността на маркетингови кампании по електронен адрес. Нашите
       бисквитки изтичат двадесет и четири (24) месеца от последния път, в
       който нашите системи са срещнали конкретен компютър или устройство.
     * Информация от интегрираните услуги: Ние събираме информация, когато
       посетите или използвате уебсайтове и приложения на трети страни,
       които използват нашите Интегрирани услуги, включително чрез
       бисквитки и други технологии, описани по-горе. Например, когато
       решите да сдвоите приложение на телевизионен оператор към Вашия
       телевизор, този телевизионен оператор може да използва нашата
       технология, за да синхронизира Вашите преживявания в мобилните си
       приложения, когато гледате шоу програма на Вашия телевизор. Също
       така, приложенията и уебсайтовете на трети страни могат да
       използват нашите услуги по измерване и реклама, за да могат
       по-добре да разберат използването на техните услуги и да позволят
       показването на реклами въз основа на интересите ви. Информацията,
       която събираме, включва информация за използваните от вас
       уебсайтове и приложения, както и информация, която тези приложения
       или уебсайтове ни позволяват да събираме от техните услуги.
       Например, доставчик на видеострийминг може да ни оторизира да
       получаваме информация относно съдържанието, което Вие гледате, така
       че нашата услуга за препоръчване ще може да предлага допълнително
       съдържание, което може да Ви хареса.Можете да се откажете да
       предоставяте информация чрез нашите интегрирани услуги, като
       следвате указанията в раздела “Уеб и мобилни приложения” в точката
       “Вашите права и избори” по-долу.
     * Информация, която събираме от други източници: Когато законът
       позволява, ние можем също да получим информация от други източници
       и да я комбинираме с информацията, която събраме чрез нашите
       Услуги. Например, ние може да получим информация от доставчици на
       данни и услуги за обмен на реклами, включително предполагаеми
       демографски данни и интереси и данни за Вашия интерес към нашите
       реклами.Също така, ако създадете или влезете във Вашия профил в
       Samba TV посредством услуга на социална медия, ние ще имаме достъп
       до определена информация от тази услуга според настройките и
       упълномощаването, които сте ни предоставили чрез тази услуга.

Използване на информация

   Ние можем да използваме информацията, която събираме, за:
     * Осигуряваме, поддържаме и подобряваме нашите Услуги (например
       използваме информацията, която събираме, за да прецизираме
       потребителския опит, да поправим неизправности в услугата, да
       тестваме нашите системи за сигурност и да увеличим техническите ни
       постижения);
     * Контролираме и анализираме използването на нашите услуги;
     * Персонализираме нашите услуги и изготвяме препоръки, реклами,
       съдържание и функции, които съответстват на вашите интереси;
     * Подобряваме системите ни за рекламиране и измерване, за да можем да
       Ви покажем подходящи реклами на и от нашите Услуги (например, ако
       се интересувате от програми за готвене, може да ви покажем реклами
       за нови телевизионни програми за готвене);
     * Съобщаваме за продуктите, услугите, офертите и събитията,
       предлагани от Samba TV или други и предоставяме съдържание, което
       смятаме, че ще намерите за интересно;
     * Отговаряме на вашите коментари и въпроси и предоставяме обслужване
       на клиенти; и,
     * Откриваме, разследваме и предотвратяваме измамнически и други
       незаконни дейности и защитаваме правата, безопасността и
       собствеността на Samba TV и други.

   За по-голяма яснота, информацията, която получаваме за Вас или Вашето
   домакинство при използване на дадено устройство или Smart TV, може да
   се комбинира с информацията, която получаваме от използваните други
   устройства или Smart телевизори. Например, ако знаем, че обичате да
   гледате футбол на Вашия Smart телевизор, ние можем да Ви показваме
   футболни статистики в реално време на мобилното Ви устройство. Винаги
   можете да се откажете от получаването на такова специално съдържание на
   домашните си устройства, като следвате инструкциите, посочени в
   секцията “Вашите права и избори” по-долу.

Споделяне на информация

Информация, която споделяте

   Когато изпратите мнение в интерактивни зони на нашите уебсайтове или
   приложения, потребителите на тези услуги могат да виждат мненията,
   Вашето потребителско име и кога сте публикували мнението.

   Услугите могат да предлагат възможности за споделяне в социалните мрежи
   и други интегрирани инструменти (като бутона “Харесай” на Facebook), с
   които можете да споделяте вашите действията на нашите Услуги, с другите
   медии и обратно. Използването на такива функции позволява споделянето
   на информация с вашите приятели или с обществеността, според
   настройкитем които сте установили с компанията и които са обект на
   условията за използване и поверителност на тези компании.

Информация, която споделяме

   Можем да споделяме информацията, която събираме за вас с трети страни
   при следните обстоятелства:
     * С Ваше съгласие или по Ваше желание: По ваше желание или ако имаме
       съгласието ви да направим това, ние ще споделяме информация с
       фирми, организации или физически лица извън Samba TV. Когато ни
       упълномощите да споделяме информация за вас с други компании,
       трябва да прегледате техните декларации за поверителност, за да
       разберете как те могат да използват и обработват информацията ви.

       които работят от наше име.
     * За правни причини: Можем да обменяме информация с фирми,
       организации или лица извън Samba TV: в отговор на искане за
       информация, ако считаме, че оповестяването е в съответствие с или
       се изисква от приложимото право или правен процес; ако вярваме, че
       действията ви са в противоречие с нашите потребителски
       споразумения; или за защита на правата, собствеността или

     * Когато не сте пряко идентифицирани: Може да споделяме определена
       информация, като например информация за преглежданото от вас
       съдържание, която само по себе си не ви идентифицира директно като

       партньори и клиенти (включително за рекламни и аналитични цели) и
       обществеността. Можем например, да публикуваме обобщени отчети за

Аналитични и рекламни услуги, предоставяни от други

   Ние наемаме други компании да публикуват реклами от наше име в интернет
   и да ни предоставят аналитични услуги.

   Тези компании може да използват бисквитки, уебмаяци, идентификационни
   номера на устройства и други технологии за събиране на информация
   относно Вашето потребление на Услуги и други уебсайтове и приложения,
   включително информация за Вашия IP адрес, уеббраузър, разгледани
   страници, прекарано време на страниците или в приложенията, линкове,

   достъп, разкриване, промяна и унищожаване.

Международни трансфери

   Samba TV е със седалище в Съединените щати и в момента има дъщерни
   дружества в Обединеното кралство, Полша и Тайван. В бъдеще можем да
   установим и други филиали и дъщерни дружества в други страни.

   За да улесним операциите си и да помогнем при доставката на нашите
   услуги, може да прехвърлим лична информация на САЩ и всяка друга
   страна, където действат нашите филиали, дъщерни дружества, търговци,
   консултанти и доставчици на услуги. Например, можем да прехвърлим
   вашата лична информация към сървърите на Samba в САЩ. за да ви
   предостави съответни препоръки в Hotlist.

   Страните, към които можем да прехвърлим вашата лична информация, могат
   да имат закони, които са различни и потенциално не защитават, колкото
   законите на държавата където пребивавате.

   Когато прехвърляме вашите лични данни в чужбина, ние ще вземем
   необходимите предпазни мерки за защита на информацията в съответствие с
   тази Декларация за поверителност и ще се опитаме да гарантираме, че
   чуждестранните получатели спазват приложимите закони за поверителност.

   За прехвърлянето на данни от ЕИП ние разчитаме на одобрените от
   Европейската комисия стандартни договорни клаузи, които дават
   възможност за прехвърляне на лична информация на територии извън ЕИП.
   Можете да поискате копие от тези стандартни клаузи, одобрени от
   Комисията, като се свържете с нас, както е посочено в секцията Свържете
   се с нас по-долу.

   Моля, обърнете внимание, че за прехвърляне на данни, включващи лични
   данни от аржентинските субекти на данни, ние ще разчитаме на принципите
   и стандартите на модела на договорни клаузи, одобрен от Аржентинската
   агенция за защита на данните в Dispozitie 60/E/2016, за прехвърляне на
   лични данни към държави, които не осигуряват адекватно ниво на защита
   на данните според Агенцията.

   Ако желаете повече информация, моля не се колебайте да се свържете с
   нас чрез електронната поща или на посочения адрес в секцията “Свържете

Вашите права и избори

   По-долу са правата и възможностите, които предлагаме във връзка с
   практиките, описани в тази Политика.

Интерактивни и Smart TV услуги

   Ние изискваме от производителите на телевизори да Ви предоставят
   възможност за абонамент за разрешаване на нашите Интерактивни
   телевизионни услуги, които събират Информация за зрителското поведение.
   Тази възможност за абонамент обикновено ще се появи, когато за първи
   път настройвате Вашия смарт телевизор или след като сте получи
   актуализация на софтуера на телевизора, която включва нашата Smart TV
   услуга.

   Би трябвало да можете да се откажете или да се абонирате за нашите
   Smart TV услуги по всяко време, когато Вашият телевизор е свързан с
   интернет. Обикновено можете да намерите нашата опция за отказване и
   включване в зоната на “настройки” на вашия Smart TV или в
   потребителския интерфейс на интерактивните телевизионни услуги. Ако
   имате проблем с намирането на тази функция, трябва да се свържете с
   производителя на телевизора, за да определите точното местоположение.
   Ако се откажете от нашите Smart TV услуги, ние няма повече да събираме
   зрителска информация чрез тази услуга. Въпреки това, ние може все пак
   да получаваме информация за съдържанието, което гледате, както е
   описано по-горе в раздела “Събиране на информация”, когато гледате
   съдържание чрез определени Smart TV приложения.

   Освен това, ако се откажете от услугите си за Smart TV, няма да можете
   да се възползвате от нашите интерактивни функции на вашия Smart TV; или
   функциите на други приложения, които разчитат на Smart TV Услугите, за
   да работят (след като сте разрешили използването им), например
   получаване на препоръки за съдържание въз основа на любимите ви
   предавания, взаимодействие или възпроизвеждане на любимите ви
   предавания чрез дистанционното или мобилното устройство на телевизора,
   достъп до ексклузивно съдържание и оферти, възможност да продължите да
   гледате шоуто, откъдето сте спрели, и получаване на известия, когато
   шоуто, което гледате, се връща след рекламите.

   Можете също така да изберете да активирате ограничението на
   проследяване на рекламите от менюто за “Поверителност” на
   интерактивните настройки на вашия Smart TV. Ако го направите, нашата
   рекламна платформа ще отпише Вашия Samba TV рекламен идентификатор и
   няма да получавате целеви реклами въз основа на информация от
   зрителското съдържание от Smart TV Услугите, независимо от това кое
   устройство използвате. Имайте предвид, че когато искате да прекратите
   връзката с данните, свързани с Вашия Samba TV рекламен идентификатор,
   можете просто да го нулирате. Моля, свършете се с производителя на
   телевизора за точното местоположение на тези функции. Ако не можете да
   ги намерите или производителят на телевизора ви не ги е активирал,
   моля, свържете се с нас на адрес privacy-support@samba.tv.

   Ако възнамерявате да продадете или по друг начин да подарите своя Smart
   TV, трябва да извършите “фабрично нулиране”. Това ще 1) нулира
   рекламния идентификатор Samba TV и 2) ще позволи на новия собственик на
   телевизора да избере дали желае да се включи или да се откаже. Ако
   продавате или подарявате вашия Smart TV без да извършите “фабрично
   нулиране”, информацията за новия собственик може да бъде неправилно
   приписана на вас.

Уеб и мобилни приложения

   Samba TV е активен член на инициативата за мрежова реклама (“NAI”),
   асоциация на индустрията, която разработва политиката за онлайн
   поверителност на потребителите в контекста на рекламиране в зависимост
   от интересите. Samba TV спазва Кодекса за поведение на NAI. В
   съответствие с нашия ангажимент към принципите на NAI ние Ви
   осигуряваме средства за отказване от рекламите според интересите ви
   базирани на използваните от вас уеб браузъри и мобилни приложения:
     * Уеб браузъри: Можете да се откажете от това Samba да използва
       информацията ви за сърфирането ви с мрежата с цел реклами базирани
       на интересите ви като посетите:
       http://optout.networkadvertising.org или като отидете на “Отмяна на
       Samba TV реклами” на адрес https://samba.tv/legal/privacy-policy/.
     * Мобилни устройства: За най-ефективните и нови методи, които
       ограничават следенето на реклами на Вашето мобилно устройство,
       моля, вижте настройките на мобилното ви устройство, за да разберете
       как можете да се откажете от получаването на реклами базирани на
       интересите ви, или да нулирате идентификациония номер за реклами на
       мобилното ви устройство, за да прекратите информацията, асоциирана
       с Вашия рекламен номер.

   Можете да научите повече за рекламирането въз основа на интереси, както
   и за съответните рамки за саморегулиране – и за компании като Samba TV,
   които се стремят да използват такива режими – като посетите NAI
   (https://www.networkadvertising.org) или Алианса за цифрова реклама
   (http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org).

Бисквитки и локална памет

   Ако предпочитате, обикновено може да изберете и настроите браузъра ви
   да премахва и отхвърля бисквитките на браузъра или да изчиства
   локалната памет. Моля, обърнете внимание, че ако изберете да премахнете
   или отхвърлите бисквитки или да изчистите локалната памет, това би
   повлияло върху наличността и функционалността на нашите услуги.

Информация за местоположението

   Може да включвате и изключвате услуги, базирани на местоположението,
   като коригирате настройките на мобилното си устройство.

Информация за профила и запитвания

   В съответствие с приложимото право може да имате право на достъп,
   актуализиране или изтриване на лични данни, които държим за вас,
   включително изтриване на информация за преглежданото съдържание. Това
   означава, че може да имате правото 1) да бъдете информирани за личната
   информация, която събираме, как я използваме, каква лична информация,
   сме споделили с трети страни, и да получите копие от тази информация; и
   2) да направите промени или да изтриете информацията, ако не е точна
   или е обработена в нарушение на приложимите закони. Можете да упражните
   тези права като влезете във Вашия онлайн профил в продуктите и услугите
   на Samba TV, които ползвате. В противен случай, моля, изпратете писмено
   искане, като използвате данните, посочени в раздела “Свържете се с нас”
   по-долу.

   Освен това, ако сте от определени територии, може да имате право да
   упражните допълнителни права, достъпни за вас съгласно приложимите
   закони, включително по-широки права на достъп и изтриване на личната ви
   информация, правото да оспорите или ограничите обработването на личните
   ви данни, или правото на преносимост на данни при определени
   обстоятелства. Ако искате да направите такова искане, моля свържете се
   с нас на адрес privacy@samba.tv или на долупосочения адреса в раздел
   “Свържете се с нас”.

   Ще разгледаме всички искания в съответствие с приложимите закони. За да
   получим достъп до личната ви информация, може да поискаме да
   предоставите допълнителна информация, за да потвърдим идентичността ви.
   Тази потвърждаваща информация ще бъде използвана само за да обработим
   Вашата молба. За да коригираме всяка информация, която имаме за Вас,
   моля, изпратете заявка за корекция, като следвате същите инструкции
   както по-горе.

   Не забравяйте, че в някои юрисдикции също имате правото да подадете
   жалба до органите за защита на данните (“DPA”) относно личната ви
   информация, която събираме и използваме. За повече информация, моля,
   свържете се с местния орган за защита на данните.

Съхраняване на информация

   Обикновено ще запазим личната ви информация толкова дълго, колкото е
   необходимо, за да изпълним целите, описани в тази Декларация за
   поверителност. Въпреки това, може да запазим определена информация,
   както се изисква от приложимото право (например данъчни, счетоводни или
   други правни изисквания) или за законни бизнес цели. Когато нямаме
   основание да продължим да обработваме личната ви информация, ние или ще
   я изтрием или ще я направим анонимна в съответствие с приложимите
   закони (въпреки че може да се наложи да запазим кеширани или архивирани
   копия за определен период от време, докато бъде възможно изтриването).

   Можем да съхраняваме Информация за зрителското поведение, толкова
   дълго, колкото е вашето взаимоотношение с нашия Интерактивен
   телевизионен софтуер. Информация за гледаното съдържание може да бъде
   съхранявана до десет (10) години от момента, в който нашите услуги
   достигнат до конкретно устройство, освен ако не ни помолите да изтрием
   тази информация, като следвате инструкциите по-горе.

Промоционални съобщения

   От време на време можем да ви изпращаме маркетингови съобщения за
   нашите продукти и услуги в съответствие с вашите предпочитания. Можете
   да се откажете да получавате промоционални съобщения от нас по всяко
   време, като следвате инструкциите в тези съобщения (често това ще бъде
   известие или линк в края на съобщението). Ако се откажете, ние все пак
   можем да Ви изпращаме непромоционални съобщения, като например такива
   относно Вашия профил или текущите ни бизнес съобщения.

Мобилни Известия

   С Ваше съгласие ние можем да изпращаме промоционални и непромоционални
   насочени известия или предупреждения на Вашето мобилно устройство. Може
   да деактивирате тези съобщения по всяко време като смените настройките
   за известия на мобилното си устройство.

Оттегляне на съгласието

   Когато разчитаме на вашето съгласие, за да обработваме личната ви
   информация, Вие имате право да оттеглите съгласието си по всяко време.

Правно основание за обработката (ЕИП)

   Ако сте физическо лице от ЕИП, нашето правно основание за събиране и
   използване на личната ви информация ще зависи от съответната лична
   информация и конкретния контекст, в който я събираме. Въпреки това, ние
   обикновено събираме лична информация само от вас, когато: 1) имаме
   съгласието ви за това, 2) когато имаме нужда от лична информация, за да
   сключим договор с вас (като ви предоставяме Услуги) или 3) когато
   обработката е в нашите или на трета страна законни интереси и не е
   отменена от интересите Ви за защита на данните или от основните права и
   свободи. В някои случаи можем също да имаме и юридическо задължение да
   събираме лична информация от Вас или в противен случай може да се
   нуждаем от личната информация, за да защитим вашите жизнени интереси
   или тези на друго лице.

   Когато разчитаме на вашето съгласие, за да обработваме личната
   информация, Вие имате право да оттеглите или отхвърлите съгласието си
   по всяко време. Моля, обърнете внимание, че това не засяга
   законосъобразността на обработката въз основа на съгласие преди да бъде
   оттеглено.

   Ако ви помолим да предоставите лична информация, за да спазим
   законовото изискване или да сключим договор с вас, ще изясним това към
   съответния момент и ще Ви уведомим дали предоставянето на личната ви
   информация е задължително или не (както и за възможните последствия,
   ако не я предоставите). Също така, ако събираме и използваме личната ви
   информация, разчитайки на законните ни интереси (или на трета страна),
   които не са описани все още в тези правила, ще Ви уведомим в подходящия
   момент какви са тези законни интереси.

   Ако имате някакви въпроси или се нуждаете от допълнителна информация
   относно правното основание, на което събираме и използваме вашата лична
   информация, моля свържете се с нас на privacy@samba.tv или на
   долупосочения адреса в раздел “Свържете се с нас”.
