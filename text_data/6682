   not about strict dietary limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or
   depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, itôs about feeling
   great, having more energy, and stabilizing your mood. If you feel
   overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition and diet advice out there,
   youôre not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a certain
   food is good for you, youôll find another saying exactly the opposite.
   But by using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and
   learn how to create a tasty, varied, and healthy diet.</p> <h3>Some of
