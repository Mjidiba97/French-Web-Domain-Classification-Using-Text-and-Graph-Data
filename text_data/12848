About

   OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer
   vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to
   provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to
   accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
   Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to
   utilize and modify the code.

   The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a
   comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision
   and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect
   and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in
   videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models
   of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images
   together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find
   similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images
   taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and
   establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc. OpenCV has
   more than 47 thousand people of user community and estimated number of
   downloads exceeding 18 million. The library is used extensively in
   companies, research groups and by governmental bodies.

   Along with well-established companies like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft,
   Intel, IBM, Sony, Honda, Toyota that employ the library, there are many
   startups such as Applied Minds, VideoSurf, and Zeitera, that make
   extensive use of OpenCV. OpenCV’s deployed uses span the range from
   stitching streetview images together, detecting intrusions in
   surveillance video in Israel, monitoring mine equipment in China,
   helping robots navigate and pick up objects at Willow Garage, detection
   of swimming pool drowning accidents in Europe, running interactive art
   in Spain and New York, checking runways for debris in Turkey,
   inspecting labels on products in factories around the world on to rapid
   face detection in Japan.

   It has C++, Python, Java and MATLAB interfaces and supports Windows,
   Linux, Android and Mac OS. OpenCV leans mostly towards real-time vision
   applications and takes advantage of MMX and SSE instructions when
   available. A full-featured CUDAand OpenCL interfaces are being actively
   developed right now. There are over 500 algorithms and about 10 times
   as many functions that compose or support those algorithms. OpenCV is
   written natively in C++ and has a templated interface that works
   seamlessly with STL containers.

Support

When something fails

   If you are attempting to debug an OpenCV program:
     * At first try to troubleshoot the problem
       using documentation and tutorials.
     * If it doesn’t help, search for an answer or ask a question
       at OpenCV Answers.
     * If you found a bug or wish to make a feature request, please see
       the next section.

Reporting issues / requesting features

     * First, check the issue tracker: known bugs, often with patches or
       workarounds, are generally found there. If you have something to
       add to an existing bug, add it as a comment to the ticket, rather
       than posting to the mailing lists.
     * Then check the OpenCV Answers to see if someone else has asked your
       question or reported your bug.
     * If all the above steps failed, the best thing to do is to raise
       a ticket.

   If you’re not sure what you found is a bug you can ask on OpenCV
   Answers. If the problem is confirmed as a bug, please create a ticket.

Asking a question

   Please read before posting to any of OpenCV support forums/lists!

Do Not:

     * The following are not appropriate questions:
          + general debugging/programming questions
          + questions about software that is not related to OpenCV
          + asking for help with your homework
     * Do not contact the developers/maintainers directly:
          + the community can’t see question or answer(s) not
            asked/answered publicly
          + open source development works best when the entire community
            participates in discussions and helps to answer questions

Do:

     * Be as specific as possible, with steps to reproduce. If we can
       reproduce the problem, we can fix it quickly.
     * Send all questions to OpenCV Answers or other corresponding mailing
       list, and report all bugs to the bug tracker.
     * Please specify your platform (Windows 32/64bit, Linux
       x86/x64/ppc/…, MacOSX 32/64bit/ppc); compiler version; OpenCV
       version/revision; whether IPP, OpenMP, MMX, SSE … have been enabled
       or not, and any other information that let us reproduce the
       environment, identify and localize the problem.
     * A sample code reproducing the problem helps us the most. Please
       check samples – for the preferred style (small code size,
       cross-platform). There is no need to provide any project files or
       makefiles, if it is a short single-file sample, we could build it
       and run in a minute.
     * Please provide the output of cv::getBuildInformation() function
       every time you report a bug about the trunk version of OpenCV. The
       problem can be in your build settings, so the log can greatly help
       us.
     * If your application is complex, and the problem happens somewhere
       in the middle, often it is still possible to create a short
       standalone sample:
          + capture and store the data that you pass to the function
            using FileStorage
          + copy the function call and put the corresponding reading
            from FileStorage in front of it
     * Describe exactly what you were doing or are trying to do and what
       went wrong. If you say: “OpenCV doesn’t work!” – we will not be
       able to help you.
     * As appropriate, also include your:
          + backtraces
          + relevant config files
          + screenshots or videos to demonstrate the problem

Contribute

   If you want to help us, there are many ways to do it. By the way, did
   you see the “Donate” button on the main page? 🙂

   Already have some code that you want to see as a part of the library?
   Please follow this guide.

Users can:

     * Help others, fill out some answers on our Q&A forum. You don’t have
       to be a guru to help.
     * Write cool tutorials: please follow the instructions.
     * Submit cool demo videos to our YouTube channel.
     * Say “thanks” with ratings and comments.

Developers can:

     * Participate in discussions regarding new code submissions. We have
       a lot of pull requests, and we need more people to review and test
       them! Actually you may become an official reviewer in the OpenCV
       project one day.
     * If you need a simple task to start from, please consider these
       ones. They are simple enough, so you can get familiar with
       the contribution process.
     * Contribute code: it has to be BSD and should not add extra
       dependencies. More information about a code submission is available
       on our developer site: contribution guide and coding style guide.
     * Test our latest code from the Git repository and report/fix any
       bugs you find. Reporting bugs.
     * Help us optimize the bindings for different
       platforms/languages: CUDA, NEON, Python, Android or iOS.
     * Help us improve the unit tests, documentation, samples.

Company can:

     * Become a sponsor to help hire developers and organize events.
     * Contribute to the OpenCV library by providing coder time or by
       being part of development decisions.
     * Provide the infrastructure (testing farm, build farm, website).
