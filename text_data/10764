   concerning licensing, royalty, and compliance. The type of information
   that we collect about you depends upon your particular interaction with
   us, but may include your name, email address, mailing address, phone
   number, and any other information that you choose to submit to us.

   We also collect information about your use of our Sites through cookies
   and tracking applications such as Google Analytics (please see our
   section below entitled “Cookies and Other Tracking” for additional
   information). This is used to provide a better website experience.

Use of Your Information

   We use the information that we collect about you for the following
   purposes:
     * To provide our services and products to you, to respond to your
       inquiries, to communicate with you about your use of our services,
       and for other customer service purposes
     * To better understand how users access and use our Sites and
       services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis
     * To improve our Sites and our services

Sharing Your Information

   We may share your information with the persons/entities below for the
   following business process purposes. We will not share your personal
   information with non-affiliated third parties for their own marketing
   purposes and we do not sell your information.
     * Service Providers. We may disclose the information we collect from
       you to third party service providers, contractors or agents who
       perform functions on our behalf. For example, these providers may
       help us administer our Sites or perform transactional services.
     * Business Transfers. If we are acquired by or merged with another
       company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to
       another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may
       transfer the information we have collected from you to the
       acquiring company.
     * In Response to Legal Process. We also may disclose the information
       we collect from you to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding,
       court order or other legal process, such as in response to a
       subpoena.
     * To Protect Ourselves and Others. We also may disclose the
       information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to

       suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the
       safety of any person or violations of our Terms of Use or this
       Policy.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

   We use cookies and similar technologies to track user activity and
   collect Site data. We may combine this data with the personal
   information we have collected from you.

   Cookies. Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for
   recordkeeping and other purposes. We use “cookies” on our Sites to,
   among other things, better serve you with tailored information and
   facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Sites.
     * Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online
       session. They disappear from your computer when you close your
       browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow
       our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you
       are logged in to the Sites.
     * Persistent cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer
       after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We
       use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical
       information about user activity.
     * Third Party Cookies. We use third parties, such as Google
       analytics, to track and analyze movement throughout our Sites.

   Disabling Cookies for our public website. Most web browsers
   automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer you can edit your
   browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the
   toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer
   from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you
   receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to
   our public website who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept
   cookies will be able to browse the Sites. IMPORTANT TO NOTE that users
   of our HDMI Adopter Extranet website must enable cookies so that their
   unique Adopter login credentials can be validated and the site can keep
   users logged in and continue to conduct services.

Pixel Tags and Other Technologies

   We may sometimes use pixel tags on our Adopter extranet site, which are
   tiny graphics with a unique identifier similar in function to cookies
   to track the activities of website visitors, help us manage content,
   and compile statistics about website usage. We and our third party
   service providers may also track e-mails to our customers, to help us
   track e-mail response rates.

Third-Party Links

   At times, our Sites may contain links to third party websites. Any
   access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this
   Policy, but, instead, is governed by the privacy policies of those
   third party websites, and we are not responsible for the information
   practices of such third party websites.

User Generated Content

   Certain of our Sites contain our blogs and Twitter site. Any
   information that we post comes from public information and we may, for
   example, retweet or post on something we see.

How Secure Is Information About Me?

   We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions, including,
   where appropriate, password protection, encryption, and SSL to protect
   our Sites and the information we collect from loss, misuse, and
   unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. The
   companies and third parties we share information with in order to
   conduct our business processes and with whom we may share your user
   data are aware of our requirements for compliance. Please be aware that
   despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100%
   security all of the time.

   You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your
   password, computer, and web-enabled devices, among other things, by
   signing off after using a shared computer, inserting a password on your
   web-enabled device, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can
   easily guess, and keeping your password private. You should never share
   your log-in information with others. We are not responsible for any
   lost, stolen or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your
   account via unauthorized password activity.

Can I Access and Modify My Personal Information?

   If you submitted your information on our Sites, you may update your
   information by emailing admin@hdmi.org. Please note that copies of
   information that you have updated, modified or deleted may continue to
   reside in our systems for a period of time.

What Choices Do I Have?

   From time to time, we may send you informational emails, primarily
   related to HDMI Adopter-only information including important updates.
   If, at any time, you would like to stop receiving these emails, please
   follow the opt-out instructions contained in any such e-mail. Please
   note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out
   requests, and that your opt-out pertains only to the receipt of
   marketing and advertising promotions and not for issues related to your
   service.

Terms of Use

   Your use of our Sites, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this
   Policy and our Terms of Use (available on this website) including
   applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes.

Consent to Transfer Information to the United States

   If you are located outside of the United States, please note that
   information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the
   United States. By using our Sites and services, you consent to the
   transfer and processing of your information in the United States, which
   in some cases may not have data protection laws that provide the same
   level or types of protection that exists in other countries. Your
   consent is voluntary. If, however, you do not consent, then we may not
   be able to provide you with our Services.

Children Under 13

   Our Site is not designed for persons under 13.

Changes to this Policy

   We may change this Policy from time to time. We will post any changes
   to our policy to our Sites. If we make any changes to this Policy that
   materially affect our practices with regard to the personal information
   we have previously collected from you, we will endeavor to provide you
   with notice in advance of such change, by highlighting the change on
   the Sites or by sending an email to you at the email address that you
   have registered with us.
