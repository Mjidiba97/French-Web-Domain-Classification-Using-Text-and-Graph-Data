   Highlights of the Neustar Privacy Policy

   Updated: February 28, 2019

   Neustar uses personal information to support data-driven
   decision-making and deliver personalized content without sacrificing
   personal privacy. These "Highlights" summarize Neustar's privacy
   practices. You can learn more by clicking on the links below, and by
   reviewing the Neustar Privacy Statement and Privacy Principles.

Our Commitment – Privacy by Design

   We follow the Neustar Privacy Principles, including the principles of
   Privacy by Design, to design, build, and deliver products and services
   that respect your privacy.

Personal Information: Types & Sources

   Neustar may collect, use, and disclose various types of information,
   including:
     * PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
     * CRM Data (Customer Relationship Management data)
     * Pseudonymous IDs including information linked to DIIs (Device
       Identifiable Data) such as Cookies, MAID (Mobile Advertising IDs),
       Statistical IDs, IP Addresses and other third-party identifiers
       that do not, by themselves, identify a specific individual.
     * Attribute Data
     * Geolocation or Latitude/Longitude data that are or are rendered
       imprecise
     * Log Data, including Internet Log Data, Event Data, and Service Data

   Neustar collects this information from a wide variety of sources, both
   on and offline, such as:
     * Publicly available data sources such as directory listings
     * Reputable providers of licensed data derived from public and
       non-public sources
     * Individuals, such as survey respondents, who affirmatively agree to
       the data uses
     * Our customers, who provide their CRM Data for our use in connection
       with our services
     * Information collected online via Pseudonymous IDs, including DIIs,
       Cookies, Mobile Advertising IDs or MAIDs, Statistical IDs, and
       other persistent third-party identifiers that do not, by
       themselves, identify a specific individual
     * Match Partners, Coverage Partners, Rotators, and Cookie Sync
       Partners
     * Log Data and other information created in the course of providing
       our products and services

Personal Information Collection, Use, and Disclosure

   Read our full Neustar Privacy Statement to learn more about the
   Personal Information we collect and how we use it:
     * Data collected about Website Visitors
     * Data Processed to Provide Neustar Products and Services
     * Other Use and Disclosure of Personal Information

Cookies, Advertising IDs and Other Technologies

   We may use Cookies, Mobile Advertising IDs or MAIDs, Statistical IDs,
   Web Beacons, Pixel Tags, JavaScript, HTML5 Local Storage, or similar
   technologies, along with other information described in our Privacy
   Statement to enhance and personalize your experience on our sites and
   to manage and enable preferences, transactions and related uses of
   Neustar services and information. These technologies do not identify
   you to us unless you have voluntarily identified yourself on our
   websites. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting
   cookies, you will receive a warning message with each cookie. You can
   refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser, but some of the
   features on our site may not work if you do. Various browsers may offer
   their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage.

Transparency and Choice; Privacy Choices

Cookies

     * Click here to opt out of the use of Cookies on Neustar websites
     * You can opt out of Neustar services Cookies by clicking on the
       Neustar Choice Portal link in the Privacy Choices page on our
       website. This will also permit you to opt-out of the use of Hashed
       eMail Addresses and Android Mobile Advertising IDs.
     * You can also opt out of the use of Neustar services Cookies by
       using the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Consumer Opt-Out
       tool, the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) tool here, or the
       European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Opt-Out tool.

Mobile Advertising IDs or MAIDs

   You can opt-out of our use of Mobile Advertising IDs or MAIDs set by
   Android devices via the Neustar Choice Portal link in the Privacy
   Choices page on our website. Because Apple does not disclose their IDFA
   to users, we are not able to establish a block based on an Apple MAID
   (IDFA) in our system. In addition:
     * Apple's iOS IDFA can be reset by the user at any time. Users can
       opt out of all remarketing by enabling a device setting called
       "Limit Ad Tracking" (LAT), which restricts advertisers from using
       the IDFA for behavioral advertising. You can learn how to limit ad
       tracking on your iOS device or to reset your IDFA here: IDFA
       Opt-Out.
     * Similar to IDFA for Apple devices, Android devices pass the Google
       Advertising ID, which provides the same type of device-specific,
       unique, resettable ID for advertising as Apple IDFA or IFA. You can
       learn more about how identifiers on mobile devices are used for
       advertising and receive instruction for how to opt out of mobile
       advertising on the Google Privacy & Terms webpage.

Hashed eMail Addresses

   You can opt-out of our use of your Hashed Email Addresses in connection
   with Neustar services by clicking on the Neustar Choice Portal link in
   the Privacy Choices page on our website. We will retain your email
   address on an internal "block" list to prevent its further use in
   connection with Neustar services. Please note that opting out of
   Neustar's processing of your data does not mean you will block online
   advertising altogether or see fewer ads. It simply means that the ads
   that you see will not be personalized for you. Ads may be served
   because they relate to the website you are visiting or to your current
   search, or they may just be randomly placed.

   Your choice to use any of our opt-out tools will not affect ads placed
   by any other organization.

Accountability

   Neustar is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and
   the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") and adheres to each
   organization's Codes and Principles. You can also learn more about
   online advertising in general on the NAI website, which provides
   background information on participating companies and permits you to
   opt-out of receiving tailored online advertising from some or all of
   its members. For information about the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for
   Online Behavioral Advertising and to learn more about the Ad Choices
   icon, visit http://www.aboutads.info/ and http://youradchoices.com/.

   We adhere to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance's
   ("EDAA") principles. You may learn more about our participation in the
   EDAA's program and online behavioral advertising at
   www.youronlinechoices.eu.

   advertising at: www.youronlinechoices.eu
