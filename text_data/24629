Q&A on the Book Continuous Delivery in Java
       The book Continuous Delivery in Java by Daniel Bryant and Abraham
       Marin-Perez was released nearly ten years after the original
       Continuous Delivery book by Dave Farley and Jez Humble, and more
       than 20 years after Java‚Äôs first release. Q&A with the authors to
       better understand from their experience why a book on Continuous
       Delivery specifically for Java and the JVM ecosystem was needed.

DDD & Microservices -> Do neg√≥cio √† arquitetura
       O DDD √© um conjunto de princ√≠pios de constru√ß√£o de software baseado
       no profundo entendimento do neg√≥cio. Naturalmente, uma das √°reas
       impactadas por esses princ√≠pios √© a arquitetura. Em se tratando de
       Microsservi√ßos, √© ainda mais importante que a constru√ß√£o e
       organiza√ß√£o dos servi√ßos esteja alinhada com o neg√≥cio, para que se
       tenha o maior ganho de performance e efici√™ncia na manuten√ß√£o.

Sendo um engenheiro de software √©tico
       Nossa vida tem melhorado por conta da tecnologia. A engenharia de
       software √© umas das pr√°ticas mais influenciadoras que temos nos
       dias atuais e que est√° moldando a sociedade que conhecemos, mas ao
       que parece a ind√∫stria ainda n√£o compartilha dessa responsabilidade
       social. No fim das contas, n√£o se trata de sermos melhores
       desenvolvedores, mas sim de sermos pessoas melhores.

Desenvolvimento orientado pela observabilidade
       Como o desenvolvimento orientado por observabilidade difere do
       monitoramento? √Ä medida que os sistemas distribu√≠dos se tornam cada
       vez mais complicados e os silos se degradam para testes, automa√ß√£o
       e efici√™ncia de DevOps, a ODD surge como um superconjunto de
       monitoramento para compreender as inc√≥gnitas desconhecidas do seu
       c√≥digo.

Q&A on the Book Continuous Delivery in Java
       The book Continuous Delivery in Java by Daniel Bryant and Abraham
       Marin-Perez was released nearly ten years after the original

       better understand from their experience why a book on Continuous
       Delivery specifically for Java and the JVM ecosystem was needed.

Construindo um pipeline CI/CD + Liquibase no GitLab
       Neste artigo veremos como construir um pipeline CI/CD utilizando o
       GitLab-CI para realizar a parte de compila√ß√£o, testes unit√°rios,
       empacotamento e deploy de uma aplica√ß√£o Java utilizando Maven no
       servidor de aplica√ß√£o WildFly. Por fim, o gerenciamento de mudan√ßa
       do banco de dados atrav√©s da ferramenta Liquibase ser√° autom√°tico.

DDD & Microservices -> Do neg√≥cio √† arquitetura
       O DDD √© um conjunto de princ√≠pios de constru√ß√£o de software baseado
       no profundo entendimento do neg√≥cio. Naturalmente, uma das √°reas
       impactadas por esses princ√≠pios √© a arquitetura. Em se tratando de
       Microsservi√ßos, √© ainda mais importante que a constru√ß√£o e
       organiza√ß√£o dos servi√ßos esteja alinhada com o neg√≥cio, para que se
       tenha o maior ganho de performance e efici√™ncia na manuten√ß√£o.

Sendo um engenheiro de software √©tico
       Nossa vida tem melhorado por conta da tecnologia. A engenharia de
       software √© umas das pr√°ticas mais influenciadoras que temos nos
       dias atuais e que est√° moldando a sociedade que conhecemos, mas ao
       que parece a ind√∫stria ainda n√£o compartilha dessa responsabilidade
       social. No fim das contas, n√£o se trata de sermos melhores
       desenvolvedores, mas sim de sermos pessoas melhores.

Desenvolvimento orientado pela observabilidade
       Como o desenvolvimento orientado por observabilidade difere do
       monitoramento? √Ä medida que os sistemas distribu√≠dos se tornam cada
       vez mais complicados e os silos se degradam para testes, automa√ß√£o
       e efici√™ncia de DevOps, a ODD surge como um superconjunto de
       monitoramento para compreender as inc√≥gnitas desconhecidas do seu
       c√≥digo.

Book Review: A Leader's Guide to Cybersecurity
       A Leader's Guide to Cybersecurity educates readers about how to
       prevent a crisis and/or take leadership when one occurs. With a
       focus on clear communication, the book provides details, examples,
       and guidance of mapping security against what a business actually
       does. The book describes ways to align security with the motivation
       of others who may be security-agnostic against their own goals.

13 Practices for Better Code Reviews
       When done incorrectly, code review can be irritating, excessively
       time consuming, and have little or no impact on code quality.
       However, if done well, it can improve the quality of code and
       reduce the overall time spent delivering features. This article
       provides several good practices regarding both technical and
       cultural aspects of code review.
