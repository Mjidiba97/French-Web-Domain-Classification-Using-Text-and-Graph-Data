DATA COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENTS

Eulerian Software Solutions

   Eulerian is a leading provider of software solutions for the
   collection, synchronization and/or analysis of navigation data and
   personal data to create statistical charts for marketing performance.
   Please refer to the exhibit listing the websites on which our clients
   use our software solutions.

   Our clients use our software solutions to better understand the
   behavior and expectations of web users in order to improve interaction
   on their sites and improve the quality of the content and services that
   they offer.

Cookies used

   When used by our clients, our software solutions rely on a first-party
   client cookie (a cookie under the client’s domain name) to collect
   information about your browsing on client sites, including the
   following information: the device used (computer, mobile, tablet,
   etc.), the browser used, interaction with advertising elements, the
   time spent on the site or actions taken, including pages visited,
   products viewed, registration for a service, the creation of a basket
   or submission of a registration form.

   Data collected via clients’ cookies and transferred to Eulerian. This
   collect is used to establish statistical reports on use of our clients’
   services to customize the display of certain pages on their website(s),
   or to distribute targeted advertising materials.

   Data collected through these client cookies contain the aforementioned
   navigation data and pseudonymized data that is (i) the IP address,
   shortened to the last few bytes, which is collected solely for the
   purposes of geographically locating the web user, the geographical
   location being no more specific than the city or town of connection,
   and (ii) a unique identifier attributed to the device used to connect
   to the client website(s).

   In some cases, our clients share the CRM identifiers of their visitors
   so that we can reconcile, on behalf of our clients, the data generated
   by a single web user on different devices, for the purpose of
   establishing his or her cross-device navigational behavior.

   Finally, Eulerian’ solutions are by no means e-mail routers and do not
   send newsletters or e-mailings to internet subscribers of its clients.
   If cookies from Eulerian can be implemented on computers of users of
   these items, they remain the sole responsibility of our clients.

Data collected by our clients’ partners

   Eulerian may also receive data (including personal data) collected by
   our clients’ partners and synchronized, at the request of our clients,
   with our clients’ data for the purposes of analyzing and drawing up
   statistical reports.

   Eulerian acts as a data processor, on the instructions of its clients.
   Our software solutions incorporate a technical connector, made
   available to the client, enabling the information collected by the
   clients’ partner to be sent to Eulerian. This partner data is stored
   and synchronized with the client’s data and analyzed using Eulerian
   software solutions to draw up statistical reports on behalf of and to
   be sent to the client.

Web user information

   As data processor, we are contractually bound to our clients and we ask
   them to commit to inform the users of their website(s) and/or the users
   of their partner’s site(s) that processing is carried out on their
   behalf using Eulerian software solutions.

Data ownership

   The data collected and processed via our software solutions remain the
   property of our clients, which are data controllers, at all times.
   Eulerian acts only as a data processor for its clients according to the
   instructions of its clients.

   You are informed that the processing of data for our clients is in no
   event pooled and/or consolidated with the other clients of Eulerian,
   nor is it used on behalf of Eulerian.

   With the consent of our clients we reserve the right to publish
   aggregated data concerning all of the sites using Eulerian solutions.
   This aggregated data forms part of global statistics used to promote
   our solutions but does not contain any personal data or business
   information.

Your rights

   Your right to access, modify, object to and delete data collected on
   behalf of our clients or to restrict the processing thereof should
   therefore be exercised directly by contacting our clients using the
   contact details on their website(s). The contract that binds us to our
   clients contains an undertaking that the clients will supply the users
   of their website(s) with suitable means of exercising these rights.

Contact

   If you would like more information about the data protection charter of
   Eulerian, contact our data protection officer by
   email: dpo@eulerian.com
