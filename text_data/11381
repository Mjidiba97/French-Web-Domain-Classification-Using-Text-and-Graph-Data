The one with a day in Groningen

   A while ago, I visited Groningen with my mom. It's quite the commute by
   train, but it was definitely worth it. Our destination was the
   Groninger Museum. The reason we went was the David LaChapelle
   exhibition. David LaChapelle is a photographer, and music video and
   film director. He has done commercial work for magazines like Rolling
   Stone, Vanity Fair and Vogue. His work has been described as 'surreal
   pop kitsch'. And you may have seen some of his music videos for Britney
   Spears, Jennifer Lopez, No Doubt and Amy Winehouse. My favourite video
   is Take me to Church by Hozier.

   The inside of the museum is filled with gorgeous works of art, but the
   outside of the museum is spectacular too!

   We took a stroll around the city and spotted some cool streetart and
   doors!

   gorgeous!

The one at Afrika Museum

   Some weeks ago I visited Afrika Museum with my mom. We went for the
   Photo Exhibition 'Afrotopia'. This exhibit was previously shown at the
   eleventh edition of the African Photography Biennial in Bamako (Mali),
   and it's for the first time that it's shown outside of Bamako. Works of
   forrty contemporary African photographers were chosen and show new
   insights of the past, shines light on the present and offers new
   perspectives for the future.

   [20180717_134617.jpg]
   As a photography-enthousiast, this was right up my alley, I loved the
   diversity of the works shown. We will even try to squeeze in another
   visit before the exhibition ends the beginning of september! If you're
   able to go, I can highly recommend a visit. If not, the photos below
   and this very short video give an impression of what can be seen. A
   previous post about the same museum can be found here.

   The museum also offers an outdoor area, where traditional African
   villages and compounds can be seen.

The one with the greens

   Last saturday was my day off, and I needed to get some things done on
   the other side of our City's centre. I decided to take the scenic route
   through the park back home, and was amazed by how stunning it looks at
   this time of the year. Below I am sharing some of the photos taken
   (with my phone, no filters added), hope they bring you some joy on this
   monday!

The one with some of my Etsy favourites

   Lately I've been having some mixed feelings about Etsy, clearly things
   have changed. As a shop-owner: changed lay out, decreasing views and
   sales, and for me the whole community part of the website seems to have
   disappeared. But also as a shopper: the lay out of the frontpage (which
   often gave me cool suggestions of things I didn't know I was looking
   for), but also more and more sellers that clearly sell items that
   aren't made by them, are not antique, or aren't craft supplies. I come
   across the same stuff that is also being offered at websites as
   AliExpress, but also shopowners that claim to sell handmade, but are
   items that I also sell in my brick and mortar shop, that are made by
   another person. Well, with that being said, there still are makers that
   design and/or make their own items. These are some of the things that
   stood out for me the last couple of weeks. Are you a buyer or seller on
   Etsy? Any shops I should know about?
