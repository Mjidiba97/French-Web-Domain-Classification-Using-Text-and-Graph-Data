What is the legal basis for processing your personal data?

   We will normally process personal data from you only where:
     * we need the personal data to carry out a contract with you;
     * we have obtained your consent to the processing of your personal
       data; or
     * the processing is in our legitimate interests (and not outweighed
       by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and
       freedoms).

How long is personal data kept?

   We will retain your personal data:
     * for as long as you keep your profile on my.euroclear.com; or
     * until you request us to remove your personal data from our
       marketing database (e.g. to honour opt-outs); or
     * as long as necessary to perform our contractual engagements with
       you

   Personal data collected for conference advertisement or for conference
   registration is retained for the duration of the relevant event or
   longer if the event repeats (e.g. annually).

   In addition, we may retain personal data from closed accounts to comply
   with national laws, prevent fraud, collect any amounts owed, resolve
   disputes, assist with governmental investigation or take any actions
   permitted or required by applicable national laws.

Who might Euroclear share your personal data with?

     * We transfer your personal data within the Euroclear group for
       purposes consistent with this Privacy Notice. We take measures to
       restrict access to staff who have a legitimate business need to see
       your data.
     * Euroclear may also provide your personal data to public bodies such
       as regulatory, government agency, court or other third parties such
       as but not limited to, the Police Authorities, the Financial
       Supervisory Authorities and the Tax Agencies, where we believe
       disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or
       regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights,
       or (iii) to protect your interests or those of any other person.
     * We also disclose your personal data to our third party vendors,
       service providers and partners who provide data processing services
       to us. This may be in connection with the services they provide to
       us, including to support us in areas such as IT platform management
       or support services, infrastructure and application services,
       marketing, data analytics. These service providers may change over
       time, but our commitment to using trusted vendors will not. We will
       always work with third parties who will handle your personal data
       in a way that aligns with this Notice and the GDPR. We have further
       inserted adequate contractual clauses with these third parties to
       ensure that your personal data remains protected. Further
       information can be provided upon request.
     * We also disclose your personal data with our auditors, advisors,
       legal representatives and similar agents in connection with the
       advisory services they provide to us for legitimate business
       purposes and under contractual prohibition of using the personal
       data for any other purpose.

International data transfers

   Our group companies and third party contractors and consultants operate
   around the world. This means that we may process personal data outside
   the European Economic area (EEA). However, we have taken appropriate
   safeguards to require that your personal data will remain protected in
   accordance with this notice. These include implementing data protection
   clauses and EU Standard Contractual Clauses with our third party
   vendors, contractors and consultants as well as with our group
   entities.

   processing your personal data. If you wish to object please contact our
   Data Protection Officer.

   unsubscribe link in the marketing e-mails we send you or by using your
   profile on MyEuroclear.com to opt-out of our communities, newsletters
   and general interest areas. To opt-out of other forms of marketing
   (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), please contact our Data
   Protection Officer.

The right to complain to a supervisory authority

   Euroclear has not sufficiently addressed any concern of complaint. For
   more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

   appropriate measures and processes that are designed to provide a level
   of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data to

   number of security measures, including:
     * Secure operating environments - We store your data in secure
       operating environments and only accessible to Euroclear employees,
       agents and contractors on a need-to-know basis. Euroclear also

     * Encryption - We use industry-standard encryption to provide
       protection for information that is transmitted to us via the
       Websites.
     * Prior authentication for account access - We require our website
       users registered on my.euroclear.com to verify their identity (e.g.
       login ID and password) before they can access or make changes to
       their account. This is aimed to prevent unauthorised accesses.

Links to non-Euroclear sites

   The Euroclear website contains links to other websites. Euroclear is
   not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other
   websites.

What if you choose not to give us personal data?

   is necessary in order to:
     * enter a contract
     * supply services
     * provide you with further information on our services
     * assess your job application

   then we will not be able to enter into that contract or provide the
   requested services or information or consider you for a job.
