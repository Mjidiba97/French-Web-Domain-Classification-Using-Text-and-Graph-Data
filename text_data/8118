   Styling & Photography Challenge 6

   I was sleepily scrolling through my Facebook feed last week when a link
   from Happyolks caught my eye. One click, and I found myself nodding
   along as I read a very honest and thoughtful post on food photography.
   It was as though someone had taken a peek into my heart and felt the
   fatigue I was experiencing with my own photographs.

   Do you ever feel like you‚Äôre in a rut? As much as I have fun with the
   food I share with you, I have felt lately that I am on autopilot. While
   its good to have a system that works for me, and efficiency is
   certainly important, I needed to throw a wrench in it. To challenge
   myself to try something different.

   Enter this photograph:

   Photo Credit: Con Poulos

   Photographed by Con Poulos for Donna Hay‚Äôs cookbook, Seasons, this
   seemingly straightforward scene is the subject of this month‚Äôs Donna
   Hay Styling & Photography Challenge. Hosted by the wonderful Simone of
   Jungle Frog Cooking, the idea behind the challenge is to study and
   analyze the inspiring photographs taken by the talented photographers
   behind the scenes of Donna Hay‚Äôs cookbooks.

   I typically stay away from this aspect of food blogging ‚Äì there are so
   many fun challenges one can participate in: between cooking your way
   through Dorie Greenspan, being a Daring Baker, and wondering Does My
   Blog Look Good In This? ‚Äì there‚Äôs enough to keep one busy for years.
   But this one caught my eye. I respect Simone and her work. And while I
   certainly did not approach this challenge as one that would foster
   copying (or as I have called it, inbreeding) in food photography, I
   think the point is that it can be interesting to understand just what
   it took to capture these images that make us want to cook.

   Besides, I had the fresh bread. And the arugula. And the prosciutto.

   And I was hungry.

   The Bruschetta with Mozzarella, Prosciutto and Arugula Pesto was melt
   in your mouth delicious. It took minutes to prepare, and just a few
   minutes more to eat until my plate was empty. But photographing it?
   Much harder than it looks.

   The seemingly unfussy photo was a challenge to replicate. My excuses?
   My table is too dark. The light was dim from a passing rain storm. My
   props were different.

   But enough of my excuses.

   I love this shot, but it was way too close, in comparison to the
   original. There was something else wrong.

   When I first set up my shot, I was on autopilot, with my light source
   coming from 9 o‚Äôclock. The curve of the table and the chair in the
   background matched the original, but the lighting definitely was not.
   So, I had to flip things around.

   With the light coming from 3 o‚Äôclock, and the styling more stark, I
   stay as true as I can to Con Poulos‚Äô original. I can appreciate the
   clarity of the knife and the more subtle shadow on the left side of the
   plate, though I wish I could have a lighter mood to the photograph. But
   this does speak to the passing rain clouds that afternoon, and the
   darkness of at my kitchen table.

   In the end, my favorite shot was the one that matched the photograph‚Äôs
   lighting, but incorporated a little more interest in the background
   with the plate of pesto as well as more of the chair. But the biggest
   lesson for me was scaling back. Learning to work with minimal items in
   the shot. Working on balance.

   And when you think about it, that easily translates into good, simple
   cooking ‚Äî it‚Äôs an important reminder to keep things clean, without the
   fuss, and to focus on the few ingredients at hand. This bruschetta
   certainly represents that, and more.

Bruschetta with Mozzarella, Prosciutto and Arugula Pesto

   Bruschetta with Mozzarella, Prosciutto and Arugula Pesto Bruschetta
   with Mozzarella, Prosciutto and Arugula Pesto Print Recipe

Ingredients

   8 slices of bread
   1 clove garlic, halved
   extra virgin olive oil (to brush on bread)
   4 pieces mozzarella (it is equally tasty with goat cheese)
   8 slices prosciutto
   freshly ground black pepper

   FOR THE ARUGULA PESTO
   1 handful basil (or you can use all arugula)
   2 handfuls rocket arugula
   1/3 cup toasted pine nuts
   1/4 cup grated Parmesan
   1/2 garlic clove
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

Instructions

   Make the pesto by placing the basil, arugula, pine nuts, Parmesan and
   garlic in the bowl of a food processor and pulse so that it still
   chunky. With the motor running, add the olive oil. Try to make sure the
   pesto still has some body and is not thin.

   Brush both sides of bread lightly with olive oil. Toast the bread on a
   grill pan or in a toaster. Rub both sides with garlic clove. Spread
   pesto on top, and layer with cheese and prosciutto.

       Liren, your interpretation of the DH original is great. I think you
       captured all the critical elements of the photo. I actually like
       yours more. I am in love with DH photography and have been too
       intimidated to tackle the challenges. You made it look like a

       Wow Liren you are mastering this photography thing. I like your
       shot better, it made me hungrier. But then again you are speaking
       my food language. It‚Äôs good to try new things, I‚Äôm in a rut too,
       but moving isn‚Äôt helping things. Hope you have a great weekend.

       I completely agree with Cristina. I actually prefer Liren‚Äôs image ‚Äî
       so I guess I‚Äôd say this challenge was a major success. And, yes,
       I‚Äôm in a big rut right now and am pondering so many aspects of my
       work ‚Ä¶ and myself. Sometimes stepping away from everything for a
       while and seeing things from another perspective is all it takes to
       hit ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù. Gorgeous work, Liren!

       first time I heard about this challenge was last month on Kankana‚Äôs
       (Sunshine & Smile) blog.
       I browsed then through previous galleries and I was surprised to
       see some (most) of those that took the challenge had a better photo
       than the original.
       The original photo seems like dead nature, while other come to
       life, they make me crave them!
       Your photos are beautiful as ever Liren :)

       Hi Liren,
       Being on auto-pilot happens to us all. The only way out of it is as
       you did, to challenge ourselves. Your shots are fantastic. I agree
       with you about adding the pesto in the background it adds another
       great element to the photo. Thanks for sharing, the bruschetta
       looks fantastic!

       Liren, this is such a great post! It‚Äôs comforting to hear that even
       someone like you, whose photography I admire so much, still has
       days where you feel like you‚Äôre in a rut. I loved hearing about
       your process for these shots, and I think they turned out
       wonderfully!

       Liren, great shots! I saw Donna Hay challenge on Kankana‚Äôs site
       last month and I really admire people who try extra harder to
       improve their photography. I want to learn but I‚Äôve been too lazy
       and carried away with busy daily schedule. I think at some point I
       need to push myself. Beautiful photos. Delicious bruschetta too!

       Delicious, rustic flavors on this bruschetta, Liren. My kinda food
       for any time of the day. I think your version of the image‚Ä¶turned
       out much livelier and vibrant than the original (IMO :) ).
       Beautifully done and I like the contrast against the dark back.

       O yeah! You made it despite the webhosting troubles!! I too love
       this challenge as it makes me think outside the box and outside of
       my comfort zone. I tend to stick to what I know and the things I do
       best but that doesn‚Äôt help me grow or learn more and this challenge
       is just great in that respect. And you‚Äôve done a great job too,
       especially with the limited lighting you had since I do think the
       original has a bit brighter light coming in from the right. What I
       struggled with a lot of and I know most others did too was the
       perspective of the various elements. it drove me nuts!
       In the end I loved the dish and isn‚Äôt that all that matters.
       great job and hope to see you again next month! And we will have
       prizes to win then!

       Beautiful Liren! I sure am glad you were hungry and had all the
       ingredients on hand.
       I like the glass on the dark background behind the food, it kind of
       pulls the eye over the bruschetta and then back again for another
       look at that delicious plate of food;-)

       ‚Ä¶ will try next time ‚Ä¶ surprisingly more difficult than I thought ‚Ä¶
       I must admit I did not give enough time to this assignment ‚Ä¶ but
       again I did not expect it to be so challenging ‚Ä¶

       Wow Liren you are mastering this photography thing. I like your
       shot better, it made me hungrier. But then again you are speaking
       my food language. It‚Äôs good to try new things, I‚Äôm in a rut too,
       but moving isn‚Äôt helping things. Hope you have a great weekend.

       I completely agree with Cristina. I actually prefer Liren‚Äôs image ‚Äî
       so I guess I‚Äôd say this challenge was a major success. And, yes,
       I‚Äôm in a big rut right now and am pondering so many aspects of my
       work ‚Ä¶ and myself. Sometimes stepping away from everything for a
       while and seeing things from another perspective is all it takes to
       hit ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù. Gorgeous work, Liren!

       first time I heard about this challenge was last month on Kankana‚Äôs
       (Sunshine & Smile) blog.
       I browsed then through previous galleries and I was surprised to
       see some (most) of those that took the challenge had a better photo
       than the original.
       The original photo seems like dead nature, while other come to
       life, they make me crave them!
       Your photos are beautiful as ever Liren :)

       Hi Liren,
       Being on auto-pilot happens to us all. The only way out of it is as
       you did, to challenge ourselves. Your shots are fantastic. I agree
       with you about adding the pesto in the background it adds another
       great element to the photo. Thanks for sharing, the bruschetta
       looks fantastic!

       Liren, this is such a great post! It‚Äôs comforting to hear that even
       someone like you, whose photography I admire so much, still has
       days where you feel like you‚Äôre in a rut. I loved hearing about
       your process for these shots, and I think they turned out
       wonderfully!

       Liren, great shots! I saw Donna Hay challenge on Kankana‚Äôs site
       last month and I really admire people who try extra harder to
       improve their photography. I want to learn but I‚Äôve been too lazy
       and carried away with busy daily schedule. I think at some point I
       need to push myself. Beautiful photos. Delicious bruschetta too!

       Delicious, rustic flavors on this bruschetta, Liren. My kinda food
       for any time of the day. I think your version of the image‚Ä¶turned
       out much livelier and vibrant than the original (IMO :) ).
       Beautifully done and I like the contrast against the dark back.

       O yeah! You made it despite the webhosting troubles!! I too love
       this challenge as it makes me think outside the box and outside of
       my comfort zone. I tend to stick to what I know and the things I do
       best but that doesn‚Äôt help me grow or learn more and this challenge
       is just great in that respect. And you‚Äôve done a great job too,
       especially with the limited lighting you had since I do think the
       original has a bit brighter light coming in from the right. What I
       struggled with a lot of and I know most others did too was the
       perspective of the various elements. it drove me nuts!
       In the end I loved the dish and isn‚Äôt that all that matters.
       great job and hope to see you again next month! And we will have
       prizes to win then!

       Beautiful Liren! I sure am glad you were hungry and had all the
       ingredients on hand.
       I like the glass on the dark background behind the food, it kind of
       pulls the eye over the bruschetta and then back again for another
       look at that delicious plate of food;-)

   indeed four (4) tomatillos. You will note that in step 1, all the
   tomatillos are blended together after roasting. Then, in step 3, the
   soup as a whole is blended in batches. If you have an immersion (stick)
   blender, then you can just go ahead and blend it all together, but for
   standard blenders, I always recommend blending the hot soup in batches
   for safety. I hope that helps! <p>Hi Inger, it is indeed four (4)

   The recipe calls for 4 medium tomatillos, then blend in batches. Seems
   like 4 tomatillos could be blended in one batch.. Perhaps this recipe
   has a typo and it should be 4 pounds or 40 medium tomatillos? Thanks!

   I&#039;m so sorry to hear that, Sue. Did you use the same hummus?
   I&#039;m curious if it was a problem with the batter, or perhaps not
   baking long enough; ovens do vary in terms, in which case you may have
   had to adjust the baking time. <p>I&#8217;m so sorry to hear that, Sue.

   Bruschetta with Mozzarella, Prosciutto and Arugula Pesto | Donna Hay
   Styling & Photography Challenge 6

   I was sleepily scrolling through my Facebook feed last week when a link
   from Happyolks caught my eye. One click, and I found myself nodding
   along as I read a very honest and thoughtful post on food photography.
   It was as though someone had taken a peek into my heart and felt the
   fatigue I was experiencing with my own photographs.

   Do you ever feel like you‚Äôre in a rut? As much as I have fun with the
   food I share with you, I have felt lately that I am on autopilot. While
   its good to have a system that works for me, and efficiency is
   certainly important, I needed to throw a wrench in it. To challenge
   myself to try something different.

   Enter this photograph:

   Photo Credit: Con Poulos

   Photographed by Con Poulos for Donna Hay‚Äôs cookbook, Seasons, this
   seemingly straightforward scene is the subject of this month‚Äôs Donna
   Hay Styling & Photography Challenge. Hosted by the wonderful Simone of
   Jungle Frog Cooking, the idea behind the challenge is to study and
   analyze the inspiring photographs taken by the talented photographers
   behind the scenes of Donna Hay‚Äôs cookbooks.

   I typically stay away from this aspect of food blogging ‚Äì there are so
   many fun challenges one can participate in: between cooking your way
   through Dorie Greenspan, being a Daring Baker, and wondering Does My
   Blog Look Good In This? ‚Äì there‚Äôs enough to keep one busy for years.
   But this one caught my eye. I respect Simone and her work. And while I
   certainly did not approach this challenge as one that would foster
   copying (or as I have called it, inbreeding) in food photography, I
   think the point is that it can be interesting to understand just what
   it took to capture these images that make us want to cook.

   Besides, I had the fresh bread. And the arugula. And the prosciutto.

   And I was hungry.

   The Bruschetta with Mozzarella, Prosciutto and Arugula Pesto was melt
   in your mouth delicious. It took minutes to prepare, and just a few
   minutes more to eat until my plate was empty. But photographing it?
   Much harder than it looks.

   The seemingly unfussy photo was a challenge to replicate. My excuses?
   My table is too dark. The light was dim from a passing rain storm. My
   props were different.

   But enough of my excuses.

   I love this shot, but it was way too close, in comparison to the
   original. There was something else wrong.

   When I first set up my shot, I was on autopilot, with my light source
   coming from 9 o‚Äôclock. The curve of the table and the chair in the
   background matched the original, but the lighting definitely was not.
   So, I had to flip things around.

   With the light coming from 3 o‚Äôclock, and the styling more stark, I
   stay as true as I can to Con Poulos‚Äô original. I can appreciate the
   clarity of the knife and the more subtle shadow on the left side of the
   plate, though I wish I could have a lighter mood to the photograph. But
   this does speak to the passing rain clouds that afternoon, and the
   darkness of at my kitchen table.

   In the end, my favorite shot was the one that matched the photograph‚Äôs
   lighting, but incorporated a little more interest in the background
   with the plate of pesto as well as more of the chair. But the biggest
   lesson for me was scaling back. Learning to work with minimal items in
   the shot. Working on balance.

   And when you think about it, that easily translates into good, simple
   cooking ‚Äî it‚Äôs an important reminder to keep things clean, without the
   fuss, and to focus on the few ingredients at hand. This bruschetta
   certainly represents that, and more.

Bruschetta with Mozzarella, Prosciutto and Arugula Pesto

   Bruschetta with Mozzarella, Prosciutto and Arugula Pesto Bruschetta
   with Mozzarella, Prosciutto and Arugula Pesto Print Recipe

Ingredients

   8 slices of bread
   1 clove garlic, halved
   extra virgin olive oil (to brush on bread)
   4 pieces mozzarella (it is equally tasty with goat cheese)
   8 slices prosciutto
   freshly ground black pepper

   FOR THE ARUGULA PESTO
   1 handful basil (or you can use all arugula)
   2 handfuls rocket arugula
   1/3 cup toasted pine nuts
   1/4 cup grated Parmesan
   1/2 garlic clove
   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

Instructions

   Make the pesto by placing the basil, arugula, pine nuts, Parmesan and
   garlic in the bowl of a food processor and pulse so that it still
   chunky. With the motor running, add the olive oil. Try to make sure the
   pesto still has some body and is not thin.

   Brush both sides of bread lightly with olive oil. Toast the bread on a
   grill pan or in a toaster. Rub both sides with garlic clove. Spread
   pesto on top, and layer with cheese and prosciutto.

       first time I heard about this challenge was last month on Kankana‚Äôs
       (Sunshine & Smile) blog.
       I browsed then through previous galleries and I was surprised to
       see some (most) of those that took the challenge had a better photo
       than the original.
       The original photo seems like dead nature, while other come to
       life, they make me crave them!

       Hi Liren,
       Being on auto-pilot happens to us all. The only way out of it is as
       you did, to challenge ourselves. Your shots are fantastic. I agree
       with you about adding the pesto in the background it adds another
       great element to the photo. Thanks for sharing, the bruschetta
       looks fantastic!

       improve their photography. I want to learn but I‚Äôve been too lazy

       O yeah! You made it despite the webhosting troubles!! I too love
       this challenge as it makes me think outside the box and outside of
       my comfort zone. I tend to stick to what I know and the things I do
       best but that doesn‚Äôt help me grow or learn more and this challenge
       is just great in that respect. And you‚Äôve done a great job too,
       especially with the limited lighting you had since I do think the
       original has a bit brighter light coming in from the right. What I
       struggled with a lot of and I know most others did too was the
       perspective of the various elements. it drove me nuts!
       In the end I loved the dish and isn‚Äôt that all that matters.
       great job and hope to see you again next month! And we will have
       prizes to win then!

   Styling & Photography Challenge 6

   I was sleepily scrolling through my Facebook feed last week when a link
   from Happyolks caught my eye. One click, and I found myself nodding
   along as I read a very honest and thoughtful post on food photography.
   It was as though someone had taken a peek into my heart and felt the
   fatigue I was experiencing with my own photographs.

   Do you ever feel like you‚Äôre in a rut? As much as I have fun with the
   food I share with you, I have felt lately that I am on autopilot. While
   its good to have a system that works for me, and efficiency is
   certainly important, I needed to throw a wrench in it. To challenge
   myself to try something different.

   Enter this photograph:

   Photo Credit: Con Poulos

   Photographed by Con Poulos for Donna Hay‚Äôs cookbook, Seasons, this
   seemingly straightforward scene is the subject of this month‚Äôs Donna
   Hay Styling & Photography Challenge. Hosted by the wonderful Simone of
   Jungle Frog Cooking, the idea behind the challenge is to study and
   analyze the inspiring photographs taken by the talented photographers
   behind the scenes of Donna Hay‚Äôs cookbooks.

   I typically stay away from this aspect of food blogging ‚Äì there are so
   many fun challenges one can participate in: between cooking your way
   through Dorie Greenspan, being a Daring Baker, and wondering Does My
   Blog Look Good In This? ‚Äì there‚Äôs enough to keep one busy for years.
   But this one caught my eye. I respect Simone and her work. And while I
   certainly did not approach this challenge as one that would foster
   copying (or as I have called it, inbreeding) in food photography, I
   think the point is that it can be interesting to understand just what
   it took to capture these images that make us want to cook.

   Besides, I had the fresh bread. And the arugula. And the prosciutto.

   And I was hungry.

   The Bruschetta with Mozzarella, Prosciutto and Arugula Pesto was melt
   in your mouth delicious. It took minutes to prepare, and just a few
   minutes more to eat until my plate was empty. But photographing it?
   Much harder than it looks.

   The seemingly unfussy photo was a challenge to replicate. My excuses?
   My table is too dark. The light was dim from a passing rain storm. My
   props were different.

   But enough of my excuses.

   I love this shot, but it was way too close, in comparison to the
   original. There was something else wrong.

   When I first set up my shot, I was on autopilot, with my light source
   coming from 9 o‚Äôclock. The curve of the table and the chair in the
   background matched the original, but the lighting definitely was not.
   So, I had to flip things around.

   With the light coming from 3 o‚Äôclock, and the styling more stark, I
   stay as true as I can to Con Poulos‚Äô original. I can appreciate the
   clarity of the knife and the more subtle shadow on the left side of the
   plate, though I wish I could have a lighter mood to the photograph. But
   this does speak to the passing rain clouds that afternoon, and the
   darkness of at my kitchen table.

   lighting, but incorporated a little more interest in the background
   with the plate of pesto as well as more of the chair. But the biggest
   lesson for me was scaling back. Learning to work with minimal items in

   And when you think about it, that easily translates into good, simple

   certainly represents that, and more.

       Liren, this is such a great post! It‚Äôs comforting to hear that even
       someone like you, whose photography I admire so much, still has
       days where you feel like you‚Äôre in a rut. I loved hearing about
       your process for these shots, and I think they turned out
       wonderfully!

       Liren, great shots! I saw Donna Hay challenge on Kankana‚Äôs site
       last month and I really admire people who try extra harder to
       improve their photography. I want to learn but I‚Äôve been too lazy
       and carried away with busy daily schedule. I think at some point I
       need to push myself. Beautiful photos. Delicious bruschetta too!

       Delicious, rustic flavors on this bruschetta, Liren. My kinda food
       for any time of the day. I think your version of the image‚Ä¶turned
       out much livelier and vibrant than the original (IMO :) ).
       Beautifully done and I like the contrast against the dark back.

       O yeah! You made it despite the webhosting troubles!! I too love
       this challenge as it makes me think outside the box and outside of
       my comfort zone. I tend to stick to what I know and the things I do
       best but that doesn‚Äôt help me grow or learn more and this challenge
       is just great in that respect. And you‚Äôve done a great job too,
       especially with the limited lighting you had since I do think the
       original has a bit brighter light coming in from the right. What I
       struggled with a lot of and I know most others did too was the
       perspective of the various elements. it drove me nuts!
       In the end I loved the dish and isn‚Äôt that all that matters.
       great job and hope to see you again next month! And we will have
       prizes to win then!

            Simone, a late thank you! I can‚Äôt tell you how I needed this
            challenge at this time. So looking forward to the next one.
            I‚Äôm off to your site to check it out :)

       Beautiful Liren! I sure am glad you were hungry and had all the
       ingredients on hand.
       I like the glass on the dark background behind the food, it kind of
       pulls the eye over the bruschetta and then back again for another
       look at that delicious plate of food;-)

   http://kitchenconfidante.com/?p=13396#comment-279727 Hi Inger, it is
   indeed four (4) tomatillos. You will note that in step 1, all the
   tomatillos are blended together after roasting. Then, in step 3, the
   soup as a whole is blended in batches. If you have an immersion (stick)
   blender, then you can just go ahead and blend it all together, but for
   standard blenders, I always recommend blending the hot soup in batches
   for safety. I hope that helps! <p>Hi Inger, it is indeed four (4)

   http://kitchenconfidante.com/?p=13396#comment-279723 Can anyone who
   made this recipe clarify the the amount of tomatillos they have used?
   The recipe calls for 4 medium tomatillos, then blend in batches. Seems
   like 4 tomatillos could be blended in one batch.. Perhaps this recipe
   has a typo and it should be 4 pounds or 40 medium tomatillos? Thanks!

   I&#039;m so sorry to hear that, Sue. Did you use the same hummus?
   I&#039;m curious if it was a problem with the batter, or perhaps not
   baking long enough; ovens do vary in terms, in which case you may have
   had to adjust the baking time. <p>I&#8217;m so sorry to hear that, Sue.
