   Git ____________________

   Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
   designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
   speed and efficiency.

   Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast
   performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce,
   and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient
   staging areas, and multiple workflows.
