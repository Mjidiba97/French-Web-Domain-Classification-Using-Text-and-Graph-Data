   "Standard" packages are those that do not require the DCH driver
   components.

   "DCH" (Declarative, Componentized, Hardware Support Apps) refers to new
   packages preinstalled by OEMS implementing the Microsoft Universal
   Driver paradigm.

   DCH drivers cannot be installed over a standard system, and Standard
   drivers cannot be installed over a DCH system.

   To confirm the type of system you have, locate Driver Type under the
   System Information menu in the NVIDIA Control Panel.

   "Standard" packages are those that do not require the DCH driver
   components.

   "DCH" (Declarative, Componentized, Hardware Support Apps) refers to new
   packages preinstalled by OEMS implementing the Microsoft Universal
   Driver paradigm.

   DCH drivers cannot be installed over a standard system, and Standard
   drivers cannot be installed over a DCH system.

   To confirm the type of system you have, locate Driver Type under the

NVIDIA Synapse

   Tout comme le cerveau humain, les réseaux de neurones peuvent apprendre
   et s’adapter. Les capacités de programmation intrinsèquement parallèles
   des GPU en font un support privilégié pour des méthodes d’apprentissage
   automatique comme le Deep Learning.
   À propos de cette création : Pour créer des milliers de neurones avec
   des fonctions de transmission dynamique des signaux, un code Python a
   été spécialement créé afin de générer et de manipuler efficacement un
   grand nombre de structures ramifiées en simultané. Ce code a permis de
   générer un rendu reproduisant l’apparence et le comportement des
   connexions neuronales.
