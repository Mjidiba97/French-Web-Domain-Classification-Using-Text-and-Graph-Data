Check Close Variants Your Ads Are Showing For

   Google changed how Close Variants work and now exact match keywords may
   also show an ad when Google believes the meaning of the search is the
   same as the keyword. Kind of like a synonym, but potentially even
   broader.
   So here's a script you can use to see exactly what Google considers to
   be a 'close variant'. The script pulls all queries that were triggered
   by close variants. It also pulls the associated keyword. It joins the
   query and keyword and then puts the data on a spreadsheet.
   [close%2Bvariant%2Bkeyword%2Banalysis.png]
   On the spreadsheet, you can see line by line what the keyword is and
   what the close variant is. If you want, you can compare metrics to
   decide if a close variant that seems a little odd may actually be
   outperforming the keyword.
   I thought it'd also be interesting to add an automatic way to see how
   close the query is to the keyword. Whereas going from the keyword
   [optmyzr] to 'opmyzr' seems like a definite good case of a close
   variant because it's a simple typo in a brand name, going from
   [campsites in yosemite] to 'campgrounds yosemite' may be too much of a
   stretch from the original keyword.
   To calculate the similarity of the close variant to the keyword, I
   found an algorithm for the Levenshtein distance which counts the number
   of characters that must be deleted, edited or added to go from one
   string to another string. A big number in the Levenshtein column means
   the query is more different from the keyword.
   Grab the code below to try it in your Google Ads account. I've also
   included a table showing how match types work after the change from
   Google and a video that goes through using the script in case anyone is
   just getting their feet wet with scripts.

Automatically Refresh Weather Data in a Spreadsheet

   Bidding by weather is a classic example of the power of AdWords Scripts
   but the code from Google can be daunting to implement for scripting
   newbies. Recently my company Optmyzr launched the ability to connect
   external data to a Rule Engine, making it possible to bid by weather
   without writing any code.
   A solution like this uses a Google Sheet that is automatically updated
   with current weather conditions. While adding the API calls to fetch
   the weather is straightforward, getting it to automatically refresh
   this data is difficult. This post covers a solution for updating
   external data on a spreadsheet automatically.
   First, grab a copy of this Google Spreadsheet that contains a function
   courtesy of Mogsdad on StackOverflow that handles updating the weather.
   It does this by removing and then adding back all functions that deal
   with importing external data.
   This spreadsheet also contains the API connection strings that fetch
   the temperature and conditions for a zip code.
   [Weather%2BAPI%2BURL.jpg]
   To be able to use the weather API, be sure to put in your own API key
   on the settings sheet. You can request one
   from OpenWeatherMap.orghttps://openweathermap.org/appid#get.
   [Add%2BAPI%2Bkey%2Bto%2Bget%2Bweather%2Bdata.jpg]
   To automatically update the weather on a schedule, set a time-based
   trigger for the function RefreshImports by going to the "Tools" menu in
   the spreadsheet and selecting "Script Editor" and then clicking the
   fields shown in the screenshot below:
   [Add%2Ba%2Btime%2Btrigger.jpg]
   You'll also need to update the code at line 17 to reference the ID of
   your own copy of the spreadsheet. For example, grab this part of the
   URL:
   [what%2Bis%2Bthe%2Bid%2Bof%2Ba%2Bgoogle%2Bspreadsheet.jpg]
   And put that into line 17 of the script that's associated with the
   spreadsheet here:
   [where%2Bto%2Bcopy%2Bthe%2BID.jpg]
   That's it. Now you have a spreadsheet that automatically refreshes with
   current weather data and you can use it for other AdWords automations.

Automatically Put Pivoted AdWords Data in a Spreadsheet

   I've written several free scripts that export AdWords data to a Google
   spreadsheet but the one I'll share below does something a little more
   and pivots the reports so that segment data shows up in columns rather
   than rows.

The Problem With Google's AdWords Reports

   Here's what the typical output from an AdWords report looks like if you
   use a script like this one to add it in a Google sheet.

                           [AdWords-Report-With-Segments.jpg]
        AdWords report data that was automatically added to a Google
    spreadsheet. The report contains keyword conversion data segmented by
     conversion type name and day of week, resulting in multiple rows of
                           data for each keyword.

   I highlighted the cells for the same keyword ID in green so that you
   can easily see that there are 7 rows of data for the same keyword. Each
   row has different values for the segments 'ConversionType' and
   'DayOfWeek'.
   Here's why I don't like getting my reports this way... In a typical
   AdWords optimization, I might evaluate a keyword to see if it meets
   certain criteria, and when it does, change the bid. For example, for
   keywords with more than 5 total "Sign Up" conversions, and at least 2
   of those conversions on today's day of the week,  I might raise the
   bid.
   This is not easy to do with the spreadsheet above because I can't
   simply build a formula for each row as that would ignore the data from
   the other 6 rows about the same entity.

A Better Format for AdWords Reports

   To get the report the way I want, I need to do some vlookups and data
   aggregation so that all the data for a keyword is moved onto a single
   row. This is what my spreadsheet should look like to make optimizing
   easy:

                      [AdWords-Data-In-Spreadsheet-With-Pivot.jpg]
    AdWords report data that is aggregated by entities. Here there is one
    row for every keyword along with one column for every combination of
                            metrics and segments.

   Now you can see there is only 1 row for that same keyword ID as before
   (highlighted in green). Now I can write a spreadsheet formula that has
   access to all the elements I need on one row.

How Scripts Solved This Problem

   To get the spreadsheet output in the format I wanted, I wrote a script
   that finds all possible values for the included segments and then
   combines this with the different metrics. For example, possible values
   for the DayOfWeek segment are 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', etc.
   Combining this with my metrics, I get Monday.Conversions,
   Monday.AllConversions, etc. Each of these is then treated as a column
   in the sheet.
   So now I can more easily do my optimization. I could also feed this
   sheet into a tool like Optmyzr's Rule Engine so that I could start
   automating account management based on factors like day of week, type
   of conversion, or any other segment I include on the sheet. Optmyzr is
   my company and also runs this blog.

How to run this script:

   After installing the script code that's all the way at the bottom of
   this post into an AdWords account (a child account, not an MCC
   account), you can edit the following settings to customize it:
    1. attributes: these are the AdWords reporting attributes. You will
       get a single spreadsheet row per unique combination of attributes
    2. segments: these are the AdWords reporting segments. The values of
       each segment will be joined with metrics and create 1 column for
       each combination
    3. metrics: the AdWords reporting metrics to include.
    4. sourceReport: the report type from Google. See the link below for
       more information
    5. spreadsheetUrl: the Url of the Google spreadsheet that this script
       will update.
    6. tabName: the name of the sheet (tab) in the spreadsheet that should
       be updated.
    7. reportVersion: the version of the AdWords API reports you’re using.
       The data available in the Ads API changes periodically so this
       ensures our script talks to the right version of AdWords.

Where to Find Valid Settings for the Script

   Here is the list of acceptable attributes, segments and metrics for the
   keywords performance report:
   https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/reports/keyword
   s-performance-report. As you can see, Google makes it really easy to
   see what are attributes vs. segments vs metrics. Just be sure to
   populate the right settings in the script based on what type of data
   you're adding.
   [attributes-segments-metrics.jpg]
   So for example, if you wanted to add ApprovalStatus to the report,
   you'd put add it to the comma separated list of attributes as seen
   here:
   [attributes.jpg]
   Here is the full list of all AdWords reports with the available
   attributes, segments, and metrics to help you create correct settings.

One thing to watch out for:

   Note that in the resulting spreadsheet, you can't total up the numbers
   across a row because metrics are included multiple times, once per
   included segment. For example, in a report with the 2 segments
   DayOfWeek and ConversionType, if a keyword has 10 conversions, then the
   sum of all the conversion columns for that row will be 20 (10
   conversions * 2 segments).

Another Popular Script For Putting AdWords Data in Spreadsheets

   Last June I wrote a script that makes it super easy to do custom data
   pulls from AdWords and put the data in a spreadsheet so I was happy to
   hear people still talking about this script at SMX West in March. You
   can find it on Search Engine Land if you're looking for more options to
   get AdWords data in spreadsheets without paying someone for it.

Working with Experiment Campaigns in AdWords Scripts

   If you've started using Google's Draft and Experiment campaigns, you
   may have noticed some odd behavior with scripts. We were getting these
   campaigns back in our selectors, even if they were no longer active
   experiments. And if we tried to change their status to 'ended', we
   couldn't do so.
   I'll explain the similarities and differences so that hopefully you can
   avoid some of the frustration I faced when we started using experiments
   in AdWords and some scripts started to break.
   Experiment campaigns are like other campaigns in the following ways:
    1. Experiment campaigns are returned in API reports
       like CAMPAIGN_PERFORMANCE_REPORT
    2. Experiment campaigns are returned by AW Scripts selectors like
       campaignSelector = AdWordsApp.campaigns()

   Experiment campaigns are unlike normal campaigns in some important
   ways:
    1. Experiment campaigns, once enabled are always enabled. If you end
       the experiment, the ServingStatus becomes 'ENDED' but the
       CampaignStatus remains 'ENABLED'
    2. Experiment campaigns cannot have labels
    3. Experiment campaigns cannot have their status or budget changed (as
       these are tied to the corresponding 'base' campaign)

   As you can see, there are situations where some of these oddities can
   lead to issues. For example, if you have a script that pauses any
   campaigns that have exceeded a certain budget for the month (like those
   that Optmyzr provides), the script will recognize that an experiment
   campaign has spent too much but it will be unable to label it or pause
   it.
   So I wanted to exclude experiment campaigns from my selectors and found
   this was possible and documented. You can exclude campaigns of
   different types by adding the following to a selector:
     * withCondition("CampaignExperimentType = BASE")
     * withCondition("CampaignExperimentType = DRAFT")
     * withCondition("CampaignExperimentType = EXPERIMENT")

   But there is also an undocumented feature in AdWords Scripts that can
   help filter these campaigns:
     * withCondition("ServingStatus = SERVING")

   The other possible condition values are ENDED, PENDING, NONE, SUSPENDED
   The cool trick I learned here is that you can use conditions that are
   not documented in the AdWords Scripts reference. You just refer to the
   fields in the corresponding API report and try adding them to
   selectors.
   Thanks to Alex from the Google team for pointing this out.

Check Close Variants Your Ads Are Showing For

   Google changed how Close Variants work and now exact match keywords may

   So here's a script you can use to see exactly what Google considers to

   outperforming the keyword.
   I thought it'd also be interesting to add an automatic way to see how
   close the query is to the keyword. Whereas going from the keyword
   [optmyzr] to 'opmyzr' seems like a definite good case of a close

Automatically Refresh Weather Data in a Spreadsheet

   Bidding by weather is a classic example of the power of AdWords Scripts
   but the code from Google can be daunting to implement for scripting
   newbies. Recently my company Optmyzr launched the ability to connect
   external data to a Rule Engine, making it possible to bid by weather
   without writing any code.
   A solution like this uses a Google Sheet that is automatically updated
   with current weather conditions. While adding the API calls to fetch
   the weather is straightforward, getting it to automatically refresh
   this data is difficult. This post covers a solution for updating
   external data on a spreadsheet automatically.
   First, grab a copy of this Google Spreadsheet that contains a function
   courtesy of Mogsdad on StackOverflow that handles updating the weather.
   It does this by removing and then adding back all functions that deal
   with importing external data.
   This spreadsheet also contains the API connection strings that fetch
   the temperature and conditions for a zip code.
   [Weather%2BAPI%2BURL.jpg]
   To be able to use the weather API, be sure to put in your own API key
   on the settings sheet. You can request one
   from OpenWeatherMap.orghttps://openweathermap.org/appid#get.
   [Add%2BAPI%2Bkey%2Bto%2Bget%2Bweather%2Bdata.jpg]
   To automatically update the weather on a schedule, set a time-based
   trigger for the function RefreshImports by going to the "Tools" menu in
   the spreadsheet and selecting "Script Editor" and then clicking the
   fields shown in the screenshot below:
   [Add%2Ba%2Btime%2Btrigger.jpg]
   You'll also need to update the code at line 17 to reference the ID of
   your own copy of the spreadsheet. For example, grab this part of the
   URL:
   [what%2Bis%2Bthe%2Bid%2Bof%2Ba%2Bgoogle%2Bspreadsheet.jpg]
   And put that into line 17 of the script that's associated with the
   spreadsheet here:
   [where%2Bto%2Bcopy%2Bthe%2BID.jpg]
   That's it. Now you have a spreadsheet that automatically refreshes with
   current weather data and you can use it for other AdWords automations.

Automatically Put Pivoted AdWords Data in a Spreadsheet

   I've written several free scripts that export AdWords data to a Google
   spreadsheet but the one I'll share below does something a little more
   and pivots the reports so that segment data shows up in columns rather
   than rows.

The Problem With Google's AdWords Reports

   Here's what the typical output from an AdWords report looks like if you
   use a script like this one to add it in a Google sheet.

                           [AdWords-Report-With-Segments.jpg]
        AdWords report data that was automatically added to a Google
    spreadsheet. The report contains keyword conversion data segmented by
     conversion type name and day of week, resulting in multiple rows of
                           data for each keyword.

   I highlighted the cells for the same keyword ID in green so that you
   can easily see that there are 7 rows of data for the same keyword. Each
   row has different values for the segments 'ConversionType' and
   'DayOfWeek'.
   Here's why I don't like getting my reports this way... In a typical
   AdWords optimization, I might evaluate a keyword to see if it meets
   certain criteria, and when it does, change the bid. For example, for
   keywords with more than 5 total "Sign Up" conversions, and at least 2
   of those conversions on today's day of the week,  I might raise the
   bid.
   This is not easy to do with the spreadsheet above because I can't
   simply build a formula for each row as that would ignore the data from
   the other 6 rows about the same entity.

A Better Format for AdWords Reports

   To get the report the way I want, I need to do some vlookups and data
   aggregation so that all the data for a keyword is moved onto a single
   row. This is what my spreadsheet should look like to make optimizing
   easy:

                      [AdWords-Data-In-Spreadsheet-With-Pivot.jpg]
    AdWords report data that is aggregated by entities. Here there is one
    row for every keyword along with one column for every combination of
                            metrics and segments.

   Now you can see there is only 1 row for that same keyword ID as before
   (highlighted in green). Now I can write a spreadsheet formula that has
   access to all the elements I need on one row.

How Scripts Solved This Problem

   To get the spreadsheet output in the format I wanted, I wrote a script
   that finds all possible values for the included segments and then
   combines this with the different metrics. For example, possible values
   for the DayOfWeek segment are 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', etc.
   Combining this with my metrics, I get Monday.Conversions,
   Monday.AllConversions, etc. Each of these is then treated as a column
   in the sheet.
   So now I can more easily do my optimization. I could also feed this
   sheet into a tool like Optmyzr's Rule Engine so that I could start
   automating account management based on factors like day of week, type
   of conversion, or any other segment I include on the sheet. Optmyzr is
   my company and also runs this blog.

How to run this script:

   After installing the script code that's all the way at the bottom of
   this post into an AdWords account (a child account, not an MCC
   account), you can edit the following settings to customize it:
    1. attributes: these are the AdWords reporting attributes. You will
       get a single spreadsheet row per unique combination of attributes
    2. segments: these are the AdWords reporting segments. The values of
       each segment will be joined with metrics and create 1 column for
       each combination
    3. metrics: the AdWords reporting metrics to include.
    4. sourceReport: the report type from Google. See the link below for
       more information
    5. spreadsheetUrl: the Url of the Google spreadsheet that this script
       will update.
    6. tabName: the name of the sheet (tab) in the spreadsheet that should
       be updated.
    7. reportVersion: the version of the AdWords API reports you’re using.
       The data available in the Ads API changes periodically so this
       ensures our script talks to the right version of AdWords.

Where to Find Valid Settings for the Script

   Here is the list of acceptable attributes, segments and metrics for the
   keywords performance report:
   https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/reports/keyword
   s-performance-report. As you can see, Google makes it really easy to
   see what are attributes vs. segments vs metrics. Just be sure to
   populate the right settings in the script based on what type of data
   you're adding.
   [attributes-segments-metrics.jpg]
   So for example, if you wanted to add ApprovalStatus to the report,
   you'd put add it to the comma separated list of attributes as seen
   here:
   [attributes.jpg]
   Here is the full list of all AdWords reports with the available
   attributes, segments, and metrics to help you create correct settings.

One thing to watch out for:

   Note that in the resulting spreadsheet, you can't total up the numbers
   across a row because metrics are included multiple times, once per
   included segment. For example, in a report with the 2 segments
   DayOfWeek and ConversionType, if a keyword has 10 conversions, then the
   sum of all the conversion columns for that row will be 20 (10
   conversions * 2 segments).

Another Popular Script For Putting AdWords Data in Spreadsheets

   Last June I wrote a script that makes it super easy to do custom data
   pulls from AdWords and put the data in a spreadsheet so I was happy to
   hear people still talking about this script at SMX West in March. You
   can find it on Search Engine Land if you're looking for more options to
   get AdWords data in spreadsheets without paying someone for it.

Working with Experiment Campaigns in AdWords Scripts

   If you've started using Google's Draft and Experiment campaigns, you
   may have noticed some odd behavior with scripts. We were getting these
   campaigns back in our selectors, even if they were no longer active
   experiments. And if we tried to change their status to 'ended', we
   couldn't do so.
   I'll explain the similarities and differences so that hopefully you can
   avoid some of the frustration I faced when we started using experiments
   in AdWords and some scripts started to break.
   Experiment campaigns are like other campaigns in the following ways:
    1. Experiment campaigns are returned in API reports
       like CAMPAIGN_PERFORMANCE_REPORT
    2. Experiment campaigns are returned by AW Scripts selectors like
       campaignSelector = AdWordsApp.campaigns()

   Experiment campaigns are unlike normal campaigns in some important
   ways:
    1. Experiment campaigns, once enabled are always enabled. If you end
       the experiment, the ServingStatus becomes 'ENDED' but the
       CampaignStatus remains 'ENABLED'
    2. Experiment campaigns cannot have labels
    3. Experiment campaigns cannot have their status or budget changed (as
       these are tied to the corresponding 'base' campaign)

   As you can see, there are situations where some of these oddities can
   lead to issues. For example, if you have a script that pauses any
   campaigns that have exceeded a certain budget for the month (like those
   that Optmyzr provides), the script will recognize that an experiment
   campaign has spent too much but it will be unable to label it or pause
   it.
   So I wanted to exclude experiment campaigns from my selectors and found
   this was possible and documented. You can exclude campaigns of
   different types by adding the following to a selector:
     * withCondition("CampaignExperimentType = BASE")
     * withCondition("CampaignExperimentType = DRAFT")
     * withCondition("CampaignExperimentType = EXPERIMENT")

   But there is also an undocumented feature in AdWords Scripts that can
   help filter these campaigns:
     * withCondition("ServingStatus = SERVING")

   The other possible condition values are ENDED, PENDING, NONE, SUSPENDED
   The cool trick I learned here is that you can use conditions that are
   not documented in the AdWords Scripts reference. You just refer to the
   fields in the corresponding API report and try adding them to
   selectors.
   Thanks to Alex from the Google team for pointing this out.
