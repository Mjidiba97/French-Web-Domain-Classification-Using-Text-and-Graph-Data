Dating in Ireland: look in the right place

   Whether you hang your hat in Dublin, Limerick, Galway or elsewhere, on
   EliteSingles you can find local singles on your wavelength. We help
   people across Ireland find their special someone and a relationship
   that really works for the long-term.

   For both town and country-dwellers, it may often seem tricky to meet Mr
   or Mrs Right. But with us you don’t need to compromise on what you’re
   looking for – or how far you have to travel to find them. Our site has
   singles across Ireland who share the same commitment to finding their
   long-term partner. From the bustle of Dublin to Ireland’s beautiful
   countryside, dating in Ireland might often feel like a needle in a
   haystack scenario. To meet someone with whom you have real chemistry,
   it’s about knowing where to look.

   Local people who join us for dating in Ireland aren’t in the market for
   something casual; they’re looking for the real deal. Most of our
   members are professional, educated singles, aged 30-55 and serious
   about finding real love. Sound familiar? Then join them today and take
   the first step towards relationship happiness.

Dating in Ireland with EliteSingles

   Ireland may not be the largest of countries, but it’s the size of our
   personalities that really make us stand out from the crowd. At
   EliteSingles we recognise this, helping Irish singles with the most
   suitable personalities find each other easily. While the Irish may be
   better than most at getting out and enjoying their leisure time, it’s
   becoming more common to hear singles talk about of prioritising their
   careers over their romantic lives, or not quite managing to get to know
   new people in the buzz of city-life.

   Dating in Ireland is made easier with online dating sites such as
   EliteSingles, so if you're ready to start looking for that someone
   special, it's time to register with us.

Compatibility matters

   Being ‘compatible’ is often mentioned as the key to a long-term
   relationship. But what exactly does that mean? At EliteSingles we
   ensure it really stands for something; for us, compatibility doesn’t
   stop at people sharing the same hobbies and interests. While important,
   sharing a love for music might not be enough to get you through the
   good times and the bad. Our website understands relationship
   compatibility more deeply than that. We think for a couple to go the
   distance they need true compatibility in their personalities, as well
   as harmony in their long-term dating goals.

   We also recognise that our members are busy, have tried meeting someone
   offline and haven’t met the person who really feels right. That’s why
   we designed our Smart Profiling system around introducing local singles
   whose personalities genuinely suit. We also ensure users can define the
   kind of person they want to meet; you might be a single parent hoping
   to meet other singles with kids, or a Christian looking to meet someone
   who shares your faith. Whatever it may be, by specifying your partner
   requirement we can offer more accurate partner suggestions, which means
   that you don’t have to wade through the profiles of unsuitable members;
   we help you find the ones with real relationship potential. Dating in
   Ireland with a difference!

Moving your communication offline

   When you connect with someone through us you can be confident in
   getting along well. Nonetheless, as close a fit as a couple might look
   on paper, the exciting part is seeing if you two have that often
   elusive ‘chemistry’ when you first meet in the flesh.

   The first time you go on a date through us is a big stage in your
   journey. Fortunately, we’ll help you as much as we can; not only are
   you likely to get along well after being matched and talking online,
   but we also offer our members all the advice they need to ensure your
   date goes as smoothly as possible. For those returning to dating after
   some time, it can be invaluable to learn about body language tips, read
   advice on taking your relationship to the next stage, or simply get
   some inspiration for your next date. You can read it all in our online
   magazine.

   Dating in Ireland needn’t be so difficult. If you’re looking for local
   singles on your wavelength, EliteSingles is the place to look. We’re
   committed to finding love for all our members – register today and see
   who you can meet.

   EliteSingles › About us

About us

   EliteSingles is brought to you by Spark Networks Services GmbH, one of
   Europe’s leading online matchmaking providers. Founded in 2008 in
   Berlin, (former Affinitas) launched its first online dating portal
   eDarling in Germany in May 2009. Today, the company has earned the
   trust of more than 13 million singles, creating on average 2000 couples
   every month in over 20 countries worldwide.

   EliteSingles is a partnership service designed for Irish singles
   looking for a long-term commitment. Our smart profiling delivers
   compatible partner suggestions in line with your personal search
   preferences, and we offer manually verify all new profiles to ensure
   users have a smooth, safe environment in which to meet other
   like-minded singles.

   Our vision is to maintain the industry's highest standards – to be the
   dating site as committed as our members are to finding love.  Numerous
   certifications and awards testify how successful we already are in this
   area. Nevertheless, the most important indicator of the value of our
   work is, and will always remain, the couples that meet each other
   through our platforms on a daily basis.

Our Matching Process

   The EliteSingles matching process introduces members on the basis of an
   initial personality questionnaire and your individual search
   preferences. We curate the site by manually verifying all profiles,
   automatically removing inactive members, and proactively removing users
   we suspect are not serious. This means our members have a smooth
   browsing experience and can focus on dating.

   The EliteSingles personality profile is based on the “Big Five” model
   of personality psychology. Initially developed in the 1990s, it is one
   of the most important and renowned concepts in modern psychology. Using
   the results of five personality dimensions, we are able to identify
   couples who are particularly well suited to a long and happy
   relationship together. Then, if the couple's demographic data and
   personal preferences are also a match, the two members are suggested to
   each other.

   The demographic data we consider includes gender, age, residence,
   profession and level of education. Additionally, in order to match
   personal preferences we explore various aspects that could be
   significant for long-term relationship prospects. For instance, we ask
   "How important is your future partner's religion?" and "Do you want
   children? “

   Protecting your personal information is of our utmost priority. We
   utilise Manual Profile Verification, SSL Encryption and a Fraud
   Detection System to make sure members feel safe online. All sensitive
   data is encrypted and will not be revealed to any third party or other
   members.

   EliteSingles is also available in the United Kingdom, Australia, New
   Zealand, Canada and South Africa.

Serious Online Dating

   EliteSingles is the dating agency for Irish men and women who are
   serious about finding a happy, long-term relationship. We believe that
   lasting love starts with a compatible match, so we take your location,
   personality, lifestyle and dating ambitions into account;

   it’s an intelligent matchmaking formula we know works. Part of Spark
   Networks Services GmbH – one of Europe’s leading networks of dating
   sites – we create over 2000 couples every month on average, in more
   than 20 countries worldwide.

   matchmaking

Intelligent, Thoughtful Matchmaking

   EliteSingles matches are made with longevity in mind, but that’s not
   all. We aim to deliver a smooth browsing experience that ensures you
   can easily find Irish singles with whom you share real chemistry. When
   suggesting a match we consider your individual partner criteria,

   your location and your personality traits in order to introduce you to
   3-7 new people per day. Compared to other dating sites, this method
   streamlines and focuses your search - much better when you're new to
   online dating or searching for love again.

Success Stories

   Eddie & Tracy

     We met for coffee in Dublin on 2 occasions and after the 2nd time,
     we both kissed, and we knew there was a spark, as we couldn't stop
     smiling.

   Adam & Alison

     I am very happy. Alison and I met thanks to Elite singles. Both
     actually only being on there for 1 or 2 days.

   Alix & Rory

     Despite the fact that she lives in England and I in Dublin, we met
     and began what is now a serious relationship. I can only say that
     meeting Alix has turned my life around and we are now planning our
     future together.

     Looking for someone who is educated and motivated hasn't always been
     easy for me. After checking out EliteSingles, I decided to give it a
     try. I had to play around with the settings a little, but the people
     I am being suggested are precisely what I am looking for. So far, so
     good. Claire - Dublin

     I had seen commercials for EliteSingles, and was originally
     hesitant. But after registering and interacting with the site, I was
     impressed with the quality of my partner suggestions and just how
     much they took into consideration what I was looking for in my
     search for a partner. I have to admit I have been pleasantly
     surprised. Mark - Galway
