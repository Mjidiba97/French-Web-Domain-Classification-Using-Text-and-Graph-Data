   Last Updated and Effective as of: May 15, 2018

   Media.Net Advertising FZ-LLC, including our affiliates and
   subsidiaries, (individually and/or collectively, "Media.Net," "we,"
   "us" or "our") makes available the website located on the Internet at
   uniform resource locator (URL) www.media.net/ ("Website").

About Our Business

   Media.net utilizes its ad serving technology (our "Technology") to
   generate and present targeted advertising on behalf of the advertisers
   and publishers participating in our advertising marketplace (our
   "Partners"). This Privacy Policy describes the kinds of information we
   collect about consumers on sites operated by our Partners that use our
   Technology ("Partner Sites") and how we use and share that information.
   This Privacy Policy also describes the kind of information we collect
   from and about our Partners that voluntarily signup for our services.
   Consumers and Partners from which we collect information are sometimes
   referred to "you" or "your", as applicable.

NAI Membership

   We are a member in good standing of the Network Advertising Initiative
   (NAI), an industry body committed to responsible data collection for
   digital advertising and establishing responsible business and data
   management practices and standards. We are in compliance with the NAI's
   Code of Conduct and you can learn more about the NAI by visiting
   http://networkadvertising.org.

DAA Adherence

   Media.net adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”)
   Self-Regulatory Principles and you can learn more about their practices
   by visiting http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org.

Information Collection

Personally Identifiable Data

   When you register to participate in Media.net’s program for use of
   Media.net Technology as an advertiser or publisher, we require you to
   provide us with some Personally Identifiable Data. “Personally
   Identifiable Data” is information that can specifically identify you.
   Your provision of your Personally Identifiable Data to us is completely
   voluntary. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Data unless you
   submit that information to us. Personally Identifiable Data is not
   collected on Partner Sites through the operation of our Technology
   itself. Categories of Personally Identifiable Data we may collect
   include:
     * Identity Data, which includes name or other similar identifiers.
     * Contact Data, which includes address, email address and telephone
       numbers.
     * Financial Data, which includes payment details including details
       about payments to and from you.

Personal Data

   Additionally, we may also collect certain others types of information
   that, along Personally Identifiable Data, may be considered and
   specifically named "Personal Data" in certain jurisdictions, including
   the European Union (“EU”), such as:
     * Technical Data, which includes internet protocol (IP) address,
       cookies, browser and device information, mobile device identifiers,
       location data and your login data.
     * Usage Data, which includes information about how you use our
       Website and Partner Sites and advertising we serve on those sites
       including how many times you viewed the ad, clicked the ad etc to
       improve our Services and also mitigate fraudulent activities.

Cookies

   We collect Technical Data and Usage Data regarding your behavior and
   usage patterns on our Website, on our mobile applications (to the
   extent downloaded to your mobile device) and on our Partner Sites. We
   collect this type of information about you using cookies, web beacons,
   and other web tools ("Tools"). We do not use these Tools to store any
   Personally Identifiable Data. We do not have access to or control the
   Tools used by third parties on our Website or on any Partner Sites, and
   this policy does not govern the use of Tools by these third parties.
   Some of the Tools and the ways in which we use them are further
   described below:
     * To inform us if an advertisement has been served to the same
       computer before, and if so, when the advertisement was served.
       These cookies are not used by Media.net to build a profile of a
       user’s behavior nor are they used by Media.net for the purposes of
       behavioral tracking or behavioral targeting.
     * To conduct research and identify fraud and malicious activity
     * When you visit one of our Partner Sites, we may assign your
       computer one or more cookies which enable us and our Partners to
       deliver targeted advertisements. This form of advertising is called
       “behavioral advertising” or “interest based advertising”. We
       believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see ads
       that are relevant to your interests. However, if you would like to
       opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please see the
       section titled “Opt-Out” below.

   Unless you choose to provide it to us, our Technology does not collect
   any sensitive consumer information about you during the ad delivery
   process. Our Technology does not, for example, collect any social
   security numbers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers,
   precise real-time geographic location derived through location-based
   services, nor any specific information about your past, present, or
   potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including
   genetic, genomic or family medical history.
   Further, while our Technology does not deliver targeted ads based on
   precise medical conditions or treatments or market prescription drugs,
   we may generate and serve targeted ads for general health products that
   do not require a prescription. Examples may include certain health
   categories like dietary supplements, fitness equipment, weight-loss
   products, skin-care products etc. For a full list of our health related
   segments, please click here.
   IF YOU ARE SITUATED IN THE EU, PLEASE SEE THE SECTION “ADDITIONAL EU
   DISCLOSURES” THAT PERTAIN TO OUR COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR
   PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA AND PERSONAL DATA AND ADDITIONAL RIGHTS
   YOU HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

Information Sharing

   Subject to the section titled “Additional EU Disclosures”, Personally
   Identifiable Data is generally only submitted to us by our publisher or
   advertiser Partners in connection with their use of our Technology and
   we use this Personally Identifiable Data to service their accounts and
   respond to inbound inquiries related to sales or technical support
   requests.

   In addition, we use your Personal Data for a variety of purposes,
   including:
     * sharing it with third parties such as advertising partners, ad
       networks, publishers, data providers and corporate affiliates in
       order to provide our services, conduct internal analysis to perform
       and improve our services and associated technologies;
     * combining data we collect about you with data we obtain from our
       business partners, ad networks, and/or other companies such as data
       providers, including our corporate affiliates in order to provide
       our services, conduct internal analysis in order to perform and
       improve our services;
     * inferring eligibility of users for interest, geographic and
       demographic-based segments;
     * presenting advertisements tailored to interests you have shown;
     * determining whether you have seen a particular advertisement before
       so as to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements;
     * identifying fraud and malicious activity
     * understanding the patterns of people who see advertisements;
     * providing insights and reporting back to our business partners,
       including statistical reporting in connection with the activity on
       a website or mobile application, optimization of location of ad
       placement, ad performance, reach and frequency metrics, billing,
       and logging ads served on a particular day to a particular website
       or application;
     * evaluating the probability and nature of connections between
       devices; and
     * creating online advertising models through lookalike modelling or
       similar research methodologies.

   Subject to the section titled “Additional EU Disclosures”, we may share
   the information we collect about you with certain third parties in the
   following ways:
     * We may, from time to time, use business partners, operational
       service providers and subcontractors ("Service Providers") to
       operate and provide our services to Partners and to comply with
       legal and regulatory requirements. As necessary under this Privacy
       Policy, our Service Providers are required to protect the
       information we provide them in a manner that is consistent with
       this Privacy Policy. Although we exercise care in selecting our
       Service Providers and require them to protect information as
       mentioned above, they are independent third parties and we are not
       responsible for their privacy practices.
     * We may rent, sell, or share aggregated information and other
       information that is not Personally Identifiable Data with third
       parties for multiple reasons, including to develop and deliver
       targeted advertising and to conduct general business analysis.
       Information that we collect to create segments and profile
       information for our service may be shared with our Partners. We may
       combine information we collect with additional information
       collected from other sources. Please note that this Privacy Policy
       does not cover any third party's use or handling of your
       information once it is shared. While we do not collect Personally
       Identifiable Data about you when you view or interact with an ad,
       there is a possibility that our Technology and our Partners will
       make assumptions or infer things about you (or anyone using your
       devices or browsers) in order to display more relevant ads.
     * We provide information to third parties for legal process (e.g., in
       response to a subpoena or civil or criminal investigative demand,
       court order, or a request from law enforcement or other government
       agency); to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend
       against legal claims; to protect the security and integrity of our
       assets and business operations; or as otherwise required by law. In
       addition, we may disclose your information when we believe it is
       appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or
       take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or
       other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or
       safety of Media.net, our Partners, our users, our employees, or
       others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law
       enforcement; or to enforce the terms of service of our Website or
       other agreements or policies.
     * We may also provide information to third parties in connection with
       a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our
       business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or
       in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

Your Choices

Opting out of interest based advertising

   As noted above, our Technology uses cookies. Your browser may give you
   the ability to adjust your settings to delete or disable cookies. If
   you choose to disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain
   features on our Partner Sites you visit or take full advantage of our
   Technology. You can also opt-out of receiving personalized ads from us
   and other third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of
   the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). The NAI's opt-out tool can
   be found here http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. More
   information about system privacy controls and instructions for opting
   out via your mobile device can be found at
   http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice. We comply with the
   Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising set forth
   by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). Please note that if you use
   a different web browser, computer, clear, block, delete or restrict
   your cookies after opting out, you may need to repeat your choices.

Data Retention

   We will only retain information relating to you for as long as
   necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for
   the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
   requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for such
   information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the
   information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or
   disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process your
   information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other
   means, and the applicable legal requirements. Unless contrary to
   applicable laws, except with respect to information about our Partners
   with whom we have an ongoing relationship, our policy is to retain the
   non-aggregated information we collect for up to 24 months, after which
   the data is either anonymized or deleted from our systems. And as
   permitted by law, we may continue to retain aggregated information. In
   some circumstances, if you are an EU data subject, you can ask us to
   delete your Personal Data by sending us an email to privacy@media.net.

Children

   Our Website is intended for an audience above the age of 18. Neither
   our Website nor our Technology / advertising services are developed
   for, intended for, or directed at, children, and we do not knowingly
   collect information about children under the age of 16 (or such other
   age as may be restricted under local law). If you believe your child
   has provided his or her information to us, please contact us at
   privacy@media.net.

   the EU and have any complaints regarding our privacy practices, you
   have the right to make a complaint at any time to your local

Legal basis for our processing of your Personal Data

   Below are the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process

       conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the
       best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We
       make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both
       positive and negative) and your rights before we process your
       Personal Data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your
       Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by
       the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise
       required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further
       information about how we assess our legitimate interests against
       any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by
       contacting us at privacy@media.net.
     * Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is
       necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a
       party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a
       contract.
     * Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your
       Personal Data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or
       regulatory obligation that we are subject.
     * Consent means where you have consented to a certain use of your
       Personal Data.

Withdrawing your consent

   If we are relying on your consent to process your Personal Data, you
   have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You have the right
   to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at
   privacy@media.net.

Modifications to this Privacy Policy

   We may edit, amend, modify, and update our Privacy Policy at any time
   and from time to time, by posting updated text on or links to our
   Website. When we make material changes to our Privacy Policy or our
   privacy practices, we will notify you by posting a notice on our
   Website or providing a notice to you. We display the Effective Date at
   the top of our Privacy Policy so that you will know when there has been
   a change in its effective date. By using our Website or our Technology
   or any Partner Site using our Technology after the effective date, you
   will have agreed and be deemed to have agreed to comply with and be
   legally bound by the updated Privacy Policy.

Cross border transfers

   Our Website and technology infrastructure is maintained in the United
   States. If you are visiting our Website or Partner Sites from the
   regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ
   from those in the United States, please note that you may be
   transferring your information to the United States and in other
   countries around the world. You freely and specifically give us your
   consent to export and use your information within the United States and
   in other countries as specified in this Privacy Policy. You understand
   that Personal Data stored in the United States may be subject to lawful
   requests by the courts or law enforcement authorities in the United
   States. If you are situated in the EU, whenever we transfer your
   Personal Data out of the EU, we ensure appropriate and suitable
   safeguards are used in such transfer. Where we use certain service
   providers, we may use specific contracts including data processing
   agreements based on the EU/EEA Standard Contractual Clauses

Third Party Practices

   This Privacy Policy applies solely to our privacy practices. We are not
   responsible for the privacy practices of our Partners, Service
   Providers or any third parties, even if our ads contain links to third
   party websites and even if we have a business relationship with that
   third party. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of each
   and every website that you visit to be sure you understand the terms
   and conditions that apply to you from each of them.
