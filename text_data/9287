   When we refer to “Geox” c” below, we are referring to Geox S.p.A. and
   the companies of the Geox group.
   For purely organisational and functional requirements, we have
   appointed certain service providers to manage the Website as external
   personal data processors. This is strictly for purposes related and
   connected to the services provided by the Website, including the sale
   of products. A complete list of external data processors appointed by
   Geox may be obtained by contacting privacy@geox.com.


2. Types of Personal Data Processed

   Registration is not required in order to access the Website. However,
   there are sections of the Website that require registration or the use
   of a username and password (e.g., to log in to the My Geox reserved
   area, or to complete the online purchasing process), or services for
   which you need to provide your details (e.g. your personal data may be
   requested to access newsletter services, to contact us, etc.). Click
   here for further information. With reference to data relating to
   navigation within the Website, see also point 7 below concerning the
   Profiling Tools used by the Website.


3. Optional provision of personal data

   The provision of personal data is generally optional. In certain cases
   only, the failure to provide personal data may make it impossible to
   access specific services and obtain what you have requested (e.g.
   registration - and the provision of personal data, e-mail address,
   postal address, credit/debit card data or bank details and telephone
   number - is required to purchase products online); failure to provide
   such data may therefore prevent Geox from allowing you to access the
   Website's services or to respond to users' requests. The data necessary
   in each case are indicated in the data collection forms t on the
   Website - e.g., indicated with a (*) - and the consequences of their
   not being provided are set out in the specific notices on the data
   collection pages.


4. Purposes

   Data are collected and processed for purposes strictly related to the
   use of the Website, its services and the purchase of products online.
   The purposes for which the data are used are detailed in the specific

COOKIE POLICY


   The website www.geox.com (the "Website") uses "Cookies": that is, a
   text file which is sent from a web server (i.e. the computer which
   “hosts” the website visited) to the user’s browser (Internet Explorer,
   Mozilla Firefox, Google, etc.) and stored in the device, whether fixed
   or mobile, which the user employs for browsing. The cookies enable the
   Website to identify the user’s device, through the information stored
   therein, whenever said user connects to the Website through that
   device. Through the use of cookies, we can make it easier for the user
   to navigate the Website. We can also analyse the user’s preferences and
   tastes through browsing verification, which consequently allows us to
   promote the products and services that are more consistent with the
   user's interests and expectations. .

   Cookies can be “session cookies” (when they are stored solely for the
   length of the browsing session on the website and deleted when the
   browser is closed), or “persistent cookies” (when they are stored for a
   longer period, until they expire or are erased by the user).

   Cookies do not collect information directly identifying the user. In
   fact, Geox cannot, through the use of cookies, track any personally
   identifiable information (e.g. first name, last name) unless this is
   provided directly by the user.


1. What types of cookies are used by the Website

   Technical Cookies

   These are cookies used to facilitate navigation and therefore the
   computerised transmission of data over the network or strictly
   necessary for the provision of the services provided by the Website.
   These cookies are usually temporary and known as “session cookies”.
   They are sent from the Website to the user’s computer while browsing,
   but are stored only for the length of the browsing session. This means
   that when the user closes his/her browser, the cookies are
   automatically deleted and disappear without being stored on the user’s
   computer. These cookies are formed by random numbers generated by the
   server to enable secure and efficient exploration of the Website.
   Through the use of such cookies, we are able to facilitate the user’s
   browsing within the Website, for example by recalling the data the user
   has provided when completing forms on the Website (so-called user-input
   cookies), to recognise the user after he/she has logged in to the
   Website (so-called authentication cookies), to customise the interface
   of the website based on the preferences indicated by the user and to
   collect aggregate data on the number of website visitors and the most
   visited pages, etc. (so-called cookies analytics used with mechanisms
   to partially obscure IP addresses). Such cookies do not require the
   user’s prior and express consent as they are absolutely necessary in
   order to provide the service the user has requested on the Website

   Profiling Cookies

   These cookies are designed to create user profiles, for example, in
   order to send advertising consistent with the user’s preferences:
   except as provided in paragraph 3 below, such cookies are sent from the
   Website to the user’s computer while browsing and are stored after the
   end of the browsing session, until they expire or the user deletes
   them. (the so-called “persistent cookies”).

   The use of such cookies requires the user's express and informed
   consent.

   Please note that your consent will only be requested when you first
   access the Website: thereafter, thanks to the use of a technical
   cookie, we will store your consent to allow you direct access to the
   pages of the Website upon your return (subject to your right to
   deactivate/activate cookies at any time or delete them: in this case,
   when you return, the Website will request your consent again).

   No other user profiling tools are used on this Website (e.g. spyware).

   In addition, if the user registers with the Website and provides
   his/her specific consent to the monitoring of his/her browsing during
   registration, data relating to said user’s navigation on the Website
   may be associated with his/her personal data

   identifies the user’s navigation (the so-called “record”) within our
   database; a pseudo-random alphanumeric session ID, automatically

   that are automatically deleted when the browser is closed), as well as
   permanent cookies (or cookies that are kept until the user deletes
