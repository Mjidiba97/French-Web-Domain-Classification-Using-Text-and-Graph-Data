Welcome!

   This is the official web site of tcpdump, a powerful command-line
   packet analyzer; and libpcap, a portable C/C++ library for network
   traffic capture.

   libpcap, as well as current development snapshots, a complete
   documentation, and information about how to report bugs or contribute
   patches.

Documentation

   Full documentation is provided with the source packages in man page
   format. People with Windows distributions are best to check the Windows
   PCAP page for references to WinDUMP. What follows are the man pages
   formatted in HTML (using man2html) and some tutorials written by
   external contributors.
     * Tcpdump man page
     * Main pcap man page (MORE pcap man pages)
     * Tcpdump.org Frequently Asked Questions
     * Programming with pcap by Tim Carstens.

   can be found at GitHub: libpcap. You can clone the tcpdump GitHub
   repository using
    git clone https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump.git

   and can clone the libpcap GitHub repository using
    git clone https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap.git

   You can then configure and compile the source via the normal GNU
   autoconf method.

   You are also encouraged to submit patches in the form of git trees
   hosted on GitHub or elsewhere.

   The continuous integration systems below automatically build the
   current development versions of tcpdump and libpcap:
     * Travis CI: tcpdump (Linux and macOS) [tcpdump.svg?branch=master]
     * Travis CI: libpcap (Linux and macOS) [libpcap.svg?branch=master]
     * OpenCSW: tcpdump (Solaris)
     * OpenCSW: libpcap (Solaris)

Patches, Bug Reports and Feature Requests

   Bugs and patches are tracked through GitHub. Please submit them using
   the following resources:

   For libpcap (please read the guidelines for contributing first):
     * Submit bugs and feature requests on the issue tracker.
     * Submit patches by forking the branch at GitHub: libpcap and issuing
       a pull request.

   For tcpdump (please read the guidelines for contributing first):

How to Contribute

   Tcpdump and libpcap are open source software and anyone can make
   contributions. Basically we need people to:
     * Download and test versions of libpcap and tcpdump on their platform
     * Contribute code
     * Maintain web pages (less important now)
     * Maintain binary/RPM packages

   If you want to contribute, please subscribe to the tcpdump-workers
   mailing list. It's a good idea to discuss bugfixes and new feature
   additions in advance, because the changes may have bigger implications
   than you think and your patch may not get accepted.
