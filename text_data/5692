   3. Provided by End Users giving the prescriptive consent.

   Tappx’ s Services consist in connecting Publishers inventory with
   Advertisers or agents buying this inventory on their behalf with the
   final aim of placing digital advertisements (“Tappx Services”).


   For the purpose of performing Tappx Services, Tappx needs to collect
   minimum data from End Users. In the normal course of business, Tappx
   shall not receive any directly identifiable Personal Data. “Personal
   Data” means any information that can help to identify a natural person,
   or relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.


   In order to perform its Services, Tappx will use its tracking and
   tagging technology on the Inventory. This technology allows Tappx to
   collect End User basic information, like:

   What information Tappx will collect
     * Device and app information– this category includes your device's
       type and model, system language, the device's operating system
       (such as Android or iOS), SDK version, mobile carrier name, mobile
       browsers installed on the device (such as Chrome or Safari, your
       device's IP address, and identifiers assigned to your device, such
       as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising
       ID, or other types of unique device identifiers (a number uniquely
       allocated to your device by your device manufacturer).
     * Ad information– this category includes information about the online
       ads and personalized content we have served (or attempted to serve)
       to you. It includes things like how many times an ad has been
       served to you, what page the ad appeared on, whether you viewed,
       clicked on or otherwise interacted with the ad, ad engagement
       history and whether you visited the Advertiser’s website,
       downloaded an app or purchased the product or service advertised.
     * Location information– Tappx collects information about your general
       location (such as country). For example, we may use the IP address
       to identify your general location. This information does not tell
       us where your device is precisely located. This information is sent
       as a normal part of internet traffic. In addition, we also collect
       implicit location information, which allows us to infer that you
       are either interested in a place or that you might be at the place
       – this information does not actually tell us where your device is
       precisely located.

   In addition, Tappx may collect the precise location of your device
   (using GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, Bluetooth
   signals, Beacons signals and cell tower ids that can be used to derive
   or estimate precise location, or other geo-location data), when
   location services have been enabled by the end user for the mobile app
   or website that uses our SDK (you typically have to choose to turn on
   device-based location services).
     * Log information– this category includes the app or website visited,
       time zone, and network connection type (e.g., WiFi, cellular).
     * Information from advertising partners ("Advertisers") and other
       third parties– this category includes information we receive from
       our Publishers, Advertisers and other Partners that we work with to
       help us deliver ads and personalized content to you and recognize
       you across browsers and devices. This may include pseudonymous
       advertiser identifiers that some Advertisers or other third party
       ad platforms choose to share with us. This information is also used
       to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device.
     * Demographic Information – this category includes information like
       gender, age, marital status, year of birth.


   Referred Collectively “Ad Data”


Tappx Role when processing Ad Data

   Depending on the way Tappx will collect Ad Data Tappx will operate as a
   Independent Data Controller or just a pure Processor following
   Publisher’s instructions and directions, not having in any case direct
   relationship with the End Users whose information Tappx will process.
   “Data Controller" means an entity that determines the purposes and
   means of the processing of Personal Data.  Processor" means an entity
   that processes Personal Data on behalf of a Data Controller.

   In any case, Tappx will process Personal Data only on the legal grounds
   allowed under EU Data Protection Laws including General Data Protection
   Regulation (Contractual Necessity, Legitimate Interest and Consent).


Permitted uses of Ad Data

     * Serving ads and promoting apps– allowing Publishers to promote
       advertising, apps and content in their mobile apps or web display,
       and to allow Advertisers to bid on Publishers’ inventory.
     * Serve interest-based advertising and personalized content– enable
       our partners to infer interests and serve ads and personalized
       content to users based on their behavior, app activity and inferred
       interests. We will not serve interest-based ads or personalized
       content based on information that we consider sensitive, such as
       race, religion or health. An End User is not under any obligation
       to provide us with any Personal Data. In cases, where an End User
       is from EEA, we serve them interest-based advertisements, only when
       they have given us their express consent to use their Personal Data
       to enable us to serve interest based ads directed to them. Even if
       you opt-out of interest-based advertising or have not given your
       express consent to interest-based advertising, you will still
       receive ‘generic’ ads from Tappx which are context based or better
       known as ‘contextual advertising’. EEA means, the European Economic
       Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland
     * Ad reporting and conversions– measure ad performance, report to
       Advertisers or Demand Partners when and how users have viewed or
       clicked on their ads, or visited their website, and to report to
       Publishers when and how ads were shown on their properties and were
       clicked on.
     * Analytics and frequency capping– allow our Publishers to analyze
       their applications (for this purpose, we use aggregated and
       anonymous benchmark data) and prevent users from seeing the same ad
       too many times. We also use usage information to analyze our web
       traffic, to figure out how often customers use parts of the site,
       to improve the site and generally to make it appealing to as many
       users as possible.
     * Fraud detection and prevention– identify invalid or incentivized
       clicks (or ad queries) and protect Tappx and our partners from
       fraudulent behavior.
     * Enforce our policies, resolve disputes and communicate with you.
     * Providing and improving our services– audit, research and analyze
       information in order to maintain, protect, and improve our services
       and develop new services, and to ensure that our technologies
       function properly.


   Collectively, “Permitted Purposes”


Information Sharing

   We share information about you with:


     * A Publisher whose app you have accessed to– we share information
       about how you have interacted with that Publisher's app and its ads
       and personalized content, if any tailored ad.
     * An Advertiser or Demand Partners whose site or app you have
       visited– we share information about how you have interacted with
       that Advertiser’s site, app or its ads.
     * With our service providers– we contract with companies who help
       with parts of our business operations (for example, storage of
       information, fraud control and monitoring). We require that our
       service providers only use your information in connection with the
       services they perform for us.
     * In connection with legal proceedings– when we are under a legal
       obligation to do so, for example to comply with a binding order of
       a court, or where disclosure is necessary to exercise, establish or
       defend the legal rights of Tappx, our Partners or any other third
       party.
     * In connection with a sale of our business– if a third party
       acquires some or all of our business or assets, we may disclose
       your information in connection with the sale.
     * In addition, we may disclose aggregated, anonymized information
       with other third parties. This information cannot be used to
       identify you.


Ways to Collect Information


   Tappx have developed different technological tracking tools to collect
   information from End User device, such as:


     * Our SDK – the SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers
       (such as our Publishers) can include in their apps to enable ads
       and personalized content to be shown, data to be collected, and
       related services to be implemented.
     * Along with our Partners, we may use tracking technologies such as
       cookies, JavaScript, beacons and Local Storage such as HTML5. Our
       Partners may also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash.
       Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 and Local Storage Objects (LSOs)
       such as Flash are used to store content information and
       preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools
       for removing HTML5 LS’s. Beacons are clear graphic image(s) of 1×1
       pixel that is delivered through a web browser usually as part of a
       webpage request. Web beacons operate as a tag that records an End
       Users visit to a particular webpage.
     * Our Publisher may use cookies to track your behavior on their apps
       or websites. A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a
       browser. The browser provides this piece of text to the originating
       server when the visitor returns. Most web browsers are initially
       configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so
       your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a
       cookie is being sent. Also, you are free to delete any existing
       cookies at any time. Please note that some features of Tappx may
       not function properly when cookies are disabled or removed.
     * JavaScript is a dynamic object oriented computer programming
       language. JavaScript is used to understand the End User's behavior
       on an app or website.
     * Directly from the Publisher through Server to Server (S2S) or Video
       Vast Tags etc.


Consent Control

   Access to Ad Data through Tappx SDK. Tappx implemented a Consent
   Management Platform in our own SDK that allow to read and transmit
   information about which vendors and which purposes an end user has
   consented to with vendors.

   Tappx will follow IAB standards and Consent Management Platform
   compliant with IAB requirements, in our own SDK in order to allow Tappx
   to read and transmit information about which purposes the end user has
   consented.

Online Behavioral Advertising:

   We use third parties who collect data about their apps' and sites'
   visitors through their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies
   regarding your online activities, in an effort to understand your
   interests and deliver you advertisements that are tailored to your
   interests.

   These third parties include Publishers, Advertisers and ad networks
   that may collect information about when you view or interact with one
   of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your
   online activities over time and across different apps and websites.

   Like most Advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will
   be most relevant to the recipient. When an End User visits a
   third-party website or app on which that network advertising company
   has purchased ad space, the advertising company can then recognize the
   individual's interest and deliver one of our advertisements.


End User choice and Opt-Out.

   Ads delivered through Tappx SDK will allow End Users to out-put with a
   mechanism that permits End Users to set their preferences.

   End Users in the EEA can withdraw their consent given to Tappx to
   collect and process data to optimize interest-based ads, either by
   revoking such consent on the page or app where they have found
   reference to Tappx as a partner or by writing to dpo@tappx.com
   indicating on it their Google Advertising ID (android) or IDFA (ios).
   Without this technical information we cannot find the user and
   therefore comply with your revocation request.

   If you do not consent to the treatment of your data, the advertisements
   you will see will be less adjusted to your interests.


Information Retention and Access to Information


   We may retain personally identifiable information we process on behalf
   of our Clients for  a period of up to twelve (12) months unless
   otherwise required by law or applicable contract. After the period,
   Tappx may retain and use such data in an aggregated format, as
   necessary for internal analytical purposes, to comply with its legal
   obligations, resolve disputes and enforce agreements. We may adopt
   shorter retention periods if so directed by our Clients.

   Please note that in most of the cases we have no direct relationship
   with the End Users. An End User who seeks access, or who seeks to
   correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information should direct his
   query to the relevant Publisher. If an End User requests us to remove
   any personally identifiable information relating to him or her, we will
   respond to their request within a reasonable timeframe.

Security

   Tappx has implemented reasonable security measures in order to protect
   your information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
   alteration or destruction. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse
   or alteration to information will not occur; we make good faith efforts
   to prevent such occurrences. We do not warrant or represent that your
   account or any of your information will be protected against, loss,
   misuse, or alteration by third parties.


International transfers

   Tappx may transfer the information we collect about you to countries
   other than the country where we originally collected it for the
   purposes of storage and processing of information and operating our
   services. Those countries may not have the same information protection
   laws as your country. However, when we transfer your information to
   other countries, we will protect that information as described in this
   Privacy Policy and take steps, where necessary, to ensure that
   international transfers comply with applicable laws. We ensure it is
   protected by making sure at least one of the following safeguards is in
   place:
     * by transferring your personal information to a country that has
       been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the
       European Commission;

     * by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission
       which give your personal information the same protection it has
       within the EEA including to US;

   where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if
   they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide
   similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.

   Children Information

   Tappx does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable
   information (including persistent device identifiers) relating to
   children under the age of 13. In addition, we require our Publishers to
   certify to us that their services (such as their mobile apps) are not
   primarily directed to appeal to children under the age of 13, and to
   avoid sharing with us any personally identifiable information relating
   to children under the age of 13.

   Please note that while we strive hard to ensure that our policies are
   respected, we cannot be held responsible for the practices of our
   Publishers. Our publishers are responsible to ensure that their privacy
   practices comply with applicable privacy laws and requirements.

   If you have knowledge of any incident in which we may be collecting
   personally identifiable information relating to children under the age
   of 13, or that our SDK is included in any service (such as a mobile
   app) that is directed to or aimed to appeal to audience under the age
   of 13, please let us know immediately by contacting us
   at: privacy@tappx.com, and we will remove their personally identifiable
   information from our servers without delay.

   The following section will only apply, if You are a Data Subject as
   defined under General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and also to
