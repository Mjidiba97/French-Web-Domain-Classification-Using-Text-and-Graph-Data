   Samsung Android Rumors

   Prices of the Samsung Galaxy Note10 and Galaxy Note10+ arriving on
   August 7 have surfaced.

   According to an industry tipster, the Galaxy Note10 in Europe will
   start at 999 ($1,125) and the Note10+ at 1,149 ($1,295). The base
   models of both the phones will come with 256GB storage.

   The prices of these phones may differ from region to region, though,
   depending on the discounts and other deals offered by the retailers.

   Samsung hasn't divulged much about the Note10 duo but leaked renders
   revealed that the Note10 and Note10+ have similar designs, except that
   the latter comes with a larger screen and an extra camera at the back.

   Previous leaks have also confirmed the removal of headphone jack and
   Bixby button from the Note10 series, with the power key moved to the
   left below the volume rocker.

   We are still over three weeks away from the official unveiling of the
   Note10 series, but you can expect to hear a lot more about it in the
   coming days.

   There's no lag when a husband and wife are "connected" in bed. :D And
   there's no lag when family is all together under one roof or in the
   same room so essentially it's all quite a perfect sync after all xD

   Nope, that is not how the human brain works. We're not super computers
   with super conducting terminator senses. We're pretty slow and
   extremely laggy by nature. We can't discern visual lag in the low tens
   of milliseconds and bluetooth 5 has much less...

   /> <p>OnePlus doesn't release too many phones so when a new one comes
   it's a major thing. And today the OnePlus 7T is making its debut at two
   parrallel events taking place in and New Delhi. Worry not though, you
   don't need to travel to either city to learn all about the novelties as
   you can just follow the live stream from the comfort of your couch or
   office chair.. The event is going to be all about the OnePlus 7T with
   the 7T Pro unlikely to be seen. There's an outside chance that we'll
   get a "one more thing" or at least a teaser ahead of the second event
   in London on October 10. The...</p>

   /> <p>Huawei introduced the Mate X earlier this year and we even got a
   chance to play with it for a bit. The company's currently targeting a
   launch in October, so the R&D department is already shifting its
   attention to its successor. A Huawei patent, filed with USPTO (United
   States Patent and Trademark Office) features like the Mate X was
   trademarked, but with a compartment for a flat stylus. According to the
   rough design and the visualizations, made by LetsGoDigital, the new
   device will be refined, with a thinner camera/battery setup.
   Interestingly enough, it is designed to go into a...</p>

   Huawei Mate 30 Pro climbed to the top of the DxOMark camera ranking,
   beating the Galaxy Note10+ by 4 points in the overall score. The still
   photo score of 131 is the highest yet and is what helped push the phone
   to the top. The Mate 30 Pro went through the new review process, which
   includes tests for the ultra wide camera and the phone's night mode.
   The Mate aced the Night test (it currently holds the highest score) and
   its zoom camera did an admirable job - it's 3x instead of 5x zoom like
   on the P30 Pro, which means it delivers better performance at medium
   zoom (though it falls behind...</p>

   <p>According to a new report from XDA-Developers, an upcoming Xiaomi
   phone will bring 8K (76804320) video recording at 30 fps. The
   information was found in the MIUI 11 Camera APK but the interesting bit
   is that no current Xiaomi phone can even shoot videos in 8K. Even the
   recently announced Mi Mix Alpha which comes with Samsung's 108MP Bright
   HMX tops out at 6K at 30 fps. Currently, only Samsung's Exynos 9820 and
   9825 chipsets support 8K video recording at 30 fps so it looks like
   this Xiaomi phone will come with Qualcomm's next-generation flagship
   SoC. The only phone on the market that...</p>

   Nope, that is not how the human brain works. We're not super computers
   with super conducting terminator senses. We're pretty slow and
   extremely laggy by nature. We can't discern visual lag in the low tens
   of milliseconds and bluetooth 5 has much less...

   /> <p>OnePlus doesn't release too many phones so when a new one comes
   it's a major thing. And today the OnePlus 7T is making its debut at two
   parrallel events taking place in and New Delhi. Worry not though, you
   don't need to travel to either city to learn all about the novelties as
   you can just follow the live stream from the comfort of your couch or
   office chair.. The event is going to be all about the OnePlus 7T with
   the 7T Pro unlikely to be seen. There's an outside chance that we'll
   get a "one more thing" or at least a teaser ahead of the second event

   /> <p>Huawei introduced the Mate X earlier this year and we even got a
   chance to play with it for a bit. The company's currently targeting a
   launch in October, so the R&D department is already shifting its
   attention to its successor. A Huawei patent, filed with USPTO (United
   States Patent and Trademark Office) features like the Mate X was
   trademarked, but with a compartment for a flat stylus. According to the
   rough design and the visualizations, made by LetsGoDigital, the new
   device will be refined, with a thinner camera/battery setup.
   Interestingly enough, it is designed to go into a...</p>

   Huawei Mate 30 Pro climbed to the top of the DxOMark camera ranking,
   beating the Galaxy Note10+ by 4 points in the overall score. The still
   photo score of 131 is the highest yet and is what helped push the phone
   to the top. The Mate 30 Pro went through the new review process, which
   includes tests for the ultra wide camera and the phone's night mode.
   The Mate aced the Night test (it currently holds the highest score) and
   its zoom camera did an admirable job - it's 3x instead of 5x zoom like
   on the P30 Pro, which means it delivers better performance at medium
   zoom (though it falls behind...</p>

   <p>According to a new report from XDA-Developers, an upcoming Xiaomi
   phone will bring 8K (76804320) video recording at 30 fps. The
   information was found in the MIUI 11 Camera APK but the interesting bit
   is that no current Xiaomi phone can even shoot videos in 8K. Even the
   recently announced Mi Mix Alpha which comes with Samsung's 108MP Bright
   HMX tops out at 6K at 30 fps. Currently, only Samsung's Exynos 9820 and
   9825 chipsets support 8K video recording at 30 fps so it looks like
   this Xiaomi phone will come with Qualcomm's next-generation flagship
   SoC. The only phone on the market that...</p>

   and they literally come in every shape and size. This isn't an
   exaggeration, the Echo Loop is a smart ring with a built-in microphone,
   speaker and an all-day battery life. Amazon's new Echo Loop is the
   smallest smart device yet Alexa is just a tap away (to save battery,
   there's no wake word support). You can use the ring to make calls,
   control your smart home and do everything in Alexa's ever-growing

   <p>Samsung is expected to reveal their latest "s" upgrade in the
   popular A-series with the new Galaxy A70s. The device has already
   passed through Geekbench to show out its specs. Just last week, the
   phone was spotted on TENAA and its support page even went live for a
   brief period. Now a new Google Play console listing confirms that the
   phone will indeed feature an FHD+ display alongside the Snapdragon 675
   chipset and 6GB RAM. Samsung Galaxy A70s TENAA images Previously we
   learned the phone will be a minor refresh of the Galaxy A70 but will
   come with a new prism gradient design...</p>

   /> <p>Oppo is launching the Reno Ace with 65W fast charging and
   Snapdragon 855+ and now the company revealed the midranger Oppo K5 will
   tag along. According to a Weibo post on the official account of the
   manufacturer, October 10 will be the launch date of the phone that will
   have a 64 MP shooter and a Snapdragon 730G chip. The K5 is already
   popping up on Chinese retailers' websites with full renders and key
   specs. Looking at them, we can easily see the similarities between the
   Realme X2 and Oppo K5, and we shouldn't be surprised - both brands are
   sharing much of their manufacturing and...</p>

   /> <p>Samsung's Galaxy Note line got larger than usual this year with
   the launch of both the Note10 and the Note10+, but the Korean company
   may add yet another member at some point in the future. The folks over
   at SamMobile have dug up a model number for an upcoming Samsung phone,
   which comes with some intriguing possibilities if you're familiar with
   the company's naming scheme. Samsung Galaxy Note10 It's the SM-N770F.
   The "N" in there clearly means this is a Galaxy Note, but the flagship
   Notes all have N9xx model numbers. Way back when in 2014, the only
   other N7xx handset came out, and...</p>

   rumor mill is already moving on to the next generation. We've seen
   reports about the possible display sizes which will range from 5.4 to
   6.1 and 6.7-inches alongside smaller notches and 5G support. Noted
   Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's latest prediction details that next year's
   iPhones will bring a radical design change with a throwback to the
   iPhone 4 chassis. Kuo details that 2020 iPhones will bring a flat metal
   frame and 2.5D glass construction. The new design and 5G support are

   Richard Yu said at IFA that the foldable Huawei Mate X will be
   available in October or November at the latest. Since then the launch
   window has been narrowed down to October, at least for China. The info
   comes from Huawei's customer service. A global launch may follow in
   November, but we'll have to keep an eye on Huawei's news outlets.
   Though as mass production of the phone picks up, we expect info to make
   its way to the Internet through unofficial channels too. Huawei Mate X
   The Mate X was originally configured with a Kirin 980 chipset and an

   early details about the next flagships. Back in May Samsung announced
   it started mass production of its new 5x optical module and now a
   report from South Korean tech news outlet The Elec claims that the
   Galaxy S11 series will debut with the new periscope unit alongside a
   108MP main shooter. Samsung Electro-Mechanics has a video which shows
   the new sensor in action. The module comes with a thin 5mm profile

   about the A70s, but the company has uploaded a user manual on the
   support page of its Indian website with the phone's schematics, which
   reveal the A70s will flaunt a design similar to the Galaxy A70's. On
   the front, the Galaxy A70s will have a waterdrop notch display with a
   fingerprint reader underneath. And around the back, it will sport a

   Samsung devices in line for the Android 10 update. Now, reports are
   circulating that the latest Android version is already being tested on
   the Galaxy S9 and S9+. The phones were spotted running firmware
   versions G960FXXU7DSI3 and G965FXXU7DSI3 which signals that Samsung is
   hard at work optimizing the new version of Android for its older
   flagships. There is no clear time-frame when we can expect to see
   Android 10 on the Galaxy S9 series but it will certainly arrive after
   Samsung pushed the update to its S10 and Note 10...</p>
