Why do I have to complete a CAPTCHA?

   Completing the CAPTCHA proves you are a human and gives you temporary
   access to the web property.

What can I do to prevent this in the future?

   If you are on a personal connection, like at home, you can run an
   anti-virus scan on your device to make sure it is not infected with
   malware.

   If you are at an office or shared network, you can ask the network
   administrator to run a scan across the network looking for
   misconfigured or infected devices.
