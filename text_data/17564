   4 EFFECTIVE TIPS FOR GETTING BACK TO SPORT AFTER THE SUMMER

     *
     *

4 EFFECTIVE TIPS FOR GETTING BACK TO SPORT AFTER THE SUMMER

   After the summer, when the time comes to get back to sport, many of you
   don't know where to start or are quickly caught by the lack of time
   and/or motivation caused by your daily routine. With these fitness
   tips, we will guide you in gradually getting back in shape.

Tip n¬∞1: get back in the right order

   If your sports break lasted less than 15 days, start your sessions just
   as before, but slightly shorten your fitness sessions. Beyond 15 days,
   gradually restart your workouts, at least the first session, if not the
   next 2 sessions, and slowly increase over the following week until you
   reach your usual workout pace. Insist on a longer warm-up, longer
   stretches, and stay better hydrated (even when you're not thirsty!).


Tip n¬∞2: move at home

   If you're worried you don't have enough time to get to the gym or if a
   membership seems too expensive, why not get back in shape at home! How?
   By signing into domyos.com, in the Tips section, to discover our free
   exercise programmes.


Tip n¬∞3: create your workout wardrobe

   To get back in shape and motivate yourself to move, consider your
   equipment. Why not buy yourself a new fitness outfit? Another idea:
   consider getting yourself low-cost, effective body-sculpting
   accessories. Why not try out the AB220 to work on your abs, dumbbells
   to strengthen your arms, the Gymball to get a flat stomach back, or the
   Resistance Tube or Medicine Ball to tone your entire body?


Tip n¬∞4: take up healthy eating habits

   To get back to sport, you first need to organise your fridge so that
   you can find the key elements of a balanced diet, all in the right
   place.
     * High-quality proteins: beef, fish, eggs, chicken.
     * Low-starch vegetables: all vegetables except potatoes, peas, and
       corn.
     * Natural fats: avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, rapeseed oil.

   As much as you can, avoid simple sugars: doughnuts, cookies, sweets,
   chips, cakes, ice creams, (industrial) fruit juices, white bread, white
   pastas, white rice, sodas...


   These 4 sports tips will allow you to gradually get back in shape. Try
   to vary your activities so you never get bored. Plan a gentle restart
   schedule based on your physical condition, alternating with recovery
   time. Don't forget to get your beauty sleep to help you get back in
   shape!

Features

   Fitness shorts or running shorts: what's the difference?
   When doing fitness activities, you move in all directions. That means
   you need shorts that are long enough to keep you covered when you bend
   over or do movements like squats. When raising your legs or doing
   lunges, you need a stretchy, breathable fabric to follow your every
   move and provide good moisture management. All our products were
   designed to meet these needs which are different to running!
   The 360¬∞ concept: clothes that move with you!
   Of course! All our fabrics must successfully pass rigorous lab tests to
   ensure your comfort and safety. We test them for colourfastness,
   resistance to repeated washing, perspiration wicking and more - we call
   these our "torture tests". And after that? Is that it? Not quite. We
   then have sports users put our products through the ringer. We listen
   to and analyse their feedback to fix what needs to be improved. And
   only then is your sports clothing ready!
   What if I'm not satisfied with my product?
   You have 365 days to return your product to any DECATHLON store if it
   does not meet your expectations (although maybe not straight after a
   workout...). You can also try out products for 7 days for free (by
   preauthorising your debit/credit card which will then be charged after
   7 days) in order to be sure, when you make your purchase, you have the
   product you want!
