   Notre intervention au Bangladesh

   Despite economic indicators constantly progressing, about 31,5 per cent
   of the population is living under the threshold of poverty.

   Following massive population movements from the Rakhine State in
   Myanmar in August 2017, large numbers of Rohgingya and members of
   others ethnic minorities crossed the border with Bangladesh. Currently
   about one million people have taken shelter in the camps and villages
   in Cox’s Bazar. More than 40 per cent of the children are stunted, and
   the severe acute malnutrition rates are far above the emergency
   thresholds of WHO.

   The country is also one of the most vulnerable to climatic disasters.
   In May 2017, heavy rains and landslides caused by typhoon Mora affected
   more than nine million people.

   In 2017, we responded to three major emergencies: the Rohingya crisis,
   typhoon Mora, and heavy floods in the northwest regions. In partnership
   with several local and international organisations, we organised the
   prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition, as well as the support
   to vulnerable people in formal and informal camps, by direct
   interventions in nutrition and health, mental health and care
   practices, and water, sanitation and hygiene. In the region, we are
   also working outside of the camps.

   In parallel, our teams continued the activities of disaster risk
   reduction, strengthening the resilience of communities and authorities
   to face disasters, and supporting the authorities in the fight against
   acute undernutrition.

   Muk Kashim, aged 8, from Rammiya Bil, Moungdaw. Muk fled fighting in
   his village, with his mother, siblings and grandparents. Now, they live
   in Balukhali refugee camp. At an Action Against Hunger food
   distribution, Muk collected bags of biryani. Action Against Hunger have
   given the family food even day since they arrived in the camp one week
   ago, and provided the first meal they ate after they crossed the
   border. Muk said:“I fled with my mother. My father was killed by the
   military, they cut his throat. “I already had some food from [Action
   Against Hunger] this morning. So I am not hungry anymore. We didn’t
   have anything to eat when we were walking here. But I feel better
   now.“I couldn't bring anything from home. I had to leave everything
   behind. My home was burned down.”

   Our intervention in Afghanistan

   In 2018 the conflict further intensified, and Afghanistan was
   reclassified from a post-conflict country to one in active conflict.
   Civilians remain most affected. 278,000 Afghans had to flee their homes
   and 263,000 were displaced as a result of natural disasters.

   The 2018 drought affected more than two-thirds of Afghanistan and three
   million people, wrecking the agricultural sector.

   This year, 670,000 people returned from Iran and 43,000 from Pakistan.
   Access to care and psychological support remains one of the main needs,
   as well as food security, shelter, and access to water. In response, we
   have implemented multi-sectoral projects in nutrition and health,
   water, sanitation and hygiene, food security and livelihoods, as well
   as mental health and childcare practices. The Emergency Response
   Project (ERM) continued to meet the immediate and vital needs of those
   affected by ongoing armed conflict and regular natural disasters.
   Another emergency project targeted severe acute malnutrition.

   In Kabul, 48,881 people received nutritional support. In Ghor, our
   teams continued several multi-sectoral, integrated projects in support
   of health centres and close to communities to prevent maternal and
   infant mortality and morbidity. In Helmand, our integrated water,
   sanitation and hygiene and nutrition projects have cured 1,608 severely
   malnourished children and realised the
   distribution of 1,173 menstrual kits. In Badghis province, with the
   help of a local partner (AYSO), we launched an emergency response to
   help people affected by drought.

   Our intervention in Cameroon

   Cameroon is regularly affected by the socio-political unrest and
   fragility in the neighbouring countries of CAR, Chad and Nigeria.

   The country hosts about 275,000 Central African refugees and about
   102,000 Nigerian refugees, including 44,830 noncamp refugees. More than
   240,000 people are internally displaced in the Far North Region¹.
   Violence in English-speaking areas has led to population displacement
   and significant humanitarian needs. More than 220,000 people in
   Cameroon face food insecurity, primarily in the Far North Region2. The
   sanitary and nutritional situation is also critical. Displaced persons,
   as well as the most vulnerable in the host populations, are dependent
   on humanitarian aid.

   In the east of the country, we continued to work with CAR refugees and
   host communities to implement projects centering on empowerment, and
   strengthening their livelihoods. Our Maroua base in the Far North
   Region, opened in 2016, still supports all health centres in the
   Tokombere and Goulfey districts in order to improve the health system
   and primary health care. Support activities related to water,
   sanitation and hygiene have also improved access to safe water and
   reduced
   waterborne diseases.

   Since July 2017, we have been strengthening our response in the region
   through the resilience project. Implemented in collaboration with four
   other organisations, this four-year programme aims to strengthen the
   resilience and nutritional security of communities through actions
   focused on health and nutrition; water, sanitation and hygiene; food
   security; advocacy, and supporting local governance.

   Our intervention in Burkina Faso

   2018 was marked by a difficult security context, with the opening of
   new fronts of violence.

   More than 620,000 people have been directly affected by insecurity,
   490,000 of whom are in immediate need of nutritional, educational and
   health assistance after closures of schools and health centres. The
   nutritional situation is worrying, with global acute malnutrition rates
   of 8.4% and acute malnutrition rates of 1.6% among children aged
   between six and 59 months.¹ This Sahelian country is regularly hit by
   natural disasters with dramatic consequences for communities, which are
   increasingly vulnerable to seasonal shocks.

   In 2018, our teams continued their interventions, responding to both
   the structural challenges of the targeted areas and the nutritional
   insecurity resulting from a bad agricultural season. We focused on
   mitigating the consequences of nutritional insecurity through two
   measures: strengthening health systems, and advocating for the
   integration of nutrition into national development policies and
   budgets. To prevent the population from becoming even weaker after a
   prolonged period of nutritional insecurity, our teams boosted
   income-generating activities, encouraged people to diversify their
   livelihoods, increased awareness of good healthcare practices, and set
   up community-based programmes for access to drinking water and food. In
   the east of the country, a participatory and integrated approach to
   disaster preparedness and response has been launched among local
   elected officials, community leaders and civil society.

   Finally, the activities for disaster preparedness and adaptation to
   climate change proposed in the Soum and Tapoa provinces were completed
   by the end of 2018.

   Our intervention in Niger

   This year, the effects of the conflict in the north of Mali have been
   felt especially severely at the border with Niger, the poorest country
   in the world according to this year’s Human Development Index by the
   UN.

   This has resulted in a situation of instability, adding to the
   insecurity in the Diffa regions caused by the presence of Boko Haram.

   We have become established as a leading actor in the northern area of
   the Tahoua region, at the border with Mali, through a number of ongoing
   emergency interventions assisting the refugee and displaced population.
   Several early recovery interventions, which support the process from
   emergency to development, have also contributed to this position. We
   have likewise maintained an important presence in the Diffa region,
   with activities around economic and social recovery of the population
   of Lake Chad, and in Nguigmi. In this complex area of intervention
   where the conflict  ith Boko Haram is felt more acutely, we have worked
   to ensure that the health and nutrition needs of the resident and
   displaced population are being met.

   Notre intervention au Bangladesh

   Despite economic indicators constantly progressing, about 31,5 per cent
   of the population is living under the threshold of poverty.

   Following massive population movements from the Rakhine State in
   Myanmar in August 2017, large numbers of Rohgingya and members of
   others ethnic minorities crossed the border with Bangladesh. Currently
   about one million people have taken shelter in the camps and villages
   in Cox’s Bazar. More than 40 per cent of the children are stunted, and
   the severe acute malnutrition rates are far above the emergency
   thresholds of WHO.

   The country is also one of the most vulnerable to climatic disasters.
   In May 2017, heavy rains and landslides caused by typhoon Mora affected
   more than nine million people.

   In 2017, we responded to three major emergencies: the Rohingya crisis,
   typhoon Mora, and heavy floods in the northwest regions. In partnership
   with several local and international organisations, we organised the
   prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition, as well as the support
   to vulnerable people in formal and informal camps, by direct
   interventions in nutrition and health, mental health and care
   practices, and water, sanitation and hygiene. In the region, we are
   also working outside of the camps.

   In parallel, our teams continued the activities of disaster risk
   reduction, strengthening the resilience of communities and authorities
   to face disasters, and supporting the authorities in the fight against
   acute undernutrition.

   Muk Kashim, aged 8, from Rammiya Bil, Moungdaw. Muk fled fighting in
   his village, with his mother, siblings and grandparents. Now, they live
   in Balukhali refugee camp. At an Action Against Hunger food
   distribution, Muk collected bags of biryani. Action Against Hunger have
   given the family food even day since they arrived in the camp one week
   ago, and provided the first meal they ate after they crossed the
   border. Muk said:“I fled with my mother. My father was killed by the
   military, they cut his throat. “I already had some food from [Action
   Against Hunger] this morning. So I am not hungry anymore. We didn’t
   have anything to eat when we were walking here. But I feel better
   now.“I couldn't bring anything from home. I had to leave everything
   behind. My home was burned down.”

   Our intervention in Afghanistan

   In 2018 the conflict further intensified, and Afghanistan was
   reclassified from a post-conflict country to one in active conflict.
   Civilians remain most affected. 278,000 Afghans had to flee their homes
   and 263,000 were displaced as a result of natural disasters.

   The 2018 drought affected more than two-thirds of Afghanistan and three
   million people, wrecking the agricultural sector.

   This year, 670,000 people returned from Iran and 43,000 from Pakistan.
   Access to care and psychological support remains one of the main needs,
   as well as food security, shelter, and access to water. In response, we
   have implemented multi-sectoral projects in nutrition and health,
   water, sanitation and hygiene, food security and livelihoods, as well
   as mental health and childcare practices. The Emergency Response
   Project (ERM) continued to meet the immediate and vital needs of those
   affected by ongoing armed conflict and regular natural disasters.
   Another emergency project targeted severe acute malnutrition.

   In Kabul, 48,881 people received nutritional support. In Ghor, our
   teams continued several multi-sectoral, integrated projects in support
   of health centres and close to communities to prevent maternal and
   infant mortality and morbidity. In Helmand, our integrated water,
   sanitation and hygiene and nutrition projects have cured 1,608 severely
   malnourished children and realised the
   distribution of 1,173 menstrual kits. In Badghis province, with the
   help of a local partner (AYSO), we launched an emergency response to
   help people affected by drought.

   Our intervention in Cameroon

   Cameroon is regularly affected by the socio-political unrest and
   fragility in the neighbouring countries of CAR, Chad and Nigeria.

   The country hosts about 275,000 Central African refugees and about
   102,000 Nigerian refugees, including 44,830 noncamp refugees. More than
   240,000 people are internally displaced in the Far North Region¹.
   Violence in English-speaking areas has led to population displacement
   and significant humanitarian needs. More than 220,000 people in
   Cameroon face food insecurity, primarily in the Far North Region2. The
   sanitary and nutritional situation is also critical. Displaced persons,
   as well as the most vulnerable in the host populations, are dependent
   on humanitarian aid.

   In the east of the country, we continued to work with CAR refugees and
   host communities to implement projects centering on empowerment, and
   strengthening their livelihoods. Our Maroua base in the Far North
   Region, opened in 2016, still supports all health centres in the
   Tokombere and Goulfey districts in order to improve the health system
   and primary health care. Support activities related to water,
   sanitation and hygiene have also improved access to safe water and
   reduced
   waterborne diseases.

   Since July 2017, we have been strengthening our response in the region
   through the resilience project. Implemented in collaboration with four
   other organisations, this four-year programme aims to strengthen the
   resilience and nutritional security of communities through actions
   focused on health and nutrition; water, sanitation and hygiene; food
   security; advocacy, and supporting local governance.

   Our intervention in Burkina Faso

   2018 was marked by a difficult security context, with the opening of
   new fronts of violence.

   More than 620,000 people have been directly affected by insecurity,
   490,000 of whom are in immediate need of nutritional, educational and
   health assistance after closures of schools and health centres. The
   nutritional situation is worrying, with global acute malnutrition rates
   of 8.4% and acute malnutrition rates of 1.6% among children aged
   between six and 59 months.¹ This Sahelian country is regularly hit by
   natural disasters with dramatic consequences for communities, which are
   increasingly vulnerable to seasonal shocks.

   In 2018, our teams continued their interventions, responding to both
   the structural challenges of the targeted areas and the nutritional
   insecurity resulting from a bad agricultural season. We focused on
   mitigating the consequences of nutritional insecurity through two
   measures: strengthening health systems, and advocating for the
   integration of nutrition into national development policies and
   budgets. To prevent the population from becoming even weaker after a
   prolonged period of nutritional insecurity, our teams boosted
   income-generating activities, encouraged people to diversify their
   livelihoods, increased awareness of good healthcare practices, and set
   up community-based programmes for access to drinking water and food. In
   the east of the country, a participatory and integrated approach to
   disaster preparedness and response has been launched among local
   elected officials, community leaders and civil society.

   Finally, the activities for disaster preparedness and adaptation to
   climate change proposed in the Soum and Tapoa provinces were completed
   by the end of 2018.

   Our intervention in Niger

   This year, the effects of the conflict in the north of Mali have been
   felt especially severely at the border with Niger, the poorest country
   in the world according to this year’s Human Development Index by the
   UN.

   This has resulted in a situation of instability, adding to the
   insecurity in the Diffa regions caused by the presence of Boko Haram.

   We have become established as a leading actor in the northern area of
   the Tahoua region, at the border with Mali, through a number of ongoing
   emergency interventions assisting the refugee and displaced population.
   Several early recovery interventions, which support the process from
   emergency to development, have also contributed to this position. We
   have likewise maintained an important presence in the Diffa region,
   with activities around economic and social recovery of the population
   of Lake Chad, and in Nguigmi. In this complex area of intervention
   where the conflict  ith Boko Haram is felt more acutely, we have worked
   to ensure that the health and nutrition needs of the resident and
   displaced population are being met.

   Notre intervention au Mali

   In 2018 the situation in Mali was dominated by the presidential
   elections held between July and August.

   As in most of the countries of the Sahel, 2018 has been a year of
   crisis due to the shortage of pastures, which are fundamental to the
   livelihoods of most of the population, especially in the centre and
   north of the country. Likewise, the conflict in the north is already
   surpassing the borders of Niger and Burkina Faso. A solution or
   improvement of the situation is not expected any time soon.

   Despite the difficulties imposed on our operations by the security
   context, we have managed to  aintain a good level of access in our
   intervention areas this year.

   Our intervention in Somalia

   Somalia is experiencing a prolonged and complex crisis characterised by
   conflict, displacement, drought and disease. Malnutrition rates are
   high: nearly one million children under the age of five are estimated
   to be acutely malnourished in 2019, of whom 138,200 severely
   malnourished. Key drivers of malnutrition are food insecurity, lack of
   diverse diets, limited health services and inadequate access to water
   and sanitation.

   The influx of people to urban areas puts a strain on already limited
   resources, while displaced populations face considerable challenges.
   Mothers searching for work may be forced to leave children without
   proper care. Many people lack access to appropriate shelter and
   sanitation and hygiene facilities. In Somalia we contributed to the
   reduction of undernutrition and common illnesses among children in
   Bakool, Banadir and Nugaal, by providing integrated nutrition, health
   and food security services, as well as water, sanitation, and hygiene
   services.

   In 2018, 41,502 children under the age of five were admitted and
   treated for malnutrition, while 103,407 children were treated for minor
   illnesses. Furthermore, 45,734 pregnant and lactating women benefitted
   from training sessions. We reached 194,008 people with our water,
   sanitation, and hygiene programmes, including the rehabilitation and
   construction of 29 communal water sources, the construction of 324
   emergency latrines, and hygiene promotion activities.

   Our food security and livelihoods programmes benefitted 68,974
   individuals, helping them to build resilience. We provided cash to help
   families purchase food and other items, improved the animal health
   network system to help herding families maintain their livelihoods,
   modernised agricultural practices, and provided opportunities for
   community groups to increase their savings.

   Notre intervention au Liban

   The parliamentary elections in May represented a key moment for the
   country, since elections had not been held for nine years.

   This event coincided with the launch of a new electoral system, which
   partially changed the political leadership and, with it, certain
   attitudes towards the management of refugees. After eight years of
   conflict in Syria, refugee management continues to be one of the more
   pressing issues. This has a profound impact on the access to basic
   services and livelihoods, not only for the refugees themselves but also
   for the host population. The Lebanese Government estimates that the
   country hosts more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees, which is one of
   the largest concentrations of refugees per capita in the world. Nearly
   600,000 Syrian refugees have no recognised refugee status. As a result,
   these people do not have access to the different forms of assistance
   and support provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for
   Refugees (UNHCR) and other refugee assistance programmes.

   Our teams in the country are present both in the Bekaa region and in
   the south of the country including in difficult to reach areas, such as
   Arsal, Masharih al-Qaa and Cheeba, ensuring that basic assistance is
   provided to the populations. Our work here focuses on cash
   distributions through the KACHE system (Kit for Autonomous Cash
   Transfer in Humanitarian Emergencies) as well as continuing programmes
   in emergency aid, food security, water and sanitation, nutrition and
   protection.

   Challenge ACF - La défense 2018-5879 @remiglobetrotte

Paris La Défense

   DEPUIS 2008, PARIS LA DéFENSE ACCUEILLE LE CHALLENGE CONTRE LA FAIM,
   éVéNEMENT DE TEAM-BUILDING SOLIDAIRE ORGANISé PAR NOTRE ASSOCIATION.​


                         paris-la-defense-partenaire

   Paris La Défense est l’établissement public en charge de l’aménagement,
   de la gestion et de l’animation du quartier de La Défense. Cet
   établissement créé le 1er janvier 2018 a pour objectif de faire
   rayonner le quartier sur le plan national et international. Cet espace
   de vie accueille ainsi de nombreux événements sportifs et culturels.
   C’est notamment sur le parvis de La Défense qu’a lieu chaque année le
   Challenge contre la Faim, lancé à Paris en 2008.  ​

   Cet événement de team-building sportif et solidaire organisé par notre
   association mobilise chaque année plus de 100 entreprises et près de
   5000 participants.​

    ​
     __________________________________________________________________

A propos : ​​

   Paris La Défense est la plus grande destination économique, financière
   et commerciale d’Europe. C’est un territoire chargé d’histoire, créé il
   y a près de 60 ans, qui ne cesse de se renouveler et d’être
   redessiné. Grâce à un réseau de transports exceptionnel, le quartier
   d’affaires est situé à quelques minutes du centre historique de Paris.
   Il présente une offre immobilière de grande qualité, flexible, durable
   et en plein développement. Il fait également l’objet de programmes de
   rénovation et de valorisation urbaine ambitieux en vue de diversifier
   ses activités et de renforcer son attractivité. Offrant une haute
   qualité de vie et une gamme de services variée, c’est un territoire de
   performance et d’innovation, au service des entreprises et de leurs
   salariés. Lieu de rencontre et d’échange où se côtoient salariés,
   habitants, étudiants et visiteurs, il bénéficie depuis plusieurs années
   d’une politique événementielle et culturelle dynamique. C’est une
   destination loisirs du Grand Paris, avec notamment l’ouverture en
   septembre 2017 de Paris La Défense Arena, salle de spectacle pouvant
   accueillir jusqu’à 40 000 personnes et le toit de la Grande
   Arche. Paris La Défense abrite aussi le plus grand centre commercial
   d’Europe.​

Measuring African high burden countries’ progress towards the adoption of
national nutrition targets

   In 2012, the World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted a resolution which
   established six global targets to be achieved by 2025. In 2016,
   countries attending the Assembly reitarated their commitments and
   agreed to set national targets in line with national contexts in order
   to achieve greater progress towards global nutrition targets. The
   establishment of national targets can help set into motion a
   comprehensive planning process that identifies concrete actions and
   resources to effectively translate commitments into results.

   This scorecard highlights where high burden countries in Africa stand
   in the adoption of national nutrition targets. In general, the picture
   for African high-burden countries is mixed: more countries need to
   integrate national nutrition targets in their national policies or to
   improve them. Countries are progressing towards meeting the WHA global
   targets for stunting and for breastfeeding but progress towards
   reducing wasting remains dramatically insufficient in the continent
   concentrating the highest number of wasted children under five.
