       Marketing or Data Cloud to send you online advertising. This
       includes any personal information processed through the Oracle Data

       information about Oracle’s processing activities with regard to
       your personal information collected on Oracle websites and

   Oracle Corporation and Oracle America, Inc., having their registered
   address at 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood Shores, CA, 94065, USA, are
   responsible for processing your personal information in scope of this
   Privacy Policy.

4. WHICH TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE PROCESS AND FROM WHICH SOURCES?

   Oracle may process both offline and online information about you,
   including information from publicly available sources or third party
   data providers.
     * Offline information about you is obtained by Oracle from its
       offline partners such as brick-and-mortar retail stores, grocery
       stores and their associated loyalty card programs, payment card
       brands, catalog orders and consumer survey programs, and third
       parties who may not have a relationship with you and collect
       offline information from their offline partners.
     * Online information about you originates from your activities on
       sites operated by our online partners, such as advertising agencies
       and website operators (for example, online retail stores or travel
       sites). Oracle also obtains online information from third parties
       who may not have a relationship with you and who collect online
       information using cookies or similar technologies, such as pixels
       tags and device identifiers, as you browse the Internet and
       interact with websites. For more information on cookies and similar
       technologies used in connection with Oracle Data Cloud, please
       refer to Section 11 below.
       Our online Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud branded data partners are
       listed in our catalogue, which includes a comprehensive list of our
       current EU/EEA data suppliers. Please note that some of these
       partners only provide information about individuals in specific
       regions.

   Information about you may in some cases directly identify you, while in
   other cases it may only indirectly identify you. Personal information
   that is collected offline and that can directly identify you may
   include, for example:
     * name and physical address, email addresses, and telephone numbers;
     * demographic attributes, when tied to other information that
       identifies you;
     * transactional data based on your purchases, when tied to other
       information that identifies you;
     * company data such as the name, size and location of the company you
       work for and your role within the company;
     * data from marketing opt-in lists, consumer surveys, or publicly
       available information;
     * For the United States only: derived latitude/longitude from a
       physical address.

   Personal information that is collected online and that may indirectly
   identify you may include, for example:
     * unique IDs such as your mobile device identifier, or a cookie ID on
       your browser
     * a connected device identifier such as an ID from a smart television
       or streaming device (used for matching purposes in the US only);
     * IP addresses and information derived from IP addresses, such as
       geographic location;
     * information about your device, such as browser, device type,
       operating system, the presence or use of “apps”, screen resolution,
       or the preferred language;
     * obfuscated personal information such as hashed email addresses
       (direct identifiers are removed);
     * demographic information such as gender, age, and income range when
       not tied to information that directly identifies you;
     * behavioral data of the internet connected computer or device you
       use when interacting with websites, applications, or other
       connected devices, such as advertisements clicked or viewed,
       websites and content areas, date and time of these activities, or
       the web search used to locate and navigate to a website.

   We may associate personal information about you with interest segments
   or profiles as part of the provision of Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud
   services to our customers and partners:
     * Interest segments are a specific group of consumers that share a
       common behavior or preference used for direct marketing by our
       customers. For example: in market for travel specials to Hawaii.
     * Profiles are a set of attributes about a specific consumer or
       device, or a set of multiple consumers or devices sharing common
       attributes used for marketing by our customers. For example: age
       bracket 25-55; adventurous traveller; surfing enthusiast; in market
       for travel specials to Hawaii.

5. WHY AND HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

   We use personal information for the following purposes:
     * a) to help enable Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud customers and
       partners to market products and services to you based on your
       interests;
     * b) for personal information collected outside the EU/EEA, to
       analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and
       performance of Oracle products and services;
     * c) to manage the security of our sites, networks and systems;
     * d) to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate
       our business.

   These purposes are described below in further detail.
     * a) To help enable Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud customers and
       partners to market products and services to you based on your
       interests

   We process personal information about you to help enable Oracle
   Marketing & Data Cloud customers and partners to market products and
   services to you via online and offline marketing activities based on
   your interests.

   More specifically, Oracle can process information about you:
     * i. For online interest-based advertising delivered through Oracle
       Data Cloud partners that display online advertising to you on
       behalf of Oracle Data Cloud customers.
       Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company
       wants to market the company’s travel specials to Hawaii to a
       specific group of individuals (also known as an audience) that may
       be interested in those specials. The marketing professional uses
       Oracle Data Cloud to create an audience interested in travel to
       Hawaii. If you have visited a travel website previously and have
       expressed an interest in Hawaiian vacations, you may be placed in
       the travel company’s audience and subsequently see advertisements
       for a vacation to Hawaii on other websites (because a cookie has
       been placed on your browser) or, In the United States, via a
       connected device (due to an association between your IP address and
       device identifier).
     * ii. For offline and online campaign measurement, analytics, and
       development of insights on behalf of our Oracle Data Cloud
       customers.
       Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company
       wants to better understand if the company’s marketing campaign for
       travel specials to Hawaii contributed to an increase in their
       product sales. The marketing professional uses the Oracle Data
       Cloud to see how many display or videos ads were viewed, and
       whether the ads were clicked on and a purchase was made.
     * iii. For enabling our Oracle Data Cloud customers to personalize
       their products and services, including site optimization, email
       personalization and dynamic marketing and advertising optimization.
       Example: if you have previously indicated an interest in travel to
       Hawaii and when you visit a travel company’s website, the travel
       company can display tailored offers for Hawaiian vacations on their
       homepage.
     * iv. For linking Profiles and Interest Segments to enable Oracle
       Marketing & Data Cloud customers and partners to connect your
       Interest Segments across the various browsers and/or devices you
       may use for the purposes described in this section.
       Example: you are interested in vacations offered by a travel
       company and have clicked on their online advertising. You are
       logged into several devices (your desktop, smartphone, and tablet)
       using the same login. Oracle partners have indicated that you are
       likely the same user across those same devices. The travel company
       is able to display vacation offers to you (via a de-identified
       cookie ID) on these different devices
     * v. For creating modelled online and offline audiences for Oracle
       Data Cloud customers’ products and services.
       Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company
       wants to find new potential customers who are, like you, likely to
       be interested in travel to Hawaii. Oracle Data Cloud can help the
       travel company by looking for key characteristics between Profiles
       that have expressed an interest in traveling to Hawaii and other
       Profiles where a similar interest can be inferred based on these
       characteristics, such as an interest in travel to tropical islands.
     * vi. For enabling our Oracle Data Cloud customers to associate
       first-party information to certain Oracle Data Cloud identifiers in
       order to deliver marketing and advertising services to you.
       Example: A travel company has its own lists of customers who have
       purchased travel arrangements with them, with names, emails, and
       addresses. The travel company wants to be able to reach out to
       these customers with online advertising. The Oracle Data Cloud can
       help the travel company by converting the company’s own customer
       lists from identified names, emails and addresses, to de-identified
       groups of cookie and device ID’s provided by the Oracle Data Cloud,
       in a process known in the advertising industry as “onboarding”.
     * vii. For the United States only: to allow our customers to deliver
       catalogues to your physical address that may be of interest to you
       based on your previous purchase behavior.

     * b) For personal information collected outside the EU/EEA, to
       analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and
       performance of Oracle products and services
       We may process personal information for Oracle’s own research and
       development purposes.
       For example: to enhance data quality, develop new features and
       functionality, and for statistical analyses related to the
       performance and operation of the Oracle Marketing & Data Clouds.
     * c) to manage the security of our sites, networks and systems
       We can collect usage and systems operations data from the Oracle
       Marketing & Data Cloud for security and operations management to
       help keep our networks and systems as well as our products and
       services secure, or to investigate and prevent cyber-attacks or
       potential fraud, including ad fraud and to detect bots.
     * d) to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate
       our business
       In some cases, we may process personal information to comply with
       applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a
       request from a regulator or to defend a legal claim. We may also
       process personal information in the operation of our business. For
       example, to conduct audits and investigations, for finance and
       accounting, archiving and insurance purposes.

6. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT YOU COLLECTED IN THE EU/EEA, WHAT IS OUR LEGAL
BASIS?

   We rely on your consent for the purpose of enabling Oracle Marketing &
   Data Cloud customers and partners to market products and services to
   you, including measurement and analytics on campaign performance,
   personalization, modelling, onboarding, and linkage (see Section 5
   above for additional details on these purposes). Your consent is
   obtained on behalf of Oracle and its Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud
   customers and partners by our third party data providers.

   You have the right to withdraw your consent to this purpose at any
   time. Please refer to Section 12 below for more details on how to opt
   out of interest-based data processing based on your consent.

   In addition, we may process some information about you as may be
   necessary based on our legitimate interest to maintain the security of
   our sites, networks, and systems, and to comply with applicable laws
   and regulations, such as to process an opt-out request.

7. FOR WHAT PERIOD DO WE RETAIN INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?

   Oracle maintains information about you for the following retention
   periods:
     * a) Online information about you is retained for up to 13 months.
       Exceptionally and for online information collected outside the
       EU/EEA, online information may be retained up to 18 months, for
       example for Oracle customers’ seasonal or cyclical interest-based
       advertising campaigns or internal analytics and model development.
     * b) Online information about you for linkage purposes (cross
       device/cross-context technology) is retained for up to 12 months.
     * c) Offline information about you may be retained for up to 5 years
       if it was collected in the EU/EEA. We retain offline information
       about you in other regions as relevant for applicable purposes in
       those regions (also see Section 5 above).
     * d) Personal information necessary to preserve opt-out preferences
       is retained for 20 years, unless you delete it or otherwise prevent
       its collection as further described in Section 12 below.

8. WHEN AND HOW CAN WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

   Sharing within Oracle

   As a global organization, information about you can be shared globally
   throughout Oracle’s worldwide organization. See a list of Oracle
   entities. Please select a region and country to view the registered
   address and contact details of the Oracle entity or entities located in
   each country.

   Oracle employees are authorized to access personal information only to
   the extent necessary to serve the applicable purpose(s) and to perform
   their job functions.

   Sharing with third parties

   We may share personal information with the following third parties:
     * Oracle Data Cloud customers and partners, including digital
       marketers, ad agencies, web publishers, connected TV providers,
       demand side platforms, data management platforms, supply-side
       platforms and social media networks;
     * third-party service providers as necessary to perform Oracle
       Marketing & Data Cloud services on behalf of Oracle;
     * relevant third parties in the event of a reorganization, merger,
       sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of
       all or any portion of our business, assets or stock, including in
       connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings;
     * public and government authorities, including public and government
       authorities outside your country of residence (to the extent
       legally required to respond to their mandatory requests in
       connection with national security and/or law enforcement purposes).

   When third parties are given access to personal information, we will
   take appropriate contractual, technical and organizational measures
   designed to ensure that personal information is processed only to the
   extent that such processing is necessary, consistent with this Privacy
   Policy and in accordance with applicable law.

9. HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION HANDLED GLOBALLY?

   Oracle is a global corporation with operations in over 80 countries and
   personal information is processed globally. If personal information is
   transferred to an Oracle recipient in a country that does not provide
   an adequate level of protection for personal information, Oracle will
   take measures designed to adequately protect information about you,
   such as ensuring that such transfers are subject to the terms of the EU
   Model Clauses.

   Oracle also complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the
   Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department
   of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention when an Oracle
   Data Cloud customer and Oracle have agreed by contract that transfers
   of personal information from the European Economic Area ("EEA") or
   Switzerland will be transferred and processed pursuant to the Privacy
   Shield for the relevant services. When conducting those activities on
   behalf of its EEA or Swiss Oracle Data Cloud customers, Oracle holds
   and/or processes personal information provided by the EEA or Swiss
   customer at the direction of the customer. Oracle will then be
   responsible for ensuring that third parties acting as an agent on our
   behalf do the same. Oracle has certified to the Department of Commerce
   that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any
   conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy
   Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn
   more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification,
   please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.

   Please see the Privacy Shield website for the list of entities covered
   under Oracle’s Privacy Shield self-certification. With respect to
   personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy
   Shield Framework, Oracle is subject to the regulatory enforcement
   powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and commits to cooperate
   with EU data protection authorities.

10. HOW IS INFORMATION ABOUT YOU SECURED?

   Oracle has implemented appropriate technical, physical and
   organizational measures designed to protect personal information
   against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, damage,
   alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, as well as all other
   forms of unlawful processing.

11. WHAT COOKIES, PIXEL TAGS AND OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES DO WE USE?

   Cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels tags and device
   identifiers) are used by Oracle and our advertising technology partners
   to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off and across different
   services and devices for the purposes specified in Section 5 above.

   Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters and
   uniquely identify a browser on a connected device. We or our Oracle
   Marketing & Data Cloud partners may use cookies to, among other things,
   track user trends and collect information about how you use our
   customers’ sites or interact with advertising. Most browsers are
   initially configured to accept cookies by default. You may, however, be
   able to change your browser settings to cause your browser to refuse
   third-party cookies or to indicate when a third-party cookie is being
   sent. Check your browser’s “help” files to learn more about handling
   cookies.

   Pixel Tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) are invisible 1 x 1
   pixels that are placed on webpages that use this technology for
   marketing and measurement purposes. When you access these webpages,
   pixel tags generate a generic notice of the visit. Pixel tags can be
   used with cookies or alone. When used with cookies, pixel tags can
   track activity on a site by a particular device and provide relevant
   online advertising to you. When you turn off cookies or have opted out
   of cookies, pixel tags simply detect a unique website visit and how you
   interacted with the advertising but do not track an individual to
   provide relevant online advertising.

   You can opt out of cookies using the opt-out tools in the next section.

12. WHAT ARE YOUR CHOICES?

   We provide multiple choices in respect to the information we process
   about you. You can exercise these choices as described below.

   Opt-out and object to our use of information about you

   Oracle offers multiple ways for you to opt out and object to our use of
   information about you:
     * Oracle Data Cloud Opt out. Access the Oracle Data Cloud opt-out
       tool.
       Please note that if you use this opt-out tool, Oracle will opt you
       out of Oracle’s use of information about you for Oracle Data Cloud
       services involving both first-party use of your information as well
       as any third-party use of your information. See Section 2 above for
       more information on the distinction between first party and third
       party information.
       The Oracle Data Cloud opt out will prevent Oracle from delivering
       third-party audiences to connected devices such as smart
       televisions or streaming device; however, you can also visit your
       device’s settings menu or privacy policy for information on how to
       opt-out directly with your connected devices.
     * AdTech Industry Opt Out. You may also opt out of our processing of
       information about you for Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud services by
       using the opt-out tools provided by the following industry groups:
          + Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA):
            http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
          + Network Advertising Initiative (NAI):
            http://optout.networkadvertising.org
          + European Interactive Digital Adverting Alliance (EDAA):
            http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ and http://www.edaa.eu/
     * Mobile Opt Out. While the opt out methods described above often
       also work for mobile web browsing, mobile ‘app’ environments do not
       accept cookies. You may want to consider installing the AppChoices
       App provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) to exercise
       opt-out control for specific companies, including Oracle, when in a
       mobile app environment. See more information on how to download and
       configure the AppChoices App relevant for your mobile platform. You
       can also visit the NAI’s site for more information and instructions
       on opting out on mobile devices.
     * Do Not Track. Oracle honors “Do Not Track” browser settings,
       meaning we will not track your browser for marketing purposes while
       you have “Do Not Track” turned on in your browser settings.

   Please note that if you opt out using any of the first three opt out
   tools, you may still temporarily see interest-based advertising from
   Oracle Marketing & Data Clouds customers due to advertising campaigns
   from those customers already underway. However, you will be opted-out
   of all future advertising campaigns from customers that use the Oracle
   Marketing & Data Clouds.

   Also note that the first three opt out tools are currently cookie-based
   and prevent Oracle from using your personal information for
   interest-based advertising on the browser on which they are installed.
   As a result, these opt out tools will only function if your browser is
   set to accept third-party cookies and may not function where cookies
   are sometimes automatically disabled or removed (e.g., certain mobile
   devices and operating systems). If you delete cookies, change your
   browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another
   operating system, you will need to opt out again. Oracle does not use
   persistent, unique identifiers to revive a previously opted-out profile
   or deleted cookie.

   If you want to opt you out of Oracle’s use of information about you for
   Oracle Data Cloud services, but do not want to receive third-party
   cookies, you can also change your browser settings on your computer or
   other device you are using to connect to the internet. Most browsers
   also provide functionality that lets you opt out of all advertising
   cookies, including Oracle cookies.

   Delete information about you

   You can erase or delete all online information about you by opting out
   of Oracle Data Cloud services using the Oracle Data Cloud opt-out tool
   above.

   If you would like to submit a request to have offline information about
   you, if any, erased or deleted, you can use this form.

   Access information about you

   In order to exercise your right to access your online information
   stored in the Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud, you can use the Oracle
   Data Cloud Registry (‘Registry’) to view the online segments Oracle has
   associated with your device. By accessing this Registry, you can view
   the types of third-party interest segments that are available for
   Oracle Data Cloud customers. Please note that the interest segments you
   see within the Registry is information from the profile associated with
   the specific browser, computer or device that you are using to visit
   the Registry. You may see different segments when viewing the Registry
   from a different browser, computer or device. For a complete picture of
   the segments associated with all of your browsers and devices, we
   therefore recommend using these different browsers and devices when
   accessing the Registry.

   For a copy of your offline information, please contact the Oracle
   Global Data Protection Officer as set out in Section 16 below. While
   the majority of offline access requests can be handled quickly, complex
   requests may take more research and time. In such cases, you will be
   contacted regarding the nature of the request and appropriate next
   steps within one month from the date of receipt of your request. We
   cannot provide offline first-party information that is collected and
   maintained by our customers. If you have questions in regards to
   first-party information, Oracle recommends that you contact directly
   the company that collected it from you.

13. DOES THE ORACLE DATA CLOUD COLLECT SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION?

   Oracle does not create any online interest segments that reflect
   personal information that we consider sensitive. While the types of
   personal information considered sensitive may vary among consumers and
   applicable law, we treat the following types of personal information as
   sensitive:
     * precise health information, such as a consumer having a certain
       medical condition like cancer or diabetes. View the current list
       (PDF) of third-party health and wellness interest segments
       available in the Oracle Data Cloud for the US. Note that some of
       these segments are not available in certain jurisdictions, such as
       the EU/EEA;
     * certain aspects of a consumer’s personal life or financial
       situation;
     * interest in "adult" products or services;
     * information considered sensitive based on applicable law, such as
       special categories of data if you are in the EU/EEA.

   We do not allow Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud customers or partners to
   use the Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud services for employment, credit,
   healthcare, or insurance eligibility purposes.

14. DOES THE ORACLE DATA CLOUD COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN?

   We do not intentionally collect personal information from, and do not
   tailor any services to, children under 16 years of age. Further, we
   prohibit our Oracle Data Cloud partners from providing Oracle with
   personal information from sites directed to children under the age of
   16 or from consumers whose age these companies know to be under the age
   of 16.

15. IS ORACLE A MEMBER OF ANY INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS?

   Oracle is a member of, and adheres to, the self-regulatory principles
   of the following industry organizations:
     * the Data Marketing & Analytics (DMA)
     * the Direct Marketing Association UK (DMA UK);
     * the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI);
     * the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB);
     * the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA);
     * the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC); and
     * the European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA).

   As a member of these organizations, Oracle works with industry-leading
   companies to address important privacy and consumer protection issues
   in offline direct marketing and online advertising.

   The NAI has created a compliance program that incorporates attestation
   reviews, a consumer complaint process, sanctions and annual reporting
   to help ensure that member companies keep their promises to you and
   abide by the NAI’s Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct.

16. HOW TO CONTACT ORACLE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, COMMENTS OR COMPLAINTS?

   Oracle has appointed a Global Data Protection Officer. If you believe
   your personal information has been used in a way that is not consistent
   with the Privacy Policy or your choices, or if you have further
   questions, comments or suggestions related to this Privacy Policy, or
   if you wish to exercise your right to access to your offline personal
   information as described in Section 12 above, please contact the Global
   Data Protection Officer by filling out an inquiry form.

   Written inquiries to the Data Protection Officer may be addressed to:

17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION OR FILING A COMPLAINT

   If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with this Privacy
   Policy, please contact us first. We will investigate and attempt to
   resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of
   personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in
   accordance with applicable law.

   we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based
   third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at

Oracle Data Cloud Privacy Policy

1. INTRODUCTION

   This Oracle Data Cloud Privacy Policy (also referred to as the ‘Privacy
   Policy’ or the ‘Marketing Cloud & Oracle Data Cloud Privacy Policy’)
   informs consumers (‘you’) on the collection, use and sharing
   (collectively referred to as ‘processing’) of your personal information
   in connection with Oracle’s provision of marketing cloud and data cloud
   services designed to help Oracle’s customers’ and partners’ online and
   offline marketing activities (‘Oracle Marketing & Data Clouds’). This
   Privacy Policy also explains the choices you have in relation to these
   processing activities.

   This Privacy Policy was last updated on July 26, 2019. However, the
   Privacy Policy can change over time, for example to comply with legal
   requirements or to meet changing business needs. The most up-to-date
   version can be found on this website. In case there is an important
   change that we want to highlight to you, we will also inform you in
   another appropriate way (for example, via a pop-up notice or statement
   of changes on our website). View a previous version of this Privacy
   Policy.

   As used in this Privacy Policy, ‘personal information’ or ‘personal
   data’ means information that relates to an identified individual or to
   an identifiable individual. For example, this could include among other
   things your name, address, email address, past purchase behavior or
   information regarding your online interests. Personal information about
   you that Oracle may process is also referred to as ‘information about
   you.’ For more detail about the types of information about you that we
   may process in the Oracle Marketing & Data Clouds, please refer to
   Section 4 below.

       sites operated by our online partners, such as advertising agencies
       and website operators (for example, online retail stores or travel
       sites). Oracle also obtains online information from third parties
       who may not have a relationship with you and who collect online
       information using cookies or similar technologies, such as pixels
       tags and device identifiers, as you browse the Internet and
       interact with websites. For more information on cookies and similar
       technologies used in connection with Oracle Data Cloud, please
       refer to Section 11 below.
       Our online Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud branded data partners are
       listed in our catalogue, which includes a comprehensive list of our
       current EU/EEA data suppliers. Please note that some of these
       partners only provide information about individuals in specific
       regions.

   Information about you may in some cases directly identify you, while in
   other cases it may only indirectly identify you. Personal information
   that is collected offline and that can directly identify you may
   include, for example:
     * name and physical address, email addresses, and telephone numbers;
     * demographic attributes, when tied to other information that
       identifies you;
     * transactional data based on your purchases, when tied to other
       information that identifies you;
     * company data such as the name, size and location of the company you
       work for and your role within the company;
     * data from marketing opt-in lists, consumer surveys, or publicly
       available information;
     * For the United States only: derived latitude/longitude from a
       physical address.

   Personal information that is collected online and that may indirectly
   identify you may include, for example:
     * unique IDs such as your mobile device identifier, or a cookie ID on
       your browser
     * a connected device identifier such as an ID from a smart television
       or streaming device (used for matching purposes in the US only);
     * IP addresses and information derived from IP addresses, such as
       geographic location;
     * information about your device, such as browser, device type,
       operating system, the presence or use of “apps”, screen resolution,
       or the preferred language;
     * obfuscated personal information such as hashed email addresses
       (direct identifiers are removed);
     * demographic information such as gender, age, and income range when
       not tied to information that directly identifies you;
     * behavioral data of the internet connected computer or device you
       use when interacting with websites, applications, or other
       connected devices, such as advertisements clicked or viewed,
       websites and content areas, date and time of these activities, or
       the web search used to locate and navigate to a website.

   We may associate personal information about you with interest segments
   or profiles as part of the provision of Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud
   services to our customers and partners:
     * Interest segments are a specific group of consumers that share a
       common behavior or preference used for direct marketing by our
       customers. For example: in market for travel specials to Hawaii.
     * Profiles are a set of attributes about a specific consumer or
       device, or a set of multiple consumers or devices sharing common
       attributes used for marketing by our customers. For example: age
       bracket 25-55; adventurous traveller; surfing enthusiast; in market
       for travel specials to Hawaii.

5. WHY AND HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

   We use personal information for the following purposes:
     * a) to help enable Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud customers and
       partners to market products and services to you based on your
       interests;
     * b) for personal information collected outside the EU/EEA, to
       analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and
       performance of Oracle products and services;
     * c) to manage the security of our sites, networks and systems;
     * d) to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate
       our business.

   These purposes are described below in further detail.
     * a) To help enable Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud customers and
       partners to market products and services to you based on your
       interests

   We process personal information about you to help enable Oracle
   Marketing & Data Cloud customers and partners to market products and
   services to you via online and offline marketing activities based on
   your interests.

   More specifically, Oracle can process information about you:
     * i. For online interest-based advertising delivered through Oracle
       Data Cloud partners that display online advertising to you on
       behalf of Oracle Data Cloud customers.
       Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company
       wants to market the company’s travel specials to Hawaii to a
       specific group of individuals (also known as an audience) that may
       be interested in those specials. The marketing professional uses
       Oracle Data Cloud to create an audience interested in travel to
       Hawaii. If you have visited a travel website previously and have
       expressed an interest in Hawaiian vacations, you may be placed in
       the travel company’s audience and subsequently see advertisements
       for a vacation to Hawaii on other websites (because a cookie has
       been placed on your browser) or, In the United States, via a
       connected device (due to an association between your IP address and
       device identifier).
     * ii. For offline and online campaign measurement, analytics, and
       development of insights on behalf of our Oracle Data Cloud
       customers.
       Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company
       wants to better understand if the company’s marketing campaign for
       travel specials to Hawaii contributed to an increase in their
       product sales. The marketing professional uses the Oracle Data
       Cloud to see how many display or videos ads were viewed, and
       whether the ads were clicked on and a purchase was made.
     * iii. For enabling our Oracle Data Cloud customers to personalize
       their products and services, including site optimization, email
       personalization and dynamic marketing and advertising optimization.
       Example: if you have previously indicated an interest in travel to
       Hawaii and when you visit a travel company’s website, the travel
       company can display tailored offers for Hawaiian vacations on their
       homepage.
     * iv. For linking Profiles and Interest Segments to enable Oracle
       Marketing & Data Cloud customers and partners to connect your
       Interest Segments across the various browsers and/or devices you
       may use for the purposes described in this section.
       Example: you are interested in vacations offered by a travel
       company and have clicked on their online advertising. You are
       logged into several devices (your desktop, smartphone, and tablet)
       using the same login. Oracle partners have indicated that you are
       likely the same user across those same devices. The travel company
       is able to display vacation offers to you (via a de-identified
       cookie ID) on these different devices
     * v. For creating modelled online and offline audiences for Oracle
       Data Cloud customers’ products and services.
       Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company
       wants to find new potential customers who are, like you, likely to
       be interested in travel to Hawaii. Oracle Data Cloud can help the
       travel company by looking for key characteristics between Profiles
       that have expressed an interest in traveling to Hawaii and other
       Profiles where a similar interest can be inferred based on these
       characteristics, such as an interest in travel to tropical islands.
     * vi. For enabling our Oracle Data Cloud customers to associate
       first-party information to certain Oracle Data Cloud identifiers in
       order to deliver marketing and advertising services to you.
       Example: A travel company has its own lists of customers who have
       purchased travel arrangements with them, with names, emails, and
       addresses. The travel company wants to be able to reach out to
       these customers with online advertising. The Oracle Data Cloud can
       help the travel company by converting the company’s own customer
       lists from identified names, emails and addresses, to de-identified
       groups of cookie and device ID’s provided by the Oracle Data Cloud,
       in a process known in the advertising industry as “onboarding”.
     * vii. For the United States only: to allow our customers to deliver
       catalogues to your physical address that may be of interest to you
       based on your previous purchase behavior.

     * b) For personal information collected outside the EU/EEA, to
       analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and
       performance of Oracle products and services
       We may process personal information for Oracle’s own research and
       development purposes.
       For example: to enhance data quality, develop new features and
       functionality, and for statistical analyses related to the
       performance and operation of the Oracle Marketing & Data Clouds.
     * c) to manage the security of our sites, networks and systems
       We can collect usage and systems operations data from the Oracle
       Marketing & Data Cloud for security and operations management to
       help keep our networks and systems as well as our products and
       services secure, or to investigate and prevent cyber-attacks or
       potential fraud, including ad fraud and to detect bots.
     * d) to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate
       our business
       In some cases, we may process personal information to comply with
       applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a
       request from a regulator or to defend a legal claim. We may also
       process personal information in the operation of our business. For
       example, to conduct audits and investigations, for finance and
       accounting, archiving and insurance purposes.

6. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT YOU COLLECTED IN THE EU/EEA, WHAT IS OUR LEGAL
BASIS?

   We rely on your consent for the purpose of enabling Oracle Marketing &
   Data Cloud customers and partners to market products and services to
   you, including measurement and analytics on campaign performance,
   personalization, modelling, onboarding, and linkage (see Section 5
   above for additional details on these purposes). Your consent is
   obtained on behalf of Oracle and its Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud
   customers and partners by our third party data providers.

   You have the right to withdraw your consent to this purpose at any
   time. Please refer to Section 12 below for more details on how to opt
   out of interest-based data processing based on your consent.

   In addition, we may process some information about you as may be
   necessary based on our legitimate interest to maintain the security of
   our sites, networks, and systems, and to comply with applicable laws
   and regulations, such as to process an opt-out request.

7. FOR WHAT PERIOD DO WE RETAIN INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?

   Oracle maintains information about you for the following retention
   periods:
     * a) Online information about you is retained for up to 13 months.
       Exceptionally and for online information collected outside the
       EU/EEA, online information may be retained up to 18 months, for
       example for Oracle customers’ seasonal or cyclical interest-based
       advertising campaigns or internal analytics and model development.
     * b) Online information about you for linkage purposes (cross
       device/cross-context technology) is retained for up to 12 months.
     * c) Offline information about you may be retained for up to 5 years
       if it was collected in the EU/EEA. We retain offline information
       about you in other regions as relevant for applicable purposes in
       those regions (also see Section 5 above).
     * d) Personal information necessary to preserve opt-out preferences
       is retained for 20 years, unless you delete it or otherwise prevent
       its collection as further described in Section 12 below.

8. WHEN AND HOW CAN WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

   Sharing within Oracle

   As a global organization, information about you can be shared globally
   throughout Oracle’s worldwide organization. See a list of Oracle
   entities. Please select a region and country to view the registered
   address and contact details of the Oracle entity or entities located in
   each country.

   Oracle employees are authorized to access personal information only to
   the extent necessary to serve the applicable purpose(s) and to perform
   their job functions.

   Sharing with third parties

   We may share personal information with the following third parties:
     * Oracle Data Cloud customers and partners, including digital
       marketers, ad agencies, web publishers, connected TV providers,
       demand side platforms, data management platforms, supply-side
       platforms and social media networks;
     * third-party service providers as necessary to perform Oracle
       Marketing & Data Cloud services on behalf of Oracle;
     * relevant third parties in the event of a reorganization, merger,
       sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of
       all or any portion of our business, assets or stock, including in
       connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings;
     * public and government authorities, including public and government
       authorities outside your country of residence (to the extent
       legally required to respond to their mandatory requests in

   When third parties are given access to personal information, we will
   take appropriate contractual, technical and organizational measures
   designed to ensure that personal information is processed only to the
   extent that such processing is necessary, consistent with this Privacy
   Policy and in accordance with applicable law.

9. HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION HANDLED GLOBALLY?

   Oracle is a global corporation with operations in over 80 countries and
   personal information is processed globally. If personal information is
   transferred to an Oracle recipient in a country that does not provide
   an adequate level of protection for personal information, Oracle will
   take measures designed to adequately protect information about you,
   such as ensuring that such transfers are subject to the terms of the EU
   Model Clauses.

   Oracle also complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the
   Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department
   of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention when an Oracle
   Data Cloud customer and Oracle have agreed by contract that transfers
   of personal information from the European Economic Area ("EEA") or
   Switzerland will be transferred and processed pursuant to the Privacy
   Shield for the relevant services. When conducting those activities on
   behalf of its EEA or Swiss Oracle Data Cloud customers, Oracle holds
   and/or processes personal information provided by the EEA or Swiss
   customer at the direction of the customer. Oracle will then be
   responsible for ensuring that third parties acting as an agent on our
   behalf do the same. Oracle has certified to the Department of Commerce
   that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any
   conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy
   Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn
   more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification,
   please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.

   Please see the Privacy Shield website for the list of entities covered
   under Oracle’s Privacy Shield self-certification. With respect to
   personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy
   Shield Framework, Oracle is subject to the regulatory enforcement
   powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and commits to cooperate
   with EU data protection authorities.

10. HOW IS INFORMATION ABOUT YOU SECURED?

   Oracle has implemented appropriate technical, physical and
   organizational measures designed to protect personal information
   against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, damage,
   alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, as well as all other
   forms of unlawful processing.

11. WHAT COOKIES, PIXEL TAGS AND OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES DO WE USE?

   Cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels tags and device
   identifiers) are used by Oracle and our advertising technology partners
   to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off and across different
   services and devices for the purposes specified in Section 5 above.

   Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters and
   uniquely identify a browser on a connected device. We or our Oracle
   Marketing & Data Cloud partners may use cookies to, among other things,
   track user trends and collect information about how you use our
   customers’ sites or interact with advertising. Most browsers are
   initially configured to accept cookies by default. You may, however, be
   able to change your browser settings to cause your browser to refuse
   third-party cookies or to indicate when a third-party cookie is being
   sent. Check your browser’s “help” files to learn more about handling
   cookies.

   Pixel Tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) are invisible 1 x 1
   pixels that are placed on webpages that use this technology for
   marketing and measurement purposes. When you access these webpages,
   pixel tags generate a generic notice of the visit. Pixel tags can be
   used with cookies or alone. When used with cookies, pixel tags can
   track activity on a site by a particular device and provide relevant
   online advertising to you. When you turn off cookies or have opted out
   of cookies, pixel tags simply detect a unique website visit and how you
   interacted with the advertising but do not track an individual to
   provide relevant online advertising.

   You can opt out of cookies using the opt-out tools in the next section.

12. WHAT ARE YOUR CHOICES?

   We provide multiple choices in respect to the information we process
   about you. You can exercise these choices as described below.

   Opt-out and object to our use of information about you

   Oracle offers multiple ways for you to opt out and object to our use of
   information about you:
     * Oracle Data Cloud Opt out. Access the Oracle Data Cloud opt-out
       tool.
       Please note that if you use this opt-out tool, Oracle will opt you
       out of Oracle’s use of information about you for Oracle Data Cloud
       services involving both first-party use of your information as well
       as any third-party use of your information. See Section 2 above for
       more information on the distinction between first party and third
       party information.
       The Oracle Data Cloud opt out will prevent Oracle from delivering
       third-party audiences to connected devices such as smart
       televisions or streaming device; however, you can also visit your
       device’s settings menu or privacy policy for information on how to
       opt-out directly with your connected devices.
     * AdTech Industry Opt Out. You may also opt out of our processing of
       information about you for Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud services by
       using the opt-out tools provided by the following industry groups:
          + Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA):
            http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
          + Network Advertising Initiative (NAI):
            http://optout.networkadvertising.org
          + European Interactive Digital Adverting Alliance (EDAA):
            http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ and http://www.edaa.eu/
     * Mobile Opt Out. While the opt out methods described above often
       also work for mobile web browsing, mobile ‘app’ environments do not
       accept cookies. You may want to consider installing the AppChoices
       App provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) to exercise
       opt-out control for specific companies, including Oracle, when in a
       mobile app environment. See more information on how to download and
       configure the AppChoices App relevant for your mobile platform. You
       can also visit the NAI’s site for more information and instructions
       on opting out on mobile devices.
     * Do Not Track. Oracle honors “Do Not Track” browser settings,
       meaning we will not track your browser for marketing purposes while
       you have “Do Not Track” turned on in your browser settings.

   Please note that if you opt out using any of the first three opt out
   tools, you may still temporarily see interest-based advertising from
   Oracle Marketing & Data Clouds customers due to advertising campaigns
   from those customers already underway. However, you will be opted-out
   of all future advertising campaigns from customers that use the Oracle
   Marketing & Data Clouds.

   Also note that the first three opt out tools are currently cookie-based
   and prevent Oracle from using your personal information for
   interest-based advertising on the browser on which they are installed.
   As a result, these opt out tools will only function if your browser is
   set to accept third-party cookies and may not function where cookies
   are sometimes automatically disabled or removed (e.g., certain mobile
   devices and operating systems). If you delete cookies, change your
   browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another
   operating system, you will need to opt out again. Oracle does not use
   persistent, unique identifiers to revive a previously opted-out profile
   or deleted cookie.

   If you want to opt you out of Oracle’s use of information about you for
   Oracle Data Cloud services, but do not want to receive third-party
   cookies, you can also change your browser settings on your computer or
   other device you are using to connect to the internet. Most browsers
   also provide functionality that lets you opt out of all advertising
   cookies, including Oracle cookies.

   Delete information about you

   You can erase or delete all online information about you by opting out
   of Oracle Data Cloud services using the Oracle Data Cloud opt-out tool
   above.

   If you would like to submit a request to have offline information about
   you, if any, erased or deleted, you can use this form.

   Access information about you

   In order to exercise your right to access your online information
   stored in the Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud, you can use the Oracle
   Data Cloud Registry (‘Registry’) to view the online segments Oracle has
   associated with your device. By accessing this Registry, you can view
   the types of third-party interest segments that are available for
   Oracle Data Cloud customers. Please note that the interest segments you
   see within the Registry is information from the profile associated with
   the specific browser, computer or device that you are using to visit
   the Registry. You may see different segments when viewing the Registry
   from a different browser, computer or device. For a complete picture of
   the segments associated with all of your browsers and devices, we
   therefore recommend using these different browsers and devices when
   accessing the Registry.

   For a copy of your offline information, please contact the Oracle
   Global Data Protection Officer as set out in Section 16 below. While
   the majority of offline access requests can be handled quickly, complex
   requests may take more research and time. In such cases, you will be
   contacted regarding the nature of the request and appropriate next
   steps within one month from the date of receipt of your request. We
   cannot provide offline first-party information that is collected and
   maintained by our customers. If you have questions in regards to
   first-party information, Oracle recommends that you contact directly
   the company that collected it from you.

13. DOES THE ORACLE DATA CLOUD COLLECT SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION?

   Oracle does not create any online interest segments that reflect
   personal information that we consider sensitive. While the types of
   personal information considered sensitive may vary among consumers and
   applicable law, we treat the following types of personal information as
   sensitive:
     * precise health information, such as a consumer having a certain
       medical condition like cancer or diabetes. View the current list
       (PDF) of third-party health and wellness interest segments
       available in the Oracle Data Cloud for the US. Note that some of
       these segments are not available in certain jurisdictions, such as
       the EU/EEA;
     * certain aspects of a consumer’s personal life or financial
       situation;
     * interest in "adult" products or services;
     * information considered sensitive based on applicable law, such as
       special categories of data if you are in the EU/EEA.

   We do not allow Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud customers or partners to
   use the Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud services for employment, credit,
   healthcare, or insurance eligibility purposes.

14. DOES THE ORACLE DATA CLOUD COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN?

   We do not intentionally collect personal information from, and do not
   tailor any services to, children under 16 years of age. Further, we
   prohibit our Oracle Data Cloud partners from providing Oracle with
   personal information from sites directed to children under the age of
   16 or from consumers whose age these companies know to be under the age
   of 16.

15. IS ORACLE A MEMBER OF ANY INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS?

   Oracle is a member of, and adheres to, the self-regulatory principles
   of the following industry organizations:
     * the Data Marketing & Analytics (DMA)
     * the Direct Marketing Association UK (DMA UK);
     * the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI);
     * the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB);
     * the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA);
     * the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC); and

   As a member of these organizations, Oracle works with industry-leading
   companies to address important privacy and consumer protection issues
   in offline direct marketing and online advertising.

   The NAI has created a compliance program that incorporates attestation
   reviews, a consumer complaint process, sanctions and annual reporting
   to help ensure that member companies keep their promises to you and
   abide by the NAI’s Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct.
