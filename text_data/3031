   The British Council is the United Kingdom’s international organisation
   for cultural relations and educational opportunities.

   We believe that child protection requires everyone to take
   responsibility and that every child matters. We recognise that the
   care, protection and welfare of children is paramount and that all
   children have the right to be protected from all types of harm.  We
   also recognise that we have a fundamental duty of care towards all
   children where our programmes and operations facilitate contact with
   children, or have an impact on children. This includes a duty to
   protect children from harm or risk of harm as a result of:
     * misconduct by our staff or partners
     * poor practice
     * the poor design or delivery of our programmes and operations.

   We aim to achieve this through compliance with UK child protection laws
   and the relevant laws in each of the countries where we operate and by
   adhering to Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights
   of the Child (UNCRC) 1989.

   A child is defined in the British Council as anyone who has not reached
   their 18th birthday (UNCRC 1989) irrespective of the age of majority in
   the country where the child is, or in their home country.

   The British Council is committed to:
     * valuing, respecting and listening to children
     * ensuring all necessary checks are made when recruiting staff
     * maintaining strong child protection systems and procedures for
       staff
     * training its staff and providing a common understanding of child
       protection issues to inform planning and practice
     * sharing information about child protection and good practice with
       children and parents/carers
     * sharing information about any concerns with the relevant agencies
       and involving parents and children appropriately
     * providing effective management for staff through clear processes,
       supervision and support.

   We will provide adequate and appropriate resources to implement this
   policy and will ensure it is communicated and understood.

   The British Council will review this global policy statement annually
   to reflect new legal and regulatory developments and ensure good
   practice.

   This global policy statement was approved by Sir Ciarán Devane, Chief
   Executive, in March 2019 and is due for review in March 2020.

8. Who owns the content published on British Council Digital Services?

   The British Council is the owner or the licensee of all intellectual

   Digital Services.

   British Council Content may sometimes include content which is owned or
   controlled by another person or organisation but which the British
   Council has a licence to make available to you through the relevant

   the GNU General Public License for digital services provided through
   Moodle.

9. What should I be aware of when using British Council Content?

Does British Council Content always reflect the view of the British Council?

   No.  The British Council encourages freedom of expression, but the

Will British Council Content always be accurate?

   Although every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that British
   Council Content (and all other information on British Council Digital

   prior written approval, including:
     * commercial purposes except as expressly stated by the British

Some British Council Digital Services enable you to share Your Content with
us and with other users of British Council Digital Services.

   When we refer to ‘Your Content’ we mean any content created, developed
   or in any way added on or to British Council Digital Services by you or
   through your password-protected account.  For example, Your Content
   might include comments, articles, photographs, graphics, audios,

   Please do not endanger yourself or others, take any unnecessary risks
   or break any laws when creating Your Content or uploading Your Content
   to British Council Digital Services.

12. What should I be aware of when I contribute my own content to British
Council Digital Services?

Will my contribution to British Council Digital Services always be
acknowledged?

   We normally show your name with your contribution, unless you request
   otherwise, but for operational reasons this is not always possible.

Will the British Council moderate my contribution to British Council Digital
Services?

   Some British Council Digital Services are moderated to check that Your
   Content is consistent with these Terms of Use.  We will always try to
   publish Your Content as soon as reasonably practicable but we cannot
   guarantee that content you submit for publication through British
   Council Digital Services will always be published.

   The British Council reserves the right to remove any of Your Content
   from British Council Digital Services if we believe that it does not
   comply with these Terms of Use.

Will I continue to own content I contribute to British Council Digital
Services?

   Provided that Your Content is your original work, you will continue to
   own Your Content and copyright in Your Content will remain with you.
   The rights granted to the British Council to make use of Your Content
   are not exclusive, so you can continue to use the material in any way,
   including allowing others to use Your Content.

   By uploading or otherwise adding Your Content to any British Council
   Digital Services, you confirm that all Your Content is your original
   work, is not defamatory, does not infringe any laws and that you have
   the consent of anyone who is identifiable in Your Content (or the
   consent of their parent/guardian if they are under 18).

What can the British Council do with my content?

   By uploading or otherwise adding Your Content to any British Council
   Digital Services, you grant to the British Council, free of charge,
   permission to use Your Content (including modifying and adapting it for
   operational and editorial reasons) in any media worldwide for the
   purposes explained in the relevant British Council Digital Service and
   for encouraging networking and wider conversation about educational
   opportunities and cultural relations. If you do not want the British
   Council to make use of Your Content, please do not upload or otherwise
   add any content to British Council Digital Services.

   You are advised to keep a copy of all Your Content because the British
   Council cannot guarantee to return a copy of Your Content to you at any
   time.

13. Will British Council Digital Services always be available?

We use our reasonable endeavours to ensure British Council Digital Services
are available to you.

   However, owing to the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee that
   British Council Digital Services or the websites to which they are
   linked will be available to you.  You should ensure that you have
   appropriate protection against viruses and other malware and other
   security arrangements in place whilst using the internet.

   British Council Content is selected, edited, updated and made available
   to all users by the British Council through British Council Digital
   Services at our sole discretion.  This means that we can remove British
   Council Content from a British Council Digital Service at any time.

   We have agreements with third parties that own or control parts of
   British Council Content, and these agreements permit them to make the
   content available through British Council Digital Services.  As a
   result of these agreements, the period of time during which the user
   may access, view and/or listen to British Council Content using British
   Council Digital Services may vary.

14. What terms apply to links to websites that are operated by other people
or organisations?

What links are included from British Council Digital Services?

   British Council Digital Services contain links to other websites on the
   Internet that are operated by other people or organisations (‘Third
   Party Sites’). These Third Party Sites may have their own terms of use,
   so you will need to be aware of these.

   We have no responsibility under these Terms of Use for the accuracy,
   copyright compliance, legality, decency, or any other aspect of the
   content of any Third Party Sites.

   The fact that we have included a link to a Third Party Site from
   British Council Digital Services should not be taken as an endorsement
   of that Third Party Site, or any association with its operators, by the
   British Council.

   Any purchase of goods or services through a Third Party Site will be
   subject to the terms and conditions of sale brought to your attention
   before or at the time of purchase.

Can I post links to British Council Digital Services or British Council
Content on my website, or other social networking services?

   As a general rule, the British Council will not object if you have a
   text link from your website, or social media page, to British Council
   Digital Services that are accessible free of charge. However, you may
   not copy any part of British Council Digital Services into different
   websites or products without our prior written permission and you may
   not publish or otherwise use direct links to British Council Content
   (without the context of the relevant British Council Digital Service)
   without our prior written permission. Nothing in this paragraph is
   intended to prevent you from re-tweeting British Council Content.

   You are not allowed to link to British Council Digital Services if you
   create or post any illegal, obscene or offensive content, or if the
   link is likely to have a negative impact on the British Council’s
   reputation.

   The British Council will always have the right to restrict the use of
   links to British Council Digital Services that require payment to
   access.

15. How does the British Council protect my personal information?

How will my personal information be protected?

   The British Council is the data controller of any personal data
   collected through British Council Digital Services for the purpose of
   the UK Data Protection Act 2018.

   When you use British Council Digital Services, any personal data
   (including sensitive personal data) collected from you will be handled
   in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

   When we collect information for a specific product or service, we will
   explain why we need the information and how it will be used.

   You can also request a copy of the information the British Council
   holds about you.

Do any British Council Digital Services use cookies?

   Yes. Some British Council Digital Services use cookies to try to
   enhance your experience using British Council Digital Services. For
   more information on the cookies we use, and to find out how to block
   cookies, view the Cookies Policy published for the relevant British
   Council Digital Service.

16. What happens if anything goes wrong with British Council Digital
Services?

   British Council Digital Services and any information or other material
   contained in them are made available strictly on the basis that you
   accept them on an ‘as is’ and ‘as available’ basis. Where you rely on
   any information or other material contained in British Council Digital
   Services, you do so entirely at your own risk and you accept that all
   warranties, conditions and undertakings, express or implied, whether by
   common law, statute, trade usage, course of dealings or otherwise in
   respect of British Council Digital Services are excluded to the fullest
   extent permitted by law.

   British Council Digital Services have been prepared with the aim of
   providing key information about the British Council and the work we do,
   and do not constitute advice in relation to any particular situation.

   Consequently, the British Council and all subsidiary entities of the
   British Council, and each of their respective officers, directors,
   shareholders, employees, representatives and agents, exclude all
   liability arising from your use of British Council Digital Services to
   the fullest extent permitted by law.

17. Which laws apply to my use of British Council Digital Services?

   The laws of England and Wales apply. These Terms of Use and any dispute
   or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject
   matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims)
   shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
   England and Wales.

   The English courts will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over any claim
   arising from, or related to, these Terms of Use and/or any British
   Council Digital Services. This means that all claims relating to these
   Terms of Use and/or British Council Digital Services can be settled by
   a judge (or a number of judges) in an English court. However, the
   British Council retains the right to bring proceedings against you for
   breach of these Terms of Use in your country of residence or any other
   relevant country.

18. What terms will apply if I pay for particular British Council Digital
Services or British Council Content?

   Some British Council Digital Services and British Council Content will
   only be available if you have paid for access to them. In these
   circumstances, additional terms and conditions that apply to your
   purchase of relevant British Council Digital Services and British
   Council Content will be drawn to your attention before you make your
   purchase, and you will be asked to confirm your agreement to those
   additional terms. These Terms of Use will also apply to the contract
   between you and the British Council for the purchase of any British
   Council Digital Services and British Council Content (unless, and only
   to the extent, there is any inconsistency with the additional terms
   that we draw to your attention at the time of purchase).

19. Will these Terms of Use ever change?

   The Terms of Use may change from time to time and, if they do, the
   up-to-date version will always be available on www.britishcouncil.org
   (and we will always make the up-to-date version of the Terms of Use
   available to you through British Council Digital Services).

   We will also indicate at the top of these Terms of Use when they were
   last updated.

   Any revised version of these Terms of Use will be effective immediately
   when it is displayed on www.britishcouncil.org.

   The British Council is the United Kingdom’s international organisation
   for cultural relations and educational opportunities.

   We believe that child protection requires everyone to take
   responsibility and that every child matters. We recognise that the
   care, protection and welfare of children is paramount and that all
   children have the right to be protected from all types of harm.  We
   also recognise that we have a fundamental duty of care towards all
   children where our programmes and operations facilitate contact with
   children, or have an impact on children. This includes a duty to
   protect children from harm or risk of harm as a result of:
     * misconduct by our staff or partners
     * poor practice
     * the poor design or delivery of our programmes and operations.

   We aim to achieve this through compliance with UK child protection laws
   and the relevant laws in each of the countries where we operate and by
   adhering to Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights
   of the Child (UNCRC) 1989.

   A child is defined in the British Council as anyone who has not reached
   their 18th birthday (UNCRC 1989) irrespective of the age of majority in
   the country where the child is, or in their home country.

   The British Council is committed to:
     * valuing, respecting and listening to children
     * ensuring all necessary checks are made when recruiting staff
     * maintaining strong child protection systems and procedures for
       staff
     * training its staff and providing a common understanding of child
       protection issues to inform planning and practice
     * sharing information about child protection and good practice with
       children and parents/carers
     * sharing information about any concerns with the relevant agencies
       and involving parents and children appropriately
     * providing effective management for staff through clear processes,
       supervision and support.

   We will provide adequate and appropriate resources to implement this
   policy and will ensure it is communicated and understood.

   The British Council will review this global policy statement annually
   to reflect new legal and regulatory developments and ensure good
   practice.

   This global policy statement was approved by Sir Ciarán Devane, Chief
   Executive, in March 2019 and is due for review in March 2020.

   British Council Content may sometimes include content which is owned or
   controlled by another person or organisation but which the British
   Council has a licence to make available to you through the relevant

9. What should I be aware of when using British Council Content?

Does British Council Content always reflect the view of the British Council?

   No.  The British Council encourages freedom of expression, but the

Will British Council Content always be accurate?

   Although every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that British

   prior written approval, including:
     * commercial purposes except as expressly stated by the British

Some British Council Digital Services enable you to share Your Content with

   When we refer to ‘Your Content’ we mean any content created, developed

   through your password-protected account.  For example, Your Content
   might include comments, articles, photographs, graphics, audios,

   to British Council Digital Services.

12. What should I be aware of when I contribute my own content to British
Council Digital Services?

Will my contribution to British Council Digital Services always be
acknowledged?

   We normally show your name with your contribution, unless you request
   otherwise, but for operational reasons this is not always possible.

Will the British Council moderate my contribution to British Council Digital
Services?

   Some British Council Digital Services are moderated to check that Your
   Content is consistent with these Terms of Use.  We will always try to
   publish Your Content as soon as reasonably practicable but we cannot
   guarantee that content you submit for publication through British
   Council Digital Services will always be published.

   The British Council reserves the right to remove any of Your Content
   from British Council Digital Services if we believe that it does not
   comply with these Terms of Use.

Will I continue to own content I contribute to British Council Digital
Services?

   Provided that Your Content is your original work, you will continue to
   own Your Content and copyright in Your Content will remain with you.
   The rights granted to the British Council to make use of Your Content
   are not exclusive, so you can continue to use the material in any way,
   including allowing others to use Your Content.

   By uploading or otherwise adding Your Content to any British Council
   Digital Services, you confirm that all Your Content is your original
   work, is not defamatory, does not infringe any laws and that you have
   the consent of anyone who is identifiable in Your Content (or the
   consent of their parent/guardian if they are under 18).

What can the British Council do with my content?

   By uploading or otherwise adding Your Content to any British Council
   Digital Services, you grant to the British Council, free of charge,
   permission to use Your Content (including modifying and adapting it for
   operational and editorial reasons) in any media worldwide for the
   purposes explained in the relevant British Council Digital Service and
   for encouraging networking and wider conversation about educational
   opportunities and cultural relations. If you do not want the British
   Council to make use of Your Content, please do not upload or otherwise
   add any content to British Council Digital Services.

   You are advised to keep a copy of all Your Content because the British
   Council cannot guarantee to return a copy of Your Content to you at any
   time.

13. Will British Council Digital Services always be available?

We use our reasonable endeavours to ensure British Council Digital Services
are available to you.

   However, owing to the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee that
   British Council Digital Services or the websites to which they are
   linked will be available to you.  You should ensure that you have
   appropriate protection against viruses and other malware and other
   security arrangements in place whilst using the internet.

   British Council Content is selected, edited, updated and made available
   to all users by the British Council through British Council Digital
   Services at our sole discretion.  This means that we can remove British
   Council Content from a British Council Digital Service at any time.

   We have agreements with third parties that own or control parts of
   British Council Content, and these agreements permit them to make the
   content available through British Council Digital Services.  As a
   result of these agreements, the period of time during which the user
   may access, view and/or listen to British Council Content using British
   Council Digital Services may vary.

14. What terms apply to links to websites that are operated by other people
or organisations?

What links are included from British Council Digital Services?

   British Council Digital Services contain links to other websites on the
   Internet that are operated by other people or organisations (‘Third
   Party Sites’). These Third Party Sites may have their own terms of use,
   so you will need to be aware of these.

   We have no responsibility under these Terms of Use for the accuracy,
   copyright compliance, legality, decency, or any other aspect of the
   content of any Third Party Sites.

   The fact that we have included a link to a Third Party Site from
   British Council Digital Services should not be taken as an endorsement
   of that Third Party Site, or any association with its operators, by the
   British Council.

   Any purchase of goods or services through a Third Party Site will be
   subject to the terms and conditions of sale brought to your attention
   before or at the time of purchase.

Can I post links to British Council Digital Services or British Council
Content on my website, or other social networking services?

   As a general rule, the British Council will not object if you have a
   text link from your website, or social media page, to British Council
   Digital Services that are accessible free of charge. However, you may
   not copy any part of British Council Digital Services into different
   websites or products without our prior written permission and you may
   not publish or otherwise use direct links to British Council Content
   (without the context of the relevant British Council Digital Service)
   without our prior written permission. Nothing in this paragraph is
   intended to prevent you from re-tweeting British Council Content.

   You are not allowed to link to British Council Digital Services if you
   create or post any illegal, obscene or offensive content, or if the
   link is likely to have a negative impact on the British Council’s
   reputation.

   The British Council will always have the right to restrict the use of
   links to British Council Digital Services that require payment to
   access.

15. How does the British Council protect my personal information?

How will my personal information be protected?

   The British Council is the data controller of any personal data
   collected through British Council Digital Services for the purpose of
   the UK Data Protection Act 2018.

   When you use British Council Digital Services, any personal data
   (including sensitive personal data) collected from you will be handled
   in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

   When we collect information for a specific product or service, we will
   explain why we need the information and how it will be used.

   You can also request a copy of the information the British Council
   holds about you.

Do any British Council Digital Services use cookies?

   Yes. Some British Council Digital Services use cookies to try to
   enhance your experience using British Council Digital Services. For
   more information on the cookies we use, and to find out how to block
   cookies, view the Cookies Policy published for the relevant British
   Council Digital Service.

16. What happens if anything goes wrong with British Council Digital
Services?

   British Council Digital Services and any information or other material
   contained in them are made available strictly on the basis that you
   accept them on an ‘as is’ and ‘as available’ basis. Where you rely on
   any information or other material contained in British Council Digital
   Services, you do so entirely at your own risk and you accept that all
   warranties, conditions and undertakings, express or implied, whether by
   common law, statute, trade usage, course of dealings or otherwise in
   respect of British Council Digital Services are excluded to the fullest
   extent permitted by law.

   British Council Digital Services have been prepared with the aim of
   providing key information about the British Council and the work we do,
   and do not constitute advice in relation to any particular situation.

   Consequently, the British Council and all subsidiary entities of the
   British Council, and each of their respective officers, directors,
   shareholders, employees, representatives and agents, exclude all
   liability arising from your use of British Council Digital Services to
   the fullest extent permitted by law.

17. Which laws apply to my use of British Council Digital Services?

   The laws of England and Wales apply. These Terms of Use and any dispute
   or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject
   matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims)
   shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
   England and Wales.

   The English courts will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over any claim
   arising from, or related to, these Terms of Use and/or any British
   Council Digital Services. This means that all claims relating to these
   Terms of Use and/or British Council Digital Services can be settled by
   a judge (or a number of judges) in an English court. However, the
   British Council retains the right to bring proceedings against you for
   breach of these Terms of Use in your country of residence or any other
   relevant country.

18. What terms will apply if I pay for particular British Council Digital
Services or British Council Content?

   Some British Council Digital Services and British Council Content will
   only be available if you have paid for access to them. In these
   circumstances, additional terms and conditions that apply to your
   purchase of relevant British Council Digital Services and British
   Council Content will be drawn to your attention before you make your
   purchase, and you will be asked to confirm your agreement to those
   additional terms. These Terms of Use will also apply to the contract
   between you and the British Council for the purchase of any British
   Council Digital Services and British Council Content (unless, and only
   to the extent, there is any inconsistency with the additional terms
   that we draw to your attention at the time of purchase).

19. Will these Terms of Use ever change?

   The Terms of Use may change from time to time and, if they do, the
   up-to-date version will always be available on www.britishcouncil.org
   (and we will always make the up-to-date version of the Terms of Use
   available to you through British Council Digital Services).

   We will also indicate at the top of these Terms of Use when they were
   last updated.

   Any revised version of these Terms of Use will be effective immediately
   when it is displayed on www.britishcouncil.org.
