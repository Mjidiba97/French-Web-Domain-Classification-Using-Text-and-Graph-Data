   How to contact WikiLeaks? What is Tor? Tips for Sources After
   Submitting

Contact

   If you need help using Tor you can contact WikiLeaks for assistance in
   setting it up using our simple webchat available at:
   https://wikileaks.org/talk

   If you can use Tor, but need to contact WikiLeaks for other reasons use
   our secured webchat available at http://wlchatc3pjwpli5r.onion

   We recommend contacting us over Tor if you can.

   How to contact WikiLeaks? What is Tor? Tips for Sources After
   Submitting

Tor

   Tor is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to
   intercept internet communications, or see where communications are
   coming from or going to.

   In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed
   above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like
   browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and
   pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.

Tails

   If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can
   also access the submission system through a secure operating system
   called Tails. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or
   a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after
   use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails
   will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big
   and a laptop or desktop computer.

Tips

   Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we
   recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review
   these basic guidelines.

1. Contact us if you have specific problems

   If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex
   format, or are a high-risk source, please contact us. In our experience
   it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most
   seemingly difficult situations.

2. What computer to use

   If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in
   an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to
   you. Technical users can also use Tails to help ensure you do not leave
   any records of your submission on the computer.

3. Do not talk about your submission to others

   If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in
   source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well
   often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This
   includes other media organisations.

1. Do not talk about your submission to others

   If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in
   source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well
   often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This
   includes other media organisations.

2. Act normal

   If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything
   after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you
   should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.

3. Remove traces of your submission

   If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your
   submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an
   investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer
   hard drive and any other storage media you used.

   In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be
   visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory
   cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you
   used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy
   the media.

   If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there
   are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw
   suspicion.

4. If you face legal action

   If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your
   submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage
   Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection
   of journalistic sources. You can find more details at
   https://www.couragefound.org.

Submit documents to WikiLeaks

   WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance
   that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic
   global publishing and large archives.

   The following is the address of our secure site where you can
   anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only
   access this submissions system through Tor. (See our Tor tab for more
   information.) We also advise you to read our tips for sources before
   submitting.
   http://rpzgejae7cxxst5vysqsijblti4duzn3kjsmn43ddi2l3jblhk4a44id.onion
   (Verify)
   Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish,
   can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using
   our public PGP key.

   If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have
   specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods.
   Contact us to discuss how to proceed.
