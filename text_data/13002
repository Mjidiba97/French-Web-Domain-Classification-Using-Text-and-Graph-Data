[xampp-logo.svg] XAMPP Apache + MariaDB + PHP + Perl

Welcome to XAMPP for Linux 7.3.9

   You have successfully installed XAMPP on this system! Now you can start
   using Apache, MariaDB, PHP and other components. You can find more info
   in the FAQs section or check the HOW-TO Guides for getting started with
   PHP applications.

   XAMPP is meant only for development purposes. It has certain
   configuration settings that make it easy to develop locally but that
   are insecure if you want to have your installation accessible to
   others. If you want have your XAMPP accessible from the internet, make
   sure you understand the implications and you checked the FAQs to learn
   how to protect your site. Alternatively you can use WAMP, MAMP or LAMP
   which are similar packages which are more suitable for production.

   Start the XAMPP Control Panel to check the server status.
