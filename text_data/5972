EepURL

   We created EepURL as a trackable shortening service for MailChimp's
   built-in Twitter integration. At the time, we opened it up to the
   public, because we felt there weren't enough monkey-based URL
   shorteners out there.

   This service is no longer available for public use. We made this change
   in order to protect the reputation of the domain and high
   deliverability rates for MailChimp customers who use EepURLs in their
   campaigns.

   Existing URLs are still being redirected, and EepURL still works in the
   app.

   We're trying to prevent the URL from getting blacklisted.

   If you're looking to build your own url shortener, take a moment to
   look at Shaun Inman's Lessn. Building your own url shortener is a good
   way to avoid having your links connected to a blacklisted domain name.
