Report: Data Breach in Adult Site Compromises Privacy of All Users

   Last updated on 21st August 2019

   Led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, vpnMentor’s research team discovered a
   data breach in adult site Luscious.

   Luscious is a niche pornographic image site focused primarily on
   animated, user-uploaded content. Based on the research carried out by
   our team, the site has over 1 million registered users. Each user has a
   profile, the details of which could be accessed through our research.

   Private profiles allow users to upload, share, comment on, and discuss
   content on Luscious. All of this is understandably done while keeping
   their identity hidden behind usernames.

   The data breach our team discovered compromises this anonymity by
   potentially allowing hackers to access the personal details of users,
   including their personal email address. The highly sensitive and
   private nature of Luscious’ content makes users incredibly vulnerable
   to a range of attacks and exploitation by malicious hackers.

Timeline of Discovery and Owner Reaction

     * Date discovered: 15/08/19
     * Date owner contacted: 16/08/19

Example of Entries in the Database

   The data breach gave our team access to 1.195 million user accounts on
   Luscious. All of these were compromised, revealing personal details of
   users with potentially devastating consequences.

   The private personal user details we viewed included:
     * Usernames
     * Personal email addresses
     * User activity logs (date joined, most recent log in)
     * Country of residence/location
     * Gender

   Some users’ email addresses indicated their full names, increasing
   their vulnerability to exploitation and cybercrime.

   It’s worth mentioning that we estimate 20% of emails on Luscious
   accounts use fake email addresses to sign up. This suggests that some
   Luscious users are actively taking extra steps to remain anonymous.

User Behaviours & Activities

   The data breach also gave a complete overview of user activities. This
   allowed us to view things like:
     * The number of image albums they had created
     * Video uploads
     * Comments
     * Blog posts
     * Favorites
     * Followers and accounts followed
     * Their User ID number – so we can know if they’re active or have
       been banned

   While some of this information is visible to other users, much of it
   was hidden in the website’s database. All of this combined information
   creates valuable insights into how people use Luscious.

   Our team was also able to view details of blog posts and content
   published on Luscious. This included the author’s details, along with
   the number of likes, when published, category, etc.

   Some of these blog posts were extremely personal – including depressive
   or otherwise vulnerable content – and kept anonymous. Due to this data
   breach, however, the blog posts are no longer anonymous, with many of
   the authors’ identities revealed.

   Likewise, for images uploaded to Luscious, we gained access an index of
   pictures with detailed information, including who created them.

   The 1 million+ users affected are located around the world, with their
   locations also revealed in the breach. During our research, we were
   able to access user profiles from Europe, Asia, Australia, and the
   Americas.

   For example, we found approximately 13,000 email addresses in “.fr”,
   representing about 1.25% of the database. Considering the number of
   French people who use email hosting like Gmail – ending in “.com” and
   based on the French names we saw on @gmail.com addresses- we estimate
   the actual number of French users to be around 3 times higher:
   approximately 40,000.

   Below is a table outlining the international distribution of Luscious
   users, based on email addresses and our estimations of real numbers,
   considering Gmail accounts and Similarweb stats.
    Country Our estimation of users based on the email addresses found in
   the DB
    France   40,000
    Netherlands  8,000
    Sweden  6,000
    Germany  50,000
    Spain  7,000
    Russia  35,000
    Israel  1,000
    Italy  18,000
    Brazil  10,000
    Canada  15,000
    Australia  5,000
    Poland  20,000
    Japan  6,000
    India  6,000

   A greater issue of concern is the fact that many users joined Luscious
   on official government emails. We found examples of this from users in
   Brazil, Australia, Italy, Malaysia, and Australia.
   Domain Our estimation of users based on the email addresses found in
   the DB
   .edu  Less than a thousand
   .gov  Dozens

   This adds a great deal of additional vulnerability not just to the
   users, but also their employers. With access to employee email
   addresses, criminal hackers can target government agencies and
   departments in a number of ways.

Data Breach Impact

   The impact of this data breach on users could be devastating,
   personally and financially. Activity on adult sites like Luscious is
   the most private in nature, and nobody ever expects it to be
   revealed.

   Its exposure could be ruinous for a victim’s relationships and personal
   lives.

   The information made available in Luscious’ databases gives criminal
   and malicious hackers many options to use this data for illicit gains
   and exploiting users.

Doxing

   Doxing refers to the act of investigating an internet user’s identity
   and making it public, usually with malicious intent. With access to
   Luscious users’ email addresses and locations, hackers could easily
   locate their profiles on social media and similar sites.

   With this information, a Luscious user is at risk of being publicly
   exposed for their activity on the website. They could be targeted for
   harassment, bullying, or having the details shared with their family,
   friends, and employers.

   Given the nature of the content on Luscious, the effects of such a
   campaign could be devastating.

Extortion

   Once a Luscious user’s identity is compromised, they can be targeted
   for more than just bullying. Hackers could threaten to expose users
   unless they pay a ransom. Given the sensitive nature of this data
   breach, victims are incredibly vulnerable and likely to pay.

   However, paying a ransom does not guarantee your details won’t be
   revealed anyway. Once this data is stolen, it can be used and sold over
   and over again. This leaves users open to ongoing extortion from one
   hacker, with potential for their Luscious activity to still be leaked
   by another.

Phishing

   Phishing refers to the creation of imitation emails sent to victims to
   trick them into providing passwords or other compromising information,
   giving access to financial accounts or credit cards, and embedding
   malware on a device.

   A hacker or cybercriminal sends a target an email made to look like a
   legitimate business or organization that the victim already uses, to
   extract the desired information or plant malware.

   By revealing personal details like email addresses and location, the
   Luscious data breach helps criminals target users for future
   exploitation, fraud, or theft. They can use this information to create
   effective fraudulent emails and send them directly to a user’s email
   inbox – that way, they also stand out from spam and junk mail.

Competitor Actions

   This data breach also makes Luscious vulnerable. With over 1 million
   users and over 20 million visits per month, it’s a leading website
   within its niche. It’s also no doubt very profitable.

   With the private information now revealed, Luscious’ competitors can
   also analyze user behavior – their favorites, what they like, how they
   interact with other users – and target them with better alternatives.
   Usually, online businesses keep all this information securely hidden,
   as it presents a huge risk to their business model and revenue.

Advice from the Experts

   This data leak could have easily been avoided if Luscious had taken
   some basic security measures. These can be replicated by any company,
   no matter its size:
    1. Secure your servers.
    2. Implement proper access rules.
    3. Never leave a system that doesn’t require authentication open to
       the internet.

For Users

   We suggest you immediately change your Luscious account details,
   including your username and associated email address.

   For adult-themed websites, or any other websites of a sensitive nature,
   always create a username completely unrelated to your personal email
   address or any other online account.

   If you have revealed your location on Luscious, remove this detail from
   your profile. You can also change your location using a VPN.

   To learn more about your internet privacy in general, and how to avoid
   data breaches like this one in your life and business, read our
   complete guide to online privacy.

How and Why We Discovered the Breach

   The vpnMentor research team discovered the breach in Luscious’s
   databases as part of a huge web mapping project. Our hackers use port
   scanning to examine particular IP blocks and test open holes in systems
   for weaknesses. They examine each hole for data being leaked.

   When they find a data breach, they use expert techniques to verify the
   database’s identity. We then alert the company to the breach. If
   possible, we will also alert those affected by the breach.

   Our team was able to access this database because it was completely
   unsecured and unencrypted.

   The company uses an Elasticsearch database, which is ordinarily not
   designed for URL use. However, we were able to access it via browser
   and manipulate the URL search criteria into exposing schemata from a
   single index at any time.

   The purpose of this web mapping project is to help make the internet
   safer for all users.

   As ethical hackers, we’re obliged to inform a company when we discover
   flaws in their online security. This is especially true when the
   companies data breach contains such private information.

   However, these ethics also mean we carry a responsibility to the
   public. Luscious users must be aware of a data breach that impacts them
   also.

10 Best VPN Services: Trusted, Safe & Fast (September 2019 Update)

Ariel Hochstadt | Last updated on 26th September 2019

   Ex-Google, International tech speaker

   Finding the best VPN to keep you safe online feels impossible. There
   are hundreds of VPNs out there, and each one claims it’s the best.

   At vpnMentor, we’ve so far tested more than 300 VPNs for speed,
   security, support, and features. We analyzed stacks of data and skipped
   the biased reviews. Instead, we ran our own tests to bring you a list
   of the top 10 services.

   We even made some calls to Google and PayPal to investigate rumors
   surrounding some VPNs. We also delisted several shady VPNs: while they
   hadn’t yet been caught sharing user data, we’re worried that soon, they
   will.

   We found that while some small VPNs lack the marketing budgets of some
   of the bigger brands, they were able to outperform some of the big
   boys.

   On the other hand, we found that some of the more popular VPNs are
   actually quite worthless – and even dangerous – when put through
   rigorous testing.

   We can honestly say that after this testing process, we’re certain that
   our top 10 VPNs will keep you safe, protect your data, and give you
   lightning-fast streaming speeds.

   If you want to know how we tested and ranked these VPNs, click here.

   Short on time? Here’s a summary of the best VPNs:
    1.
         1. NordVPN – #1 VPN in 2019
         2. ExpressVPN – #1 for speed
         3. CyberGhost – Best VPN for beginners
         4. Surfshark – Best VPN for families or small businesses
         5. PrivateVPN – Best budget VPN Plus 5 more great VPNs you
            shouldn’t miss!

     * Works with: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, HBO GO, Amazon Prime Video,
       Showtime, Sling TV
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, BlackBerry,
       Routers, Raspberry Pi, Android TV, Chrome, Firefox
     * Data logging: Strict no-logs policy

   NordVPN is our #1 VPN recommendation. It provides exceptional
   all-around value, with great features and performance at a price few
   can beat.

   AES-256 encryption and support for OpenVPN and IKEv2/IPSec protocols
   keep your traffic secure and hidden. Since it’s registered in Panama,
   NordVPN is also far away from Fourteen Eyes surveillance and troubling
   data retention laws. This allows it to collect zero sensitive user logs
   – great news for the privacy-conscious.

   The massive NordVPN network has over 5,400 servers in 60+ countries,
   with regular new additions. It offers specialty servers for P2P, double
   encryption, dedicated IPs, and Onion over VPN for Tor users.

   Secure streaming and torrenting are one-click tasks with NordVPN.
   Thanks to proprietary SmartPlay DNS settings, the NordVPN client
   automatically provides reliable access and fast speeds when you open
   Netflix and other streaming services.

   The CyberSec suite is another unique NordVPN feature. It provides
   adblocking and extra malware protection. Advanced obfuscation settings
   ensure the VPN works in countries with heavy censorship such as China.
   Plus, you don’t have to worry about VPN leaks as NordVPN offers two
   different kill switches and custom DNS settings to prevent them.

   If you ever need assistance, you can count on the 24/7 live chat
   customer support to help you out. What’s more, NordVPN has a huge
   knowledge base full of useful info on setups and servers.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You want to pay with PayPal.

   The bottom line? We think NordVPN is the ultimate multi-purpose VPN,
   but we were disappointed that you can’t pay with PayPal. You can test
   its intuitive apps and excellent features on six devices with a
   risk-free 30-day money-back guarantee.

2. ExpressVPN

   Ranked as #2 overall, but #1 for speed
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No (but all servers support P2P
       activity)
     * Works with: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, DAZN, HBO GO, Amazon Prime
       Video, Showtime, Sling TV
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, BlackBerry,
       Routers, Raspberry Pi, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, PlayStation, Xbox,
       Apple TV, Nintendo Switch, Amazon Fire TV, Samsung Smart TV, Roku,
       Chromecast, Nvidia Shield
     * Data logging: Strict no-logs policy

   We tested dozens of VPNs in multiple locations for speed, and
   ExpressVPN came out on top.

   ExpressVPN has 3,000+ high-speed servers at 160 global locations. It’s
   also the fastest VPN we tested, making it ideal for streaming and
   torrenting.

   The split tunneling feature allows you to tailor ExpressVPN to your
   needs by selecting which apps and services are encrypted. This is very
   useful if you want to have access to both local and foreign content on
   the same device.

   There’s more: ExpressVPN can help you access your favorite content even
   on platforms that don’t support VPNs. Thanks to the MediaStreamer
   feature, you can watch freely on your Smart TV, Amazon Fire TV, Apple
   TV, and gaming consoles.

   ExpressVPN supports P2P connections on all servers, so you don’t need a
   torrenting profile. The app’s Smart Location feature chooses the best
   server for you.

   ExpressVPN offers 256-bit encryption and OpenVPN support across all
   platforms, providing robust protection. Additionally, you get DNS leak
   protection and a Network Lock setting – in other words, a kill switch
   for your connection.

   ExpressVPN’s innovative TrustedServer technology guarantees that every
   ExpressVPN server always loads the exact same secure, up-to-date
   software, greatly reducing security risks. TrustedServer also allows
   ExpressVPN servers to operate using only RAM. Because the servers never
   write to the hard drive, it is impossible for any data to be stored on
   the server after a reboot—even accidentally. This offers unprecedented
   levels of security.

   ExpressVPN consistently bypasses the Great Firewall of China, so it’s a
   top pick for regions with heavy censorship, too.

   Customer service is also on point, with helpful 24/7 live chat support
   and detailed setup guides for the many supported platforms.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You are looking for a cheap VPN. ExpressVPN can be twice as
       expensive as some of the other VPNs on this list.

   ExpressVPN offers a winning combination of performance and
   privacy which is certainly worth the money. You can also take it for a
   risk-free test drive on three devices, courtesy of the 30-day
   money-back guarantee. In short, this VPN can easily satisfy even the
   most demanding of users.

   Don’t miss out on the best ExpressVPN deals around. Get the fastest VPN
   at 49% off with our coupons.

     * Works with: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, DAZN, HBO GO, Amazon Prime
       Video, Sky Go

   servers in 60 countries. With leak-proof apps and an extra kill switch
   for good measure, this VPN is both stable and secure.

   CyberGhost boasts one-click setup and use. As well as automatic
   connection to the fastest server, it has dedicated servers for
   streaming and torrenting which help you access Netflix US, Hulu, and
   other popular services.

   It’s also easy to navigate the app’s basic and advanced settings. You
   can set up smart rules and customize your connection features.

   While not as fast as NordVPN or ExpressVPN, CyberGhost offers good
   enough speeds for hassle-free streaming and torrenting. If you do run
   into issues, you can always get help via live chat.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You need a VPN that works in China. At the moment, CyberGhost is
       not able to bypass the Great Firewall of China.

   We think CyberGhost is a simple VPN that does a great job on all
   fronts. This makes it another top pick, and earns it a deserved third
   place in our overall rankings. Try it out yourself on up to 7 devices
   with the free 24-hour trial and 45-day money-back guarantee.

4. Surfshark

   Best VPN for families or small businesses
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No (P2P is allowed on all servers)
     * Works with: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, HBO GO, Amazon Prime Video,
       ESPN
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Routers, Chrome,
       Firefox, Amazon Fire TV
     * Data logging: Strict no-logs policy

   Surfshark is a relatively new VPN service, but it’s already making a
   name for itself.

   As a new provider, Surfshark offers a very rare bonus – unlimited
   simultaneous connections. If you want to protect your whole family (or
   use lots of devices yourself), you won’t find a better deal.

   Of course, this wouldn’t matter if Surfshark didn’t provide a good
   service – but it does. Its features include split tunneling, double
   encryption, kill switch protection, and a security suite called
   CleanWeb that blocks ads and prevents malware. You’ll also find extra
   obfuscation settings with the NoBorders mode, while Camouflage
   Mode prevents even your ISP from seeing that you’re connected to a VPN.

   Surfshark’s growing network includes over 800 servers in 50+ countries.
   This means you’ll always have fast and reliable access to your desired
   content.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You need to install your VPN on a router – Surfshark doesn’t have a
       dedicated router app.

   Overall, Surfshark is an impressive VPN with premium value and simple,
   stylish apps. They offer great bargains with high discounts on
   long-term plans and a one-month refund period.

5. PrivateVPN

   Best budget VPN
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No, but P2P traffic is allowed on all
       servers
     * Works with: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, HBO GO, Amazon Prime Video
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Routers
     * Data logging: Strict no-logs policy

   PrivateVPN is an affordable service with an excellent reputation. It
   manages a compact network of 150+ self-owned servers in 59 countries at
   more than 80 different locations.

   This Sweden-based provider is committed to ensuring its users’ privacy
   and security. Although subject to 14-Eyes jurisdiction, PrivateVPN
   can’t turn over your data as it doesn’t log any. The simple,
   easy-to-use apps come with AES-256 encryption and support for multiple
   protocols, including industry standard OpenVPN.

   As well as a kill switch, PrivateVPN offers IPv6 and DNS leak
   protection. It also has a Stealth mode designed to bypass VPN blocks
   and DPI firewalls, giving you unlimited access to global content.

   While it doesn’t have thousands of servers and flashy features,
   PrivateVPN remains an excellent choice for accessing your favorite
   geoblocked content. It allows P2P connections on all servers and offers
   specialized servers for Netflix and other favorite streaming channels.
   PrivateVPN’s impressive speeds mean you won’t have to wait for
   buffering or lagging: choose your profile and start watching!

   Don’t Use If:
     * You want a VPN with a large number of servers.

   If you’re hunting for a budget provider with low prices on both short-
   and long-term plans, PrivateVPN could be what you need. The 30-day
   money-back guarantee gives you enough time to test this VPN yourself.

6. IPVanish

   Great apps and stable speeds
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No
     * Works with: Netflix, BBC iPlayer
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows Phone,
       Routers, Chromebook, Amazon Fire TV
     * Data logging: Strict no-logs policy

   The balance between security and performance makes IPVanish another top
   VPN pick. With 1,200+ servers, decent unblocking powers, and reliable
   protection, this provider has a lot to offer.

   256-bit encryption and a variety of VPN protocols – including OpenVPN –
   make IPVanish secure. A kill switch and DNS/IPv6 leak protection ensure
   you’re always protected.

   Speeds are fast and reliable, so you don’t have to worry about annoying
   connection drops or stability issues. What’s more, IPVanish recently
   improved its Netflix servers, making it reliable for streaming.

   IPVanish supports P2P connections and SOCKS5 proxies for fast torrent
   downloads. Although IPVanish is US-based (which would usually subject
   it to DMCA requests), it operates a legitimate zero-logging policy – so
   the US jurisdiction shouldn’t be an issue for torrenting fans.

   IPVanish also provides extra obfuscation settings and additional IP
   configuration like reset intervals. These features, along with the 24/7
   customer support and 10 simultaneous connections, make it stand out
   from many other VPN services. We wish the refund period were a little
   longer, but a 7-day money-back guarantee is still better than nothing.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You are looking for a cheap VPN.

   IPVanish isn’t the cheapest provider around, but the price is right for
   the great value this VPN provides.

   Try IPVanish Now!

7. Hotspot Shield

   Reliable protection and easy streaming
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No
     * Works with: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Chrome
     * Data logging: Yes (keeps connection logs for the duration of VPN
       sessions, as well as data for marketing purposes)

   Hotspot Shield’s paid VPN – known as Hotspot Shield Premium – includes
   access to more than 2,500 worldwide servers, as well as elegant apps
   and fast speeds. Does that make it worth the cost?

   We’d say so. This VPN is a solid choice for both casual and power
   users, providing excellent security on with 128-bit/256-bit encryption
   and proprietary Catapult Hydra protocol (based on OpenSSL).

   Hotspot Shield compresses data during streaming for optimized Netflix
   access and buffer-free streaming.

   For features, you get the essential kill switch and not much else. You
   won’t find custom DNS settings or extra help for torrenting. Although
   P2P traffic is allowed, you’d be better off with another VPN on this
   list if torrenting is a priority for you.

   That’s because, despite its excellent overall performance, Hotspot
   Shield isn’t a no-logs VPN service. Combined with the U.S.
   jurisdiction, this could make you an easy target for copyright trolls
   or DMCA requests – especially if you’re a US resident.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You need a VPN for torrenting.

   Even though Hotspot Shield has its drawbacks, it remains a popular,
   powerful, and affordable VPN service. We recommend taking it for a test
   drive with the 45-day money-back guarantee.

8. HideMyAss! (HMA)

   #1 for server network size – If HMA doesn’t have a server there, no one
   does
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No
     * Works with: Hulu, BBC iPlayer
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Routers
     * Data logging: Yes (keeps connection logs for 30 days or more, but
       not bandwidth logs)

   Aside from its cheerful tone and funny theme, HideMyAss! also has a
   massive server network.

   You get high-speed servers in over 190 countries, which is pretty close
   to 100% global presence. Impressive! Don’t count on unblocking Netflix,
   though – HideMyAss! has had issues with it for a while. Hulu and BBC
   iPlayer should work fine, though.

   HideMyAss! offers strong security, with OpenVPN support and AES-256
   encryption to keep you safe. Unfortunately, it has the same problem as
   Hotspot Shield – it keeps connection logs. It also operates in the UK,
   so has to comply with some of the worst data retention laws in Europe
   and is subject to 14-Eyes jurisdiction. The result? This VPN shouldn’t
   be your first pick if you want perfect privacy.

   On the upside, HideMyAss! is easy to use with great desktop and mobile
   apps. Support isn’t ideal, though – between the limited live chat
   (workdays only) and somewhat slow response times, you may wait a while
   before getting a reply.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You need a VPN to access Netflix catalogs outside your country
       (such as Netflix US).

   The bottom line? If you need a fast VPN with a huge number of server
   locations and you don’t care about Netflix too much, consider HMA.

   You can even get a full refund within 30 days as long as it’s your
   first HideMyAss! purchase and you haven’t used more than 10 GB of
   bandwidth.

   Try HideMyAss Now!

9. VyprVPN

   An impressive desktop VPN – for a price
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No
     * Works with: Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Routers, Android TV,
       QNAP, Blackphone, Anonabox
     * Data logging: Strict no-logging policy

   VyprVPN offers customers two different versions, but if you’re a
   Windows or Mac user, you’ll want the Premium plan.

   In addition to 700+ servers and a zero-logs policy, VyprVPN Premium
   gives you the feature it’s famous for: its proprietary Chameleon
   protocol.

   An improved version of OpenVPN, Chameleon provides additional
   protection and extra muscle for bypassing geoblocks. This makes VyprVPN
   a reliable choice for accessing Netflix US and other popular streams.

   Sadly, Chameleon is currently only available on desktop apps. Still,
   VyprVPN’s base package offers outstanding privacy and performance on
   mobile. The software is leak-proof, stylish, and most importantly –
   easy to use.

   VyprVPN is by no means a budget service, but you get great discounts if
   you opt for a longer plan. VyprVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee
   so you can try the service risk-free.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You want to pay with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies
     * You want a VPN with responsive 24/7 customer service

   VyprVPN has proven itself as a reliable provider that values user
   privacy.

10. ZenMate

   A simple VPN that gets the job done
     * Dedicated torrenting profile: No (allows P2P traffic)
     * Works with: Netflix
     * Available on: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Chrome, Firefox, Opera
     * Data logging: Strict no-logging policy

   We finish our comparison with a provider that sticks to the basics.
   ZenMate doesn’t stand out as much as other services that made our list,
   but there’s a very good reason it’s here.

   For a modest price, ZenMate gives you OpenVPN encryption, a tight
   zero-logging policy, and over 290 servers in 30 countries. P2P traffic
   is allowed, even if there isn’t a separate profile for torrenting, and
   speeds are fast enough for HD streaming without issues.

   There’s also a kill switch, so you won’t leak sensitive data if your
   connection crashes. This used to happen frequently– but after some
   improvements, ZenMate is more stable than ever.

   If live chat support matters to you, ZenMate VPN will probably
   disappoint as it only offers a ticket system. Still, you can expect
   timely and detailed responses from the friendly staff.

   We like to see VPN providers getting better and better. ZenMate is one
   of those providers – with massive improvements to the overall service,
   this VPN has grown enough to deserve a spot among the best of 2019.

   Don’t Use If:
     * You need a VPN for streaming. Zenmate only really gives you access
       to Netflix.

Choosing the Best VPN Service: How We Ranked & Compared These VPNs

   There are hundreds of VPN services available, and each one claims to be
   perfect for your needs. Choosing the best VPN can be difficult. Our
   in-depth recommendations consider the most important criteria, giving
   you all the information you’ll need to make the right choice.

Security

   Two crucial aspects of a top VPN are privacy and security. You’ll be
   hard-pressed to find a provider that doesn’t offer them on paper – but
   things can be different in reality.

   A VPN with a verified no-logs policy ensures that your digital
   footprint is secure. No-logs policies mean none of your data is
   collected, stored, or shared while you’re browsing. It protects you
   from prying eyes and preserves your privacy, making it one of the
   leading criteria in our VPN rankings.

Speed

   Another must-have ingredient in the recipe for the best VPN is speed.
   Using a VPN means your traffic is sent through additional servers,
   affecting your speed. Every VPN will slow you down in some way; the
   real question is by how much. The fastest VPN services have the
   smallest impact on your connection quality. They’ll let you browse,
   torrent, and stream without annoying lag or buffering.

   A really fast VPN can also help you help you overcome ISP throttling.
   You may end up with faster speeds than you started with.

Streaming

   Speaking of streaming, VPNs are a popular solution for accessing the
   full range of content on platforms like Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, and
   DAZN. Such platforms limit their service depending on your region, but
   connecting to the right VPN server can open the door to your favorite
   shows.

Torrenting

   VPNs are also useful for torrenting fans – especially in countries
   where torrents are prohibited. Even if you follow the rules (we
   recommend you do), torrenting without extra protection can expose you
   to greedy copyright trolls and hackers.

   P2P connections aren’t secure, but you can change that with a good VPN
   for torrenting. By masking your real IP address and hiding your traffic
   behind a layer of encryption, you’ll avoid all the threats that come
   with downloading torrents while enjoying the benefits. In our VPN
   comparison, we checked out torrenting features like P2P profiles,
   SOCKS5 proxies, and easy setup with torrent clients.

Censorship

   Last but not least, let’s talk censorship. You know you’ve landed on a
   reliable provider when your VPN works in a country that actively tries
   to block it. During our research, we looked at special features and
   settings for extra obfuscation. The top VPN services in our overall
   list have proven themselves in censorship-heavy regions like China,
   Iran, and the UAE.

   Many other factors played a significant part in our final rankings.
   These include server network size, encryption, security features, ease
   of use, and of course – price. We spared no expense in exploring every
   detail for our VPN reviews and tests.

   What’s the Best VPN for My Device/Software/Operating System?

Free vs. Paid VPN: Are Free VPNs Safe?

   One could argue that you shouldn’t have to buy your right to online
   privacy. While we agree with this in theory, we also need to face
   reality.

   VPN providers offer a service in exchange for something. And when that
   something isn’t money, it’s usually much worse. There’s no such thing
   as truly free: chances are, if you’re not paying for a product, you are
   the product.

   Sadly, most free VPNs have serious limitations, and pose serious
   threats to user privacy and security. From slow speeds and bandwidth
   restrictions to annoying ads and even selling your data, there are
   plenty of valid reasons to avoid free VPNs.

   Take Hola, for example. This free VPN service is essentially a
   glorified proxy that uses peer-to-peer file sharing to reroute users’
   traffic. Not only is your bandwidth shared, but Hola collects and logs
   almost all the data from your browsing session. Their “privacy policy”
   even specifies that it will share your data with third parties,
   affiliates, and partners.

   Not all free VPNs are bad. We rigorously tested dozens of free
   services, and found some free VPNs which are safe to use. But is that
   enough?

   When you look at the extra value paid VPNs offer, you probably won’t
   want a free service. It’s simple – if you want a provider that will
   guarantee your privacy and give you the servers and features you need,
   it’s better to pay a few bucks than end up disappointed with a free
   VPN.

   Keep in mind that you can bring down the overall cost of a paid VPN
   considerably by taking advantage of discount deals and coupon codes.
   That way, you can get a premium service for pocket change – a win-win
   situation!

   Many top VPN services also offer free trials so you can test out their
   service for free. Most offer money-back guarantees as well, so you can
   have a risk-free test period to make sure you’re happy with the
   service.

Is a VPN Legal to Use?

   Because VPNs can be used to facilitate illegal activities, many believe
   the software itself is against the law. This isn’t true.

   It’s legal to use a VPN in 95.9% of countries. Using a VPN is illegal
   (or falls in a gray area) in:
     * China
     * Iraq
     * Iran
     * Russia
     * Belarus
     * Turkey
     * Oman
     * UAE

   Using a VPN is a common practice. Many companies use them to protect
   sensitive data, decrease the risk of hacking, and to perform market
   research in different countries.

   Hiding behind a VPN while engaging in criminal acts is illegal. But
   this isn’t a problem with the VPN itself – especially when millions are
   using these services for security and privacy.

Is it Safe to Use a VPN?

   VPNs are safe to use in most countries. However, it’s your
   responsibility to make sure you follow the rules and stay out of
   trouble.

   However, you may be taking a risk if:
     * You use a non-government-permitted VPN in a country where the
       government mandates which VPNs are allowed
     * You torrent copyrighted material with a VPN that keeps logs or
       doesn’t have a kill switch.

How Do I Use a VPN?

   Nowadays, using a VPN is as simple as downloading the software from
   your provider’s website and installing it. Setup usually takes just a
   couple of minutes.

   Most VPN services are user-friendly, with intuitive interfaces and
   straightforward instructions. All you need to do is select a secure
   server from the list – or let the VPN app choose an optimal location if
   it has a quick-connect feature.

   If you don’t have any experience with VPNs, don’t worry! It’s much
   easier than it sounds – especially if you catch up with our detailed
   beginner’s guide.

How Much Does a VPN Cost? Can I Get a Good Cheap VPN?

   Thankfully, premium VPNs don’t come at premium prices. While monthly
   subscriptions are expensive, investing in a long-term plan means you’ll
   probably pay the equivalent of $3 – $7 per month.

   In fact, you can actually get a top-quality VPN service for less than
   $3/month!

   It’s also worth noting that many VPNs offer free trials, so you can
   test if their service meets your safety and streaming needs.

   Most also have money-back guarantee refund policies. Depending on which
   service you choose, you’ll have between 7 – 45 days to cancel your
   service risk-free if you’re not happy.

   You can also save on your subscription by using our deals and coupon
   codes.

Can I Use Tor or a Proxy Instead of a VPN?

   Tor, proxies, and VPNs are three completely different types of software
   that sometimes serve the same use. Let’s take a closer look.

   Tor (short for The Onion Router) utilizes an anonymizing network that
   bounces your connection through several volunteer servers. While this
   process makes you (and your data) much harder to track, it will slow
   you down. Tor is a very complex topic, so check out our ultimate guide
   to Tor if you’re curious for more info and tips.

   Compared to VPNs, Tor has its drawbacks. While it’s free to use, it
   provides weaker encryption and slower connections. The best move is to
   use both Tor and a VPN together and reap all the benefits. A stable VPN
   removes Tor’s weaknesses, while Tor improves your privacy even further.

   That said, not all VPNs are compatible with Tor. To make it work, you
   need a VPN like NordVPN which offers specialized Tor over VPN servers.

   Proxy services have one advantage over VPNs: they offer fast speeds
   (and hide your IP address). However, they have no other security
   features, don’t encrypt your data, and don’t even offer an interface.

   These features mean proxies are not secure or easy to use. However,
   they can improve your connection speeds if privacy isn’t a concern for
   you.

   There are hundreds of proxies out there, so it’s important to choose
   the right one. Better yet, invest in a fast, cheap VPN and benefit from
   extra protection and privacy on top of great speeds.

   Note: We at vpnMentor provide a free proxy tool! Feel free to use it if
   you’re in a hurry and don’t have time to pick and choose.

What’s the Best VPN for My Device/Software/Operating System?

   The same VPN service can have several different versions depending on
   which platform it’s designed for. For example, even if your VPN is
   flawless on Windows, its mobile app may be broken and unstable on your
   phone.

   In truth, there isn’t a VPN provider that’s universally best for every
   device, software, or operating system. In order to make the right
   choice, you’ll need to do some research and find the top-rated VPNs for
   your needs.
