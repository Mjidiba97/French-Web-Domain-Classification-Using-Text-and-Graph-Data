   Glarysoft's Glary Utilities is one of the most consistently popular and
   most frequently recommended system utilities, and why not? It bundles
   some of the most useful Windows-related tools in one free download. It
   scans and cleans your PC, cleaning temporary files, removing junk
   files, fixing broken shortcuts, and resolving a wide range of issues,
   both major and minor, that most Windows users will have no trouble
   recognizing. You can configure its One-Click Maintenance option to run
   just those processes you want with a single click, making regular
   maintenance just too easy for excuses. You can run any of its many
   tools individually, too

   Defrag Show and Settings, which offers all basic functions, so it is

   safely, without any damage to your hard drive and the data stored on
   it.

Media Review

   Disk SpeedUp features a nicely designed interface and is very easy to
   use. The program works with all main file systems and has support for
   scheduled scans as well. And besides the basic defrag functionality,
   Disk SpeedUp also includes an optimization tool – which is slower, but
   offers better results.
