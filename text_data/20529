Web preferences

Enable Autofill

   If you enable Autofill, Opera can complete common forms for you online
   including your address or credit card information.

   To enable Autofill:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Passwords and forms, click Autofill settings.
    4. Turn on Autofill forms.

   To add an address or credit card for Opera to use when automatically
   filling in forms, click the Add button.

   Your contact or credit card information can later be edited or removed.
   Click the  menu next to the item you wish to edit or remove.

Manage camera access on pages

   Some sites may ask to access your computer’s camera.

   By default, Opera will always ask you to allow a site to access your
   camera. Opera will remember your sharing choice if the site is secured
   through an HTTPS connection.

   To allow or block sites from accessing your camera:
    1. Go to Settings .
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Camera.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Ask before accessing (recommended).

   You can also set which camera you wish Opera to use by default, if you
   have more than one connected to your computer. Use the dropdown menu to
   set your camera preference.

Manage cookies in pages

   Cookies are small data files that store information in connection with
   a website. For example, a cookie may be created to store the contents
   of a shopping basket or to confirm that you are logged in as you browse
   the pages of a site.

   Cookies can be used to construct a profile of your browsing habits and
   are therefore regarded by some as a privacy issue.

Set your cookie preferences

   Setting preferences gives you control of how Opera handles cookies. The
   default setting is to accept all cookies.

   To set your cookie preferences:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Cookies.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Allow sites to save and read cookie data
       (recommended).

   There are two additional options for handling cookies:
     * Keep local data only until you quit your browser – Deletes cookies
       that have been added after this preference was enabled when closing
       the browser.
     * Block third-party cookies – Blocks cookies set by other websites
       whose content is displayed in frames or images on the current
       website you are visiting. Blocking third-party cookies will allow
       only the cookies for the site you are visiting to be set on your
       system.

   Click the Add button next to the Block, Clear on exit, or Allow
   sections to set site-specific cookie preferences for websites.

   Type [*.] before the domain name to create an exception for an entire
   domain name. Creating an [*.]opera.com cookie exception will apply to
   pages such as blogs.opera.com and addons.opera.com. IP addresses can
   also be added as exceptions.

Manage how links are handled

   Some sites may ask to open special types of links by default. These are
   called protocol handlers. For example, you can set Opera to
   open ical: links in Google Calendar’s web app or force mailto: links to
   open in your email web app.

   To allow or not allow sites to ask to be the default handlers of
   specific types of links:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Handlers.
    5. At the top, click Allow sites to ask to become default handlers for
       protocols (recommended) or Do not allow any site to handle
       protocols.

   Click the  menu next to a handler to remove it.

Manage images on pages

   You can control how Opera handles images on the pages you view. You can
   opt to display all images or not, as well as set site-specific image
   preferences.

   To change image settings:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Images.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Show all (recommended).

   Click the Add button to set site-specific preferences.

Manage JavaScript in pages

   JavaScript is a scripting language used to add functions to pages, such
   as manipulating browser windows. In rare cases, JavaScript may be used
   intrusively to perform certain actions you may find annoying. For these
   cases, you can turn it off completely. If you do, some pages will not
   work as designed.

   To change JavaScript settings:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click JavaScript.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Allowed (recommended).

   Click the Add button to set site-specific preferences.

Manage location sharing in pages

   Some sites may ask to use your location to provide localized features,
   such as reviews for nearby shops or coupons from businesses located in
   your area. To do this, these sites may ask you to allow geolocation on
   the page. You can choose whether or not to share your location when
   browsing. Opera will not share this information without your
   permission.

   Setting location sharing preferences gives you control over how sites
   access your location. By default, Opera asks you if you’d like to share
   your location the first time you visit a site that requests it. You can
   choose to allow or deny access to your location, and Opera will
   remember your choice for future visits to that site.

   To manage your location sharing preferences:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Location.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Ask before accessing (recommended).

   Click the  icon to remove individual site exceptions.

   Read more about geolocation and location sharing.

Manage microphone access in pages

   Some sites and web apps may ask to access your computer’s microphone.
   For example, a live-chat app may want to use your mic so you can speak
   to another person through their service.

   By default, Opera will always ask you to allow a site to access your
   microphone. Opera will remember your sharing choice if the site is
   secured through an HTTPS connection.

   To manage sites’ access to your microphone:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Microphone.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Ask before accessing (recommended).

   You can also set which microphone you wish Opera to use by default, if
   you have more than one connected to your computer. Use the dropdown
   menus to set your microphone preferences.

Manage MIDI access in pages

   If you connect a musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) device to
   your computer, such as a keyboard or controller, some sites and web
   apps may ask to have exclusive access to the device. For example, a
   developer may make a new synthesizer available on the web that you can
   use with your keyboard.

   When the site has exclusive access, other apps (both on the web and on
   your computer) may fail to receive output from your device.

   By default, Opera will always ask you to allow a site to have exclusive
   access your MIDI device. Opera will remember your sharing choice if the
   site is secured through an HTTPS connection.

   To always allow or deny sites’ exclusive access to your MIDI devices:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click MIDI devices.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Ask when a site wants to use system
       exclusive messages to access MIDI devices (recommended).

Manage desktop notifications

   Desktop notifications allow websites and apps to display information
   about their service’s activities or status. These notifications display
   on your computer’s desktop even when the browser is minimized. They can
   alert you to things like new emails, special coupon offers, or if
   comments are posted to your blog.

   You can control how sites deliver notifications. By default, Opera asks
   you if you’d like a site to notify you. You can choose to allow or deny
   the site to display notifications, and Opera will remember your choice
   for future visits to that site.

   To manage desktop notifications:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Notifications.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Ask before sending (recommended).

   Click the Add button to set site-specific preferences.

Manage saved passwords

   When you log in to a website, Opera gives you the option to save your
   password. If you click Never, that site will be added to Opera’s never
   saved list.

   By default, Opera will offer to save your passwords. To disable this
   offering:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Passwords and forms, click Manage passwords.
    4. At the top, turn off Offer to save passwords.

   [password-manager.png]

   To view details or to remove your passwords, click the menu next to a
   website.

   When entering a username and password for a website, Opera will ask if
   you wish to save the password in your password manager.

   Click Save to save the password for this website in your password
   manager.

   Click Never to decline saving your password for this website.

   Click the X to close the window. Opera will ask again the next time you
   log in to the website.

   To remove passwords individually:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, then click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Autofill, click Passwords.
    4. Click the three-dot menu next to the password you want to remove,
       then click Remove.

   To remove all passwords:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, then click Privacy & security.
    3. Click Clear browsing data.
    4. In the pop-up window, click Advanced.
    5. Select the Passwords and other sign-in data box (leave everything
       else unselected), then click Clear data.

Manage pop-ups and redirects in pages

   Opera will try to distinguish pop-ups that you have requested (login
   pages, for example) from pop-ups launched automatically from websites,
   such as advertising.

   By default, Opera will block pop-ups you have not requested. You can
   control how Opera handles pop-ups.

   To change pop-up settings:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Pop-ups and redirects.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Allowed.

   Click the Add button to set site-specific preferences.

Security and privacy

Ad blocker

   In order to use Opera’s built-in ad blocker, the feature must first be
   enabled in the browser. To enable Opera’s ad blocker, or to turn off ad
   blocker:
    1. Open Opera and go to Settings.
    2. Under Block ads, click the switch. This will enable ad blocker.

   The blue ad blocker badge  on the right side of the combined address
   and search bar shows that the feature is enabled. The badge has no
   color when ad blocker is disabled.

   Click the ad blocker icon to open the ad blocker pop-up window. In this
   window you can disable ad blocker, see how many blocked ads there are
   on the currently open webpage or in your browsing history, find a link
   to the speed test, and find a link to the settings page for ad blocker.

Whitelist a website in Opera’s ad blocker

   Some websites request that you disable ad blocker so you can visit and
   fully enjoy their webpage. Instead of having to completely turn off
   Opera’s ad blocker to visit one site, you can whitelist the requesting
   website.

   To do this, open the ad blocker pop-up window in the combined address
   and search bar and click the switch. This will stop ad blocker on that
   site.

   Opera’s ad blocker pauses when you visit a whitelisted website and
   resumes when you navigate to another website, allowing for an
   uninterrupted browsing experience.

   The whitelisted website’s domain is added to your ad blocking
   exceptions list. Read below to learn how to manage exceptions for
   Opera’s ad blocker.

Managing filter lists for Opera’s ad blocker

   You can choose which filter lists Opera’s ad blocker uses when the
   feature is enabled. EasyList and NoCoin are enabled by default. To
   manage lists in Opera’s ad blocker:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Under Block ads, click Manage lists.
    3. Check the boxes next to the lists you want enabled for ad blocker.

   Opera updates your selected lists automatically. You can update the
   lists manually by clicking the Update button at the top of the page.

   These lists, also known as filter lists, contain rules that tell ad
   blockers which content is likely to be an ad. The most popular and
   commonly used list for removing ads on international websites is
   EasyList. Opera includes additional lists, such as EasyPrivacy, NoCoin,
   and lists for multiple languages, in order to remove ads.

   NoCoin is a cryptocurrency mining protection filter list which stops
   crytpojacking scripts from running on your computer. Read more about
   Opera’s cryptocurrency mining protection.

   Learn how to turn ad blocker on or off.

VPN

   Normally, your browser connects directly to websites, allowing websites
   to identify your IP address and approximate location. With VPN, you
   connect to websites via a VPN (virtual private network) server. As a
   result, your apparent location changes to the location of the server.
   To enable VPN:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Features.
    3. Under VPN, turn on Enable VPN.

   When you enable VPN, it starts automatically, and the blue VPN badge
   appears in the combined address and search bar. Click on the badge, and
   you will see an on/off switch, information about the amount of data
   transferred, the virtual location, and the virtual IP address.

   From the point of view of websites, your browser is now located in the
   region given by the virtual location. To change your virtual location,
   select a region from the list. If you do not choose a region, you are
   automatically assigned an optimal location. To turn off VPN, flip the
   switch in the badge.

   Because the connection from your browser to the VPN server is
   encrypted, even if the local network is not, VPN enhances your privacy
   on the local network. You can hide your browsing activities from other
   users of that network.

   To enhance your privacy with regard to websites, making it more
   difficult for them to track you, you need a combination of features.
   The issue is cookies. Even if you disguise your location, websites can
   still identify you if they have set a cookie. Notice, however, that
   by blocking ads you block the source of many tracking cookie. At the
   end of a private browsing session, when you close the browser, all
   cookies from that session are deleted.

   VPN is a free service, and the amount of data you are allowed to
   transfer is unlimited.

Private window

   Private browsing ensures that your internet history and activity data
   is removed as soon as you close all private windows.
     * To browse privately on Windows and Linux, go to Menu > New private
       window.
     * To browse privately on Mac, select File > New Private Window.

   When you close all private windows, Opera will clear the following
   associated data:
     * Browsing history
     * Items in cache
     * Cookies

   After being closed, a private tab or window cannot be recovered from
   the Recently Closed list in the tab menu.

   While private windows do not leave any record of the websites you
   visit, if you deliberately save data – for example, if you save an item
   to your Speed Dial, save a password, or download a file – it will still
   be visible after the window is closed.

Clear browsing data

   By default, Opera stores certain browsing data to help speed up
   connections, load common page elements, and improve your interaction
   with the sites you visit. You may wish to remove traces of your
   browsing habits by clearing your browsing data. To clear browsing data:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Clear browsing data.
    4. Select a time range and the types of data you wish to clear, and
       click Clear data.

   Browsing history – A list of sites you have visited.

   Download history – A record of the files you’ve downloaded. Clearing
   this will not delete the file you downloaded, only the record of where
   and when.

   News usage data – Information on the frequency and the length of time
   you spend on a news article from the personal news page, which is used
   to customize what news you see.

   Cookies and other site data – Data from websites you visit which is
   stored on your computer, such as site preferences and login status.

   Cached images and files – Data stored on your computer by applications
   or websites to make processes and site loading faster. Should be
   cleared periodically.

   Passwords and other sign-in data – Data related to logging into
   websites and applications. Allows you to be signed-in automatically.

   Autofill form data – Information like credit-card numbers, names and
   phone numbers, which you can choose to store on your computer in order
   to have forms filled in automatically.

   Site settings – Permission data for websites, such as whether they can
   access your microphone or send you cookies.

   Hosted app data – Data stored by extensions you have installed in your
   browser. Clearing this data will reset the extension to its default.

   Clearing your browsing history will delete any stored location
   information about the pages you have viewed and the times you accessed
   them.

   Clearing download history will empty Opera’s record of the files you’ve
   downloaded through the browser. This will not delete the file from your
   local machine, only the record of when and where you downloaded it.

   Deleting cookies and other site data will remove any tracked site
   data. Read more about managing cookies here.

   Emptying your browser’s cache will delete any temporarily stored data
   from websites. The cache is used to briefly store page elements such as
   images or search queries. Cached data also helps reduce loading times
   when you wish to access a recently visited site. Emptying cache will
   clear up space on you local disk.

   Clearing data from hosted apps will delete any data stored by
   extensions you have installed in the browser. For example, if you
   installed a weather extension on Speed Dial and set your location in
   its settings, clearing this data will reset the extension to its
   default and you will have to tell the extension your location again.
   Note: Take care not to erase useful data inadvertently. If you are not
   already familiar with it, try private browsing. The data for private
   browsing is automatically cleared when you close all private windows.

   Managing how Opera stores private data may be useful, as an alternative
   to clearing all private data. Read more about setting web preferences.

Security badges

   Opera warns you about suspicious pages by checking the page you request
   against a database of known phishing and malware websites. To protect
   yourself when entering sensitive information, always look for the  lock
   in the security badge to the left of the combined address and search
   bar.

   Badges indicate details about the page you are viewing. When a badge
   appears in your combined address and search bar, click it to see more
   information, including security certificates and more.
   Icon        Indicates…
        Compressed connection
        Ads are blocked
        Camera access
        Extension
        Fraud or malware warning
        Local file
        Location access
        Microphone access
        Opera page
        Secure connection
        Unprotected connection
        MIDI access
        VPN is on

   When the connection is secure, a lock is displayed in the security
   badge, implying that no one else can read the information that passes
   between you and the site. Opera uses certificates to verify the
   identity of the site owners. A lock means there is good encryption
   between you and the recipient, and the recipient’s identity has been
   verified.

   If a website is blacklisted, you will be presented with a warning page,
   and you can decide whether to visit the website or to go back safely to
   the previous page. Fraud and malware protection does not cause any
   delay in the opening of pages.

Unblock and allow insecure content

   If you are browsing on an encrypted connection (https://), Opera will
   check to ensure that all parts of the site are encrypted. If Opera
   detects that any live elements of the page, for example scripts,
   plugins, or frames, are being served by an open connection (http://),
   it will block the insecure content. This means parts of the page may
   not display properly.

   Opera advises against allowing insecure content to load into an
   encrypted connection. The best way to protect your sensitive
   information is to interact only with secure content. When Opera detects
   insecure content and blocks it, a warning will appear on the right side
   of the combined address and search bar.

   If you do not care about the security of your connection with the site,
   you can click the warning to show an Unblock button. This button will
   allow the blocked content to be loaded onto the page, and the security
   badge will change to show an open padlock, reminding you that you’ve
   allowed insecure content to display on an encrypted connection.

Manage security certificates

   HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a widely used technology
   that provides encrypted communication and identity assurance on the
   Internet. Security certificates are used to verify the ownership of
   Internet domains. If you see a green padlock security badge in your
   combined address and search bar, then according to your operating
   system’s configuration, you are securely connected to the website.
   However, it is still your responsibility to make sure that the address
   is correct. When in doubt, type the address by hand.

   If you’d like more information about a site’s security certificate,
   click on the security badge and click the Certificate (Valid) link.
   Opera will provide the certificate’s issuer, the type of certificate,
   and whether the issuer is publicly-known and valid.

   Publicly-known issuers and their certificates are validated against a
   number of security and identity checks. Opera will warn you if some
   part of a publicly-known issuer’s certificate is questionable. You may
   choose to proceed but Opera cannot guarantee your security.

   To see which HTTPS/TLS certificates are used by your Opera browser and
   how Opera handles them:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Manage certificates.

A note about local certificate issuers

   Some connections can be certified by certificates from local issuers,
   either from apps on your machine or other non-public sources (such as a
   local intranet). These issuers can be used to verify secured
   connections in the browser. Most of these connections are valid. For
   example, debugging applications, third-party security scanning, and
   parental filters may rely on locally-issued certificates.

   Connections certified by certificates from local issuers aren’t
   screened by the same security standards as publicly-known issuers and
   certificates. Such screening is too strict and may not allow
   connections to work as intended. Malware or viruses may use these
   certificates to view encrypted information or inject ads.

   If you wish, you can configure Opera to warn you about public sites
   that use certificates from local issuers. If you continue to browse on
   these connections, be aware that some security measures, such as
   certificate pinning and Certificate Transparency, will be disabled for
   all such connections during your browsing session.

   Review how to manage security certificates.

Invalid certificate warnings in Opera

   Invalid certificate pop-up in Opera

   If Opera cannot verify the identity of the server for a website you
   wish to visit, you will see this pop-up. Click Show certificate to
   review the certificate yourself. When reviewing the certificate, check
   that the certificate’s validity date is current and that the issuer of
   the certificate is trusted.

   Click Continue anyway to proceed to the website.

   If you do not trust the server or the certificate and you wish to not
   proceed to the website, click Cancel.

A note about Extended Validation (EV) certificates

   The best guarantee of a website’s identity is provided by Extended
   Validation (EV) certificates. Extended Validation means that the
   details of the organization buying the certificate have been audited by
   an accountable, third-party entity, who can therefore verify that the
   certificate owner is who it claims to be. EV websites are indicated by
   a green security badge with a padlock in the address field.

   Extended Validation certificates are designed to endorse a company’s
   validity as a reliable, rather than transient, business. For example,
   to obtain a certificate, a company must provide three years of tax
   records and other financial information to the Certificate Authority.
   This certification provides peace of mind and security for Internet
   shoppers.

   Opera has already implemented procedures and processes for EV
   certification and is at the forefront of complying with standards. We
   have built-in procedures to automatically verify that everything in a
   certificate for a website is correct when someone visits a page on the
   site and that the certificate has not been revoked.

Tell sites to not track your activity

   Most sites track your behavior while you visit them. If you do not like
   this idea, Opera can send an additional header with every request:
   “DNT: 1”. This is a flag to websites that the user does not want to be
   tracked. Some countries have DNT legislation that will legally protect
   your request and most well-behaved websites will respect this
   additional header.

   You can set Opera to tell sites you prefer to opt-out of online
   behavioral tracking. To set this:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, turn on Send a “Do Not Track” request
       with your browsing traffic.

A note about phishing and malware

   Opera’s fraud and malware Protection warns you about suspicious web
   pages and is enabled by default. It checks the requested page against
   several databases of known phishing and malware websites, called
   blacklists. Although it is not possible to totally eliminate the risk
   of encountering an unidentified phishing or malware website, the risk
   is minimized.

   Note that checking against the database does not delay the opening of
   web pages.

Phishing

   The growth of Internet commerce has given online criminals an
   opportunity to steal your passwords, your credit card numbers, and
   other personal information by impersonating authority figures from your
   bank or other institutions you frequent. This is known as phishing.

   You will be encouraged to log in and “verify” your customer
   information: in other words, to reveal your password, credit card
   number, or other private data. The best defense against this threat is
   to be aware of the problem and to be alert when transacting business
   online.

Malware

   For the same reason that you have anti-virus software installed, you
   may want protection from websites that distribute viruses or other
   malicious software, collectively known as malware. The concept of
   malware encompasses not just viruses, but also scripts that may run
   automatically when you load a web page.

Předvolby webu

Povolení automatického vyplňování

   Povolíte-li funkci automatického vyplňování, Opera se za vás pokusí
   vyplnit běžné webové formuláře včetně údajů o vaší adrese či kreditní
   kartě.

   Chcete-li povolit automatické vyplňování:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Automatické vyplňování zaškrtněte volbu Povolit automatické
       vyplňování formulářů na webových stránkách.

   Opera může uložit údaje o více kontaktech či více kreditních kartách.
   Chcete-li do Opery přidat kontakt či kreditní kartu k použití při
   automatickém vyplňování formulářů, klepněte na tlačítko Správce

   nějakou položku odstraníte, Opera již příslušné informace nebude
   vyplňovat do formulářů.

Správa přístupu stránek ke kameře

   Vývojáři nacházejí nové možnosti využití webových kamer pomocí
   moderních prohlížečů. Některé weby vás mohou požádat o přístup ke
   kameře vašeho počítače.

   Ve výchozím nastavení se vás Opera vždy dotáže, zda chcete webu povolit
   přístup k vaší kameře. Opera si zapamatuje vaši volbu sdílení, je-li
   web zabezpečen pomocí připojení HTTPS.

   Chcete-li webům vždy zakázat přístup k vaší kameře:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Kamera vyberte volbu Zakázat webům přístup ke kameře.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

   Máte-li k vašemu počítači připojeno více zařízení, lze rovněž nastavit,
   kterou kameru má Opera používat jako výchozí. K nastavení vaší
   předvolby pro kameru použijte rozbalovací menu.

Správa cookies na stránkách

   Cookies jsou malé datové soubory obsahující informaci spojenou s
   určitým webem. Cookie může například uchovávat informaci o obsahu
   vašeho nákupního košíku nebo osvědčovat vaše přihlášení pod zvolenou
   identitou při návštěvě stránek určitého webu.

   Cookies mohou být použity ke sledování vašich návyků při prohlížení
   webu a mohou proto představovat ohrožení soukromí.

Nastavení zacházení s cookies

   Nastavení předvoleb vám umožní ovládat, jak bude Opera s cookies
   zacházet. Ve výchozím nastavení je povoleno přijímat všechny cookies.

   Chcete-li nastavit zacházení s cookies:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Cookies vyberte volbu pro nakládání s cookies.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

Správa obsluhy odkazů

   Některé weby vás mohou ve výchozím nastavení žádat o povolení k
   otevírání zvláštních druhů odkazů. Toto nazýváme obsluha protokolů.
   Například můžete Operu nastavit, aby otevírala odkazy ical: ve webové
   aplikaci Google Calendar nebo ji přinutit, aby odkazy mailto: otevírala
   ve vaší e-mailové webové aplikaci.

   Chcete-li zabránit, aby vás weby žádaly o povolení být výchozími pro
   obsluhu zvláštních druhů odkazů:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Obsluha protokolů zvolte Zakázat webům obsluhu protokolů.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správa obsluhy nastavíte předvolby platné jen pro
   určitý web.

Správa obrázků na stránkách

   Je možné nastavit, jak bude Opera zacházet s obrázky na prohlížených
   stránkách. Můžete si vybrat, zda chcete zobrazovat veškeré obrázky nebo
   ne, případně zvolit nastavení nakládání s obrázky platné jen pro určitý
   web.

   Chcete-li nastavení obrázků změnit:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Obrázky vyberte volbu pro nakládání s obrázky.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

Správa JavaScriptu na stránkách

   JavaScript je skriptovací jazyk používaný pro obohacení stránek o
   některé funkce, například manipulaci s okny prohlížeče. Vzácně může být
   JavaScript zneužit k provedení akcí, které mohou být pro uživatele
   obtěžující. V takových případech je možné jej zcela vypnout. Pokud tak
   učiníte, některé webové stránky nemusí pracovat korektně.

   Chcete-li nastavení pro JavaScript změnit:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci JavaScript vyberte volbu pro nakládání se skripty v jazyce
       JavaScript.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

Správa sdílení zeměpisné polohy na stránkách

   Některé weby vás mohou požádat o využití údajů o vaší zeměpisné poloze
   pro poskytování lokalizovaných služeb, například recenze nedalekých
   obchodů či kupóny z podniků nacházejících se ve vaší oblasti. Aby bylo
   možné s těmito údaji pracovat, tyto weby vás mohou požádat o povolení
   zjišťovat vaši zeměpisnou polohu prostřednictvím otevřené stránky. Při
   prohlížení webu si můžete vybrat, zda chcete sdílet vaši zeměpisnou
   polohu či nikoli. Opera nebude sdílet tyto údaje bez vašeho svolení.

   Nastavení pro sdílení zeměpisné polohy vám umožňuje ovládat přístup
   webů k vašim geolokačním údajům. Ve výchozím nastavení budete poprvé,
   kdy navštívíte web požadující vaše geolokační údaje, dotázáni, zda
   chcete vaši zeměpisnou polohu sdílet. Můžete povolit či zakázat přístup
   k údajům o vaší poloze a Opera si vaši volbu zapamatuje i pro příští
   návštěvy daného webu.

   Chcete-li spravovat sdílení zeměpisné polohy:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Zeměpisná poloha vyberte volbu pro sdílení údajů o vaší
       zeměpisné poloze.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

   Více informací o zeměpisné poloze a sdílení zeměpisné polohy.

Správa přístupu stránek k mikrofónu

   Některé weby a webové aplikace vás mohou požádat o přístup k mikrofónu
   vašeho počítače. Například aplikace umožňující živý chat může chtít
   využít váš mikrofón, abyste mohli hovořit s jinými lidmi
   prostřednictvím této služby.

   Ve výchozím nastavení se vás Opera vždy dotáže, zda chcete webu povolit
   přístup k vašemu mikrofónu. Opera si zapamatuje vaši volbu sdílení,
   je-li web zabezpečen pomocí připojení HTTPS.

   Chcete-li webům vždy zakázat přístup k vašemu mikrofónu:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Mikrofón vyberte volbu Zakázat webům přístup k mikrofónu.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

   Máte-li k vašemu počítači připojeno více zařízení, lze rovněž nastavit,
   který mikrofón má Opera používat jako výchozí. K nastavení vaší
   předvolby pro mikrofón použijte rozbalovací menu.

Správa přístupu stránek k MIDI

   Pokud připojíte zařízení MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) k
   vašemu počítači, například klávesy nebo kontrolér, některé weby a
   webové aplikace po vás mohou vyžadovat výhradní přístup k tomuto
   zařízení. Například vývojář může zpřístupnit na webu nový syntetizér,
   který lze použít s vašimi klávesami.

   Má-li web výhradní přístup, jiné aplikace (webové i z vašeho lokálního
   počítače) nemusí být schopné přijímat výstupy z vašeho zařízení.

   Ve výchozím nastavení se vás aplikace Opera vždy zeptá, chcete-li webu
   udělit výhradní přístup k vašemu zařízení MIDI. Opera si zapamatuje
   vaši volbu sdílení, je-li web zabezpečen pomocí připojení HTTPS.

   Chcete-li webům vždy povolit či zakázat výhradní přístup k vašim
   zařízením MIDI:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Úplné ovládání MIDI vyberte vaši volbu, jak mají weby
       přistupovat k vašim zařízením MIDI.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Výjimky nastavíte předvolby platné jen pro určitý
   web.

Správa oznámení na ploše

   Oznámení na ploše umožňují webům a aplikacím zobrazovat údaje o stavu
   či aktivitách jejich služeb. Tato oznámení se zobrazí na ploše vašeho
   počítače i tehdy, je-li váš prohlížeč minimalizován. Oznámení vás mohou
   upozornit např. na nové zprávy, speciální akční nabídky či na komentáře
   k vašemu blogu.

   Můžete si nastavit způsob, jakým weby budou posílat svá oznámení. Při
   výchozí volbě se vás Opera zeptá, zda si přejete, aby vám weby posílaly
   oznámení. Můžete si vybrat, zda chcete povolit či zakázat danému webu
   zobrazovat oznámení a Opera si vaši volbu zapamatuje i pro příští
   návštěvy.

   Chcete-li spravovat oznámení na ploše:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Oznámení vyberte volbu pro zobrazení oznámení na ploše.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

Správce uložených hesel

   Pokud se přihlásíte k některému webu, Opera vám nabídne možnost uložení
   vašeho hesla. Zvolíte-li možnost Nikdy, bude daný web přidán na seznam
   webů, pro které nebudou přihlašovací údaje nikdy ukládány. Ukládaná
   hesla lze spravovat ve Správci hesel.

   Ve výchozím nastavení Opera nabízí uložení vašich hesel. Chcete-li tuto
   nabídku vypnout:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Hesla zrušte zaškrtnutí volby Nabízet ukládání hesel
       zadávaných na webových stránkách.

   Chcete-li zobrazit vaše hesla na počítačích Mac:
    1. Přejděte na Předvolby.
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Hesla klepněte na volbu Zobrazit hesla.

   Chcete-li zobrazit vaše hesla na počítačích s OS Windows nebo Linux:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení.
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Hesla klepněte na tlačítko Správce uložených hesel.

   Mac: Chcete-li smazat některé heslo z paměti vašeho počítače či dále
   spravovat uložená hesla, použijte vaši systémovou Klíčenku.


Správa automaticky otevíraných oken na stránkách

   Opera se pokusí rozlišovat u automaticky otevíraných oken, zda jde o
   reakci na požadavek uživatele (např. přihlašovací stránky) či okna
   otevíraná automaticky webovými stránkami, například reklamy.

   Ve výchozím nastavení Opera blokuje vámi nevyžádaná automaticky
   otevíraná okna. Můžete však nastavit, jak bude Opera s automaticky
   otevíranými okny nakládat.

   Chcete-li nastavení pro automaticky otevíraná okna změnit:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Automaticky otevíraná okna vyberte volbu pro nakládání s
       automaticky otevíranými okny.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

Webeinstellungen

Autofill aktivieren

   Wenn Sie Autofill aktivieren, kann Opera für Sie online allgemeine
   Formulare ausfüllen, einschließlich Ihrer Adress- oder
   Kreditkarteninformationen.

   So aktivieren Sie Autofill:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Aktivieren Sie unter Autofill das Kontrollkästchen Automatisches
       Ausfüllen von Formularen auf Webseiten aktivieren.

   Sie können mehrere Kontaktkarten oder Kreditkarten auf Opera speichern.
   Um eine Kontakt- oder Kreditkarte hinzuzufügen, die Opera beim
   automatischen Ausfüllen von Formularen verwenden soll, klicken Sie auf
   die Schaltfläche Einstellungen für Autofill verwalten.

   Ihre Kontakt- oder Kreditkarteninformationen können später bearbeitet
   oder gelöscht werden. Bewegen Sie den Mauszeiger über die Karte und
   wählen Sie Bearbeiten oder x. Wenn Sie ein Eintrag entfernen, füllt
   Opera Formulare mit diesen Informationen nicht mehr automatisch aus.

Kamerazugriff auf den Seiten verwalten

   Entwickler finden neue Möglichkeiten zur Steuerung von Webcams durch
   moderne Browser. Einige Seiten bitten möglicherweise um Zugriff auf die
   Kamera Ihres Computers.

   Standardmäßig fordert Opera Sie immer auf, einer Seite den Zugriff auf
   Ihre Kamera zu erlauben. Opera wird sich an Ihre Freigabeauswahl
   erinnern, wenn die Seite über eine HTTPS-Verbindung gesichert ist.

   So verweigern Sie Seiten immer den Zugriff auf Ihre Kamera:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Kamera die Option Seiten dürfen nicht auf meine
       Kamera zugreifen.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

   Sie können auch festlegen, welche Kamera Opera standardmäßig verwenden
   soll, wenn Sie mehr als eine Kamera mit Ihrem Computer verbunden haben.
   Verwenden Sie das Dropdown-Menü, um Ihre Kameraeinstellungen
   festzulegen.

Cookies in den Seiten verwalten

   Cookies sind kleine Dateien, die Informationen in Verbindung mit einer
   Webseite speichern. Beispielsweise kann ein Cookie erstellt werden, um
   den Inhalt eines Einkaufskorbs zu speichern oder um zu bestätigen, dass
   Sie beim Surfen der Seiten einer Webseite angemeldet sind.

   Cookies können verwendet werden, um ein Profil Ihrer Surfgewohnheiten
   zu erstellen und werden daher von einigen als Datenschutzproblem
   angesehen.

Ihre Cookie-Einstellungen festlegen

   Wenn Sie Einstellungen festlegen, können Sie steuern, wie Opera mit
   Cookies umgeht. Die Standardeinstellung lautet, alle Cookies zu
   akzeptieren.

   So legen Sie Ihre Cookie-Einstellungen fest:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Cookies eine Option zum Umgang mit Cookies.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

Verwalten, wie Verknüpfungen verarbeitet werden

   Einige Seiten werden möglicherweise gebeten, bestimmte Linktypen
   standardmäßig zu öffnen. Diese werden Protokollhandler genannt. Sie
   können Opera beispielsweise so einstellen, dass ical: -Links in der
   Google Kalender-Webanwendung geöffnet werden, oder erzwingen, dass
   mailto: -Links in Ihrer E-Mail-Webanwendung geöffnet werden.

   So verhindern Sie, dass Seiten standardmäßig nach spezifischen Handlern
   bestimmter Linktypen gefragt werden:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Handler die Option Keiner Webseite zulassen,
       Protokolle zu verarbeiten.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Handler verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

Bilder auf Seiten verwalten

   Sie können steuern, wie Opera mit Bildern auf den von Ihnen angezeigten
   Seiten umgeht. Sie können festlegen, ob alle Bilder angezeigt werden
   sollen oder nicht, und Sie können auch standortspezifische
   Bildeinstellungen festlegen.

   So ändern Sie die Bildeinstellungen:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Bilder eine Option zum Umgang mit Bildern.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

JavaScript auf Seiten verwalten

   JavaScript ist eine Skriptsprache, mit der Funktionen zu Seiten
   hinzugefügt werden, z. B. zur Bearbeitung von Browserfenstern. In
   seltenen Fällen kann JavaScript aufdringlich verwendet werden, um
   bestimmte Aktionen durchzuführen, die Sie als störend empfinden
   könnten. In diesen Fällen können Sie es vollständig deaktivieren. Wenn
   Sie dies tun, funktionieren einige Seiten nicht wie vorgesehen.

   So ändern Sie die JavaScript-Einstellungen:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter JavaScript eine Option zum Umgang mit JavaScript.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

Verwalten der Standortfreigabe auf Seiten

   Einige Seiten werden Sie möglicherweise darum bitten, Ihren Standort zu
   verwenden, um lokalisierte Funktionen bereitzustellen, z. B.
   Erfahrungsberichte von Geschäften in der Nähe oder Gutscheine von
   Unternehmen in Ihrer Region. Um dies zu tun, bittet diese Seite Sie
   möglicherweise dazu, Geolokalisierung auf der Seite zuzulassen. Sie
   können wählen, ob Sie Ihren Standort beim Surfen freigeben möchten oder
   nicht. Opera wird diese Informationen nicht ohne Ihre Erlaubnis teilen.

   Wenn Sie die Einstellungen für die Standortfreigabe festlegen, können
   Sie steuern, wie Seiten auf Ihren Standort zugreifen. Opera fragt
   standardmäßig, ob Sie Ihren Standort beim ersten Besuch einer Webseite,
   die ihn anfordert, freigeben möchten. Sie können den Zugriff auf Ihren
   Standort zulassen oder verweigern und Opera merkt sich Ihre Auswahl für
   zukünftige Besuche auf dieser Seite.

   So verwalten Sie Ihre Standortfreigabeeinstellungen:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Standort eine Option für die Freigabe Ihres
       Standorts aus.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

   Lesen Sie mehr über Geolokalisierung und Standortfreigabe.

Mikrofonzugriff auf den Seiten verwalten

   Einige Seiten und Webanwendungen bitten möglicherweise um Zugriff auf
   das Mikrofon Ihres Computers. Zum Beispiel könnte eine Live-Chat-App
   Ihr Mikrofon verwenden, damit Sie über Ihren Dienst mit einer anderen
   Person sprechen können.

   Standardmäßig fordert Opera Sie immer auf, einer Seite den Zugriff auf
   Ihr Mikrofon zu erlauben. Opera wird sich an Ihre Freigabeauswahl
   erinnern, wenn die Seite über eine HTTPS-Verbindung gesichert ist.

   So verweigern Sie Seiten immer den Zugriff auf Ihr Mikrofon:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Mikrofon die Option Webseiten dürfen nicht auf
       mein Mikrofon zugreifen.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

   Sie können auch festlegen, welches Mikrofon Opera standardmäßig
   verwenden soll, wenn Sie mehr als eine Kamera mit Ihrem Computer
   verbunden haben. Verwenden Sie die Dropdown-Menüs, um Ihre
   Mikrofoneinstellungen festzulegen.

MIDI-Zugriff auf den Seiten verwalten

   Wenn Sie ein MIDI-Gerät (Digital Instrument Interface) eines
   Musikinstruments an Ihren Computer anschließen, z. B. eine Tastatur
   oder einen Controller, fragen einige Seiten und Webanwendungen
   möglicherweise nach exklusivem Zugriff auf das Gerät. Zum Beispiel kann
   ein Entwickler einen neuen Synthesizer im Internet verfügbar machen,
   den Sie mit Ihrer Tastatur verwenden können.

   Wenn die Webseite exklusiven Zugriff hat, erhalten andere Apps (sowohl
   im Web als auch auf Ihrem Computer) möglicherweise keine Ausgabe von
   Ihrem Gerät.

   Standardmäßig fordert Opera Sie immer auf, einer Seite den Zugriff auf
   Ihr MIDI-Gerät zu erlauben. Opera wird sich an Ihre Freigabeauswahl
   erinnern, wenn die Seite über eine HTTPS-Verbindung gesichert ist.

   So erlauben oder verweigern Sie Seiten immer exklusiven Zugriff auf
   Ihre MIDI-Geräte:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter MIDI-Vollzugriff, wie Sie auf Ihr MIDI-Gerät
       zugreifen möchten.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

Desktopbenachrichtigungen verwalten

   Mithilfe von Desktopbenachrichtigungen können Webseiten und Apps
   Informationen über die Aktivitäten oder den Status Ihres Dienstes
   anzeigen. Diese Benachrichtigungen werden auch dann auf dem Desktop
   Ihres Computers angezeigt, wenn der Browser minimiert ist. Sie können
   Sie auf neue E-Mails, spezielle Gutscheinangebote oder auf Kommentare
   zu Ihrem Blog aufmerksam machen.

   Sie können steuern, wie Seiten Benachrichtigungen zustellen. Opera
   fragt Sie standardmäßig, ob Sie möchten, dass eine Webseite Sie
   benachrichtigt. Sie können das Anzeigen von Benachrichtigungen durch
   die Webseite zulassen oder verweigern und Opera merkt sich Ihre Auswahl
   für zukünftige Besuche auf dieser Seite.

   Desktopbenachrichtigungen verwalten
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Benachrichtigungen eine Option zum Anzeigen von
       Desktopbenachrichtigungen aus.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

Gespeicherte Passwörter verwalten

   Wenn Sie sich auf einer Webseite anmelden, bietet Opera Ihnen die
   Möglichkeit, Ihr Passwort zu speichern. Wenn Sie auf Nie klicken, wird
   diese Seite zur nie gespeicherten Liste von Opera hinzugefügt.
   Gespeicherte Passwörter werden im Passwortmanager verwaltet.

   Standardmäßig bietet Opera an, Ihre Passwörter zu speichern. So
   deaktivieren Sie dieses Angebot:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Deaktivieren Sie unter Passwörter das Kontrollkästchen Die
       Speicherung von Passwörtern die Ich im Internet eingebe anbieten.

   Ihre Passwörter auf Mac anzeigen:
    1. Ehen Sie zu Präferenzen.
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Klicken Sie unter Passwörter auf  Passwörter anzeigen.

   Ihre Passwörter auf Windows oder Linux anzeigen:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen.
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Klicken Sie unter Passwörter auf die Schaltfläche Gespeicherte
       Passwörter verwalten.

   Für Mac-Nutzern: Um ein Passwort aus dem Speicher Ihres Computers zu
   löschen oder gespeicherte Passwörter weiter zu verwalten, verwenden Sie
   den Schlüsselbund Ihres Systems.


Pop-ups in Seiten verwalten

   Opera wird versuchen, Pop-ups, die Sie angefordert haben (z. B.
   Anmeldeseiten), von Pop-ups zu unterscheiden, die automatisch von
   Webseiten aufgerufen werden, wie z. B. Werbung.

   Standardmäßig blockiert Opera Pop-ups, die Sie nicht angefordert haben.
   Sie können steuern, wie Opera mit Pop-ups umgeht.

   So ändern Sie die Popup-Einstellungen:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Pop-ups eine Option zur Bearbeitung von
       Popup-Fenstern.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

Preferencje przeglądania

Włączanie automatycznego uzupełniania

   Jeśli włączysz automatyczne uzupełnianie, Opera będzie automatycznie
   wypełniać typowe formularze internetowe informacjami, takimi jak adres
   lub dane karty kredytowej.

   Aby włączyć automatyczne uzupełnianie:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. W sekcji Automatyczne uzupełnianie możesz wybrać, które formy
            mają być uzupełnianie automatycznie.

   Możesz zapisać w Operze wiele zestawów danych adresowych i danych kart
   kredytowych. Aby dodać dane adresowe lub dane karty kredytowej, które
   mają być wykorzystywane przez Operę do automatycznego uzupełniania
   formularzy, wybierz rodzaj danych (forma płatności lub adresy i
   ustawienia) i kliknij przycisk Dodaj.

   Dane adresowe lub informacje o karcie kredytowej możesz później
   edytować lub usunąć. Wystarczy umieścić wskaźnik myszy na karcie i
   wybrać przycisk Edytuj lub x. Jeśli usuniesz element, Opera nie będzie
   więcej automatycznie uzupełniać formularzy tymi informacjami.

Zarządzanie dostępem do kamery na stronach

   Programiści odkrywają nowe możliwości sterowania kamerami internetowymi
   za pomocą nowoczesnych przeglądarek. Niektóre witryny mogą próbować
   uzyskać dostęp do kamery Twojego komputera.

   Domyślnie Opera zawsze pyta, czy chcesz udostępnić witrynie kamerę.
   Opera będzie pamiętać Twój wybór, jeśli witryna jest zabezpieczona
   połączeniem HTTPS.

   Aby zarządzać dostępem stron do kamery:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. W sekcji Ustawienia witryny wybierz opcję Kamera i zarządzaj
            dostępem do kamery.

   Jeśli masz do komputera podłączonych wiele kamer, możesz również
   określić, która z nich ma być domyślnie używana przez Operę. Do
   ustawienia preferencji kamery użyj menu rozwijanego.

Zarządzanie ciasteczkami na stronach

   Ciasteczka są małymi plikami przechowującymi informacje związane z
   witrynami internetowymi. Ciasteczko może zostać utworzone np. w celu
   przechowywania zawartości koszyka zakupów lub informacji o zalogowaniu
   podczas przeglądania stron witryny.

   Ciasteczka mogą być wykorzystywane do określania profilu potrzeb i
   przyzwyczajeń użytkownika, dlatego też część użytkowników uważa je za
   potencjalne źródło problemów związanych z prywatnością.

Ustawianie preferencji ciasteczek

   Skonfigurowanie ustawień ciasteczek daje kontrolę nad sposobem ich
   obsługi przez Operę. Domyślnie przeglądarka akceptuje wszystkie
   ciasteczka.

   Aby określić preferencje ciasteczek:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. W obszarze Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo kliknij Ustawienia
            witryny.
         4. W sekcji Ciasteczka wybierz sposób obsługi ciasteczek.

   Istnieją dwie dodatkowe opcje obsługi plików cookie:
     * Przechowuj dane lokalne tylko do momentu zamknięcia przeglądarki –
       usuwa pliki cookie dodane po włączeniu tego ustawienia podczas
       zamykania przeglądarki.
     * Blokuj pliki cookie innych witryn – blokuje pliki cookie ustawione
       przez inne witryny internetowe, których zawartość jest wyświetlana
       w ramkach lub obrazach w bieżącej odwiedzanej witrynie.
       Zablokowanie plików cookie innych witryn umożliwi ustawienie w
       systemie tylko plików cookie odwiedzanej witryny.

   Kliknij przycisk Dodaj obok sekcji Blokuj, Wyczyść przy wyjściu lub
   Zezwalaj na sekcje, aby ustawić preferencje dotyczące plików cookie dla
   witryn.

   Wpisz [*.] Przed nazwą domeny, aby utworzyć wyjątek dla całej nazwy
   domeny. Utworzenie wyjątku cookie [*.] Opera.com będzie dotyczyć stron
   takich jak blogs.opera.com i addons.opera.com. Adresy IP można również
   dodawać jako wyjątki.

Zarządzanie obsługą linków

   Niektóre witryny mogą prosić, by za ich pomocą były domyślnie otwierane
   określone typy linków. Są to witryny do obsługi protokołów. Możesz na
   przykład skonfigurować Operę, aby otwierała linki ical: w aplikacji
   internetowej Kalendarz Google, lub wymusić otwieranie linków mailto: w
   wybranej internetowej aplikacji pocztowej.

   Aby witryny nie prosiły o ustawienie ich jako domyślnych witryn do
   obsługi określonych linków:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. W sekcji Ustawienia witryny wybierz Obsługa protokołów.

Zarządzanie obrazami na stronach

   Możesz określić sposób obsługi obrazów na stronach, które przeglądasz.
   Możesz zdecydować, aby wyświetlać wszystkie obrazy, nie wyświetlać
   żadnych lub obsługiwać je zgodnie z ustawieniami dla określonych
   witryn.

   Aby zmienić ustawienia obrazów:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. W obszarze Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo kliknij Ustawienia
            witryny.
         3. W sekcji Obrazy wybierz sposób obsługi obrazów.
         4. Na górze włącz lub wyłącz Pokaż wszystko (zalecane).

   Kliknij przycisk Dodaj, aby ustawić preferencje specyficzne dla
   witryny.

Zarządzanie skryptami JavaScript na stronach

   JavaScript jest językiem skryptowym umożliwiającym dodawanie do stron
   nowych funkcji, takich jak modyfikowanie okien przeglądarki. W rzadkich
   przypadkach działania wykonywane w oparciu o skrypty JavaScript mogą
   być natrętne i dokuczliwe. W takich przypadkach możesz całkowicie
   wyłączyć ich obsługę. Jeśli tak zrobisz, niektóre strony nie będą
   działać zgodnie z oczekiwaniami.

   Aby zmienić ustawienia JavaScript:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatności i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny.
         4. W sekcji JavaScript wybierz sposób obsługi skryptów
            JavaScript.

   Kliknij przycisk Dodaj, aby ustawić preferencje specyficzne dla
   witryny.

Zarządzanie udostępnianiem lokalizacji na stronach

   Niektóre witryny mogą próbować użyć informacji o Twojej lokalizacji w
   celu dostarczenia zlokalizowanych treści, takich jak recenzje z
   pobliskich sklepów lub kupony od firm znajdujących się w Twojej
   okolicy. Aby to zrobić, witryna może poprosić Cię o zezwolenie na
   użycie funkcji geolokalizacji. Możesz zdecydować, czy chcesz
   udostępniać swoją lokalizację podczas przeglądania. Opera nie ujawni
   tych informacji bez Twojej zgody.

   Skonfigurowanie odpowiednich preferencji umożliwi kontrolę nad
   udostępnianiem lokalizacji witrynom. Domyślnie Opera pyta, czy chcesz
   udostępnić swoją lokalizację, przy pierwszej wizycie w witrynie, która
   próbuje ją określić. Możesz zezwolić lub odmówić dostępu do informacji
   o swojej lokalizacji, a Opera zapamięta Twój wybór podczas przyszłych
   odwiedzin danej witryny.

   Aby zarządzać preferencjami udostępniania lokalizacji:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do Ustawień (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny > Lokalizacja.
         4. Włącz (zalecane) lub wyłącz Zapytaj przed dostępem.

Zarządzanie dostępem do mikrofonu na stronach

   Niektóre witryny i aplikacje internetowe mogą próbować uzyskać dostęp
   do mikrofonu Twojego komputera. Na przykład aplikacja typu live-chat
   może potrzebować Twojego mikrofonu, by pozwolić Ci rozmawiać z inną
   osobą za jej pośrednictwem.

   Domyślnie Opera zawsze pyta, czy chcesz udostępnić witrynie mikrofon.
   Opera będzie pamiętać Twój wybór, jeśli witryna jest zabezpieczona
   połączeniem HTTPS.

   Aby zarządzać dostępem witryny do mikrofonu:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do Ustawień (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny > Mikrofon.
         4. Włącz (zalecane) lub wyłącz Pytaj przed uzyskaniem dostępu.

   Jeśli masz do komputera podłączonych wiele mikrofonów, możesz również
   określić, który z nich ma być domyślnie używany przez Operę. Do
   ustawienia preferencji mikrofonu użyj menu rozwijanego.

Zarządzanie dostępem do urządzeń MIDI na stronach

   Jeśli podłączysz do komputera urządzenie z interfejsem MIDI, takie jak
   klawiatura lub kontroler, niektóre witryny i aplikacje internetowe mogą
   prosić o uzyskanie wyłącznego dostępu do takiego urządzenia.
   Programista może na przykład udostępnić w Internecie nowy syntezator, z
   którego możesz korzystać za pomocą swojej klawiatury.

   Gdy witryna uzyska wyłączny dostęp, inne aplikacje (zarówno
   internetowe, jak i te zainstalowane na Twoim komputerze) nie będą mogły
   odczytywać sygnałów z urządzenia.

   Domyślnie Opera zawsze pyta, czy chcesz przyznać witrynie wyłączny
   dostęp do urządzenia MIDI. Opera będzie pamiętać Twój wybór, jeśli
   witryna jest zabezpieczona połączeniem HTTPS.

   Aby zawsze zezwalać lub nie zezwalać na wyłączny dostęp do urządzeń
   MIDI:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do Ustawień (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny > Urządzenia MIDI.
         4. Włącz (zalecane) lub wyłącz opcję Pytaj, gdy witryna chce
            korzystać z ekskluzywnych wiadomości systemowych, aby uzyskać
            dostęp do urządzeń MIDI.

Zarządzanie powiadomieniami na pulpicie

   Dzięki funkcji powiadomień na pulpicie witryny i aplikacje mogą
   wyświetlać informacje o statusach oraz aktywności usług. Powiadomienia
   są wyświetlane na pulpicie nawet wtedy, gdy okno przeglądarki jest
   zminimalizowane. Mogą informować Cię o nowych wiadomościach e-mail,
   ofertach specjalnych lub komentarzach na Twoim blogu.

   Możesz określić sposób dostarczania powiadomień przez witryny.
   Domyślnie Opera wyświetla zapytanie, czy witryna ma wyświetlać
   powiadomienia. Możesz zezwolić lub nie zezwolić witrynie na
   wyświetlanie powiadomień, a Opera zapamięta Twój wybór dla danej
   witryny.

   Aby zarządzać ustawieniami powiadomień na pulpicie:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do Ustawień (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny > Powiadomienia.
         4. Włącz (zalecane) lub wyłącz Zapytaj przed wysłaniem.

Zarządzanie wyskakującymi oknami na stronach

   Opera próbuje odróżniać okna, których otwarcia sobie życzysz (np. okna
   logowania), od wyskakujących okien otwieranych automatycznie przez
   witryny (np. reklamy).

   Domyślnie Opera blokuje okna, których sobie nie życzysz. Możesz
   określić sposób obsługi wyskakujących okien.

   Aby zmienić ustawienia wyskakujących okien:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny > Pop-upy i przekierowania
         4. Włącz lub wyłącz Zezwalaj.

   Kliknij przycisk Dodaj, aby ustawić preferencje specyficzne dla
   witryny.

Web preferences

Enable Autofill

   If you enable Autofill, Opera can complete common forms for you online
   including your address or credit card information.

   To enable Autofill:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Passwords and forms, click Autofill settings.
    4. Turn on Autofill forms.

   To add an address or credit card for Opera to use when automatically
   filling in forms, click the Add button.

   Your contact or credit card information can later be edited or removed.
   Click the  menu next to the item you wish to edit or remove.

Manage camera access on pages

   Some sites may ask to access your computer’s camera.

   By default, Opera will always ask you to allow a site to access your
   camera. Opera will remember your sharing choice if the site is secured
   through an HTTPS connection.

   To allow or block sites from accessing your camera:
    1. Go to Settings .
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Camera.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Ask before accessing (recommended).

   You can also set which camera you wish Opera to use by default, if you
   have more than one connected to your computer. Use the dropdown menu to
   set your camera preference.

Manage cookies in pages

   Cookies are small data files that store information in connection with
   a website. For example, a cookie may be created to store the contents
   of a shopping basket or to confirm that you are logged in as you browse
   the pages of a site.

   Cookies can be used to construct a profile of your browsing habits and
   are therefore regarded by some as a privacy issue.

Set your cookie preferences

   Setting preferences gives you control of how Opera handles cookies. The
   default setting is to accept all cookies.

   To set your cookie preferences:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Cookies.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Allow sites to save and read cookie data
       (recommended).

   There are two additional options for handling cookies:
     * Keep local data only until you quit your browser – Deletes cookies
       that have been added after this preference was enabled when closing
       the browser.
     * Block third-party cookies – Blocks cookies set by other websites
       whose content is displayed in frames or images on the current
       website you are visiting. Blocking third-party cookies will allow
       only the cookies for the site you are visiting to be set on your
       system.

   Click the Add button next to the Block, Clear on exit, or Allow
   sections to set site-specific cookie preferences for websites.

   Type [*.] before the domain name to create an exception for an entire
   domain name. Creating an [*.]opera.com cookie exception will apply to
   pages such as blogs.opera.com and addons.opera.com. IP addresses can
   also be added as exceptions.

Manage how links are handled

   Some sites may ask to open special types of links by default. These are
   called protocol handlers. For example, you can set Opera to
   open ical: links in Google Calendar’s web app or force mailto: links to
   open in your email web app.

   To allow or not allow sites to ask to be the default handlers of
   specific types of links:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Handlers.
    5. At the top, click Allow sites to ask to become default handlers for
       protocols (recommended) or Do not allow any site to handle
       protocols.

   Click the  menu next to a handler to remove it.

Manage images on pages

   You can control how Opera handles images on the pages you view. You can
   opt to display all images or not, as well as set site-specific image
   preferences.

   To change image settings:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Images.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Show all (recommended).

   Click the Add button to set site-specific preferences.

Manage JavaScript in pages

   JavaScript is a scripting language used to add functions to pages, such
   as manipulating browser windows. In rare cases, JavaScript may be used
   intrusively to perform certain actions you may find annoying. For these
   cases, you can turn it off completely. If you do, some pages will not
   work as designed.

   To change JavaScript settings:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click JavaScript.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Allowed (recommended).

   Click the Add button to set site-specific preferences.

Manage location sharing in pages

   Some sites may ask to use your location to provide localized features,
   such as reviews for nearby shops or coupons from businesses located in
   your area. To do this, these sites may ask you to allow geolocation on
   the page. You can choose whether or not to share your location when
   browsing. Opera will not share this information without your
   permission.

   Setting location sharing preferences gives you control over how sites
   access your location. By default, Opera asks you if you’d like to share
   your location the first time you visit a site that requests it. You can
   choose to allow or deny access to your location, and Opera will
   remember your choice for future visits to that site.

   To manage your location sharing preferences:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Location.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Ask before accessing (recommended).

   Click the  icon to remove individual site exceptions.

   Read more about geolocation and location sharing.

Manage microphone access in pages

   Some sites and web apps may ask to access your computer’s microphone.
   For example, a live-chat app may want to use your mic so you can speak
   to another person through their service.

   By default, Opera will always ask you to allow a site to access your
   microphone. Opera will remember your sharing choice if the site is
   secured through an HTTPS connection.

   To manage sites’ access to your microphone:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Microphone.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Ask before accessing (recommended).

   You can also set which microphone you wish Opera to use by default, if
   you have more than one connected to your computer. Use the dropdown
   menus to set your microphone preferences.

Manage MIDI access in pages

   If you connect a musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) device to
   your computer, such as a keyboard or controller, some sites and web
   apps may ask to have exclusive access to the device. For example, a
   developer may make a new synthesizer available on the web that you can
   use with your keyboard.

   When the site has exclusive access, other apps (both on the web and on
   your computer) may fail to receive output from your device.

   By default, Opera will always ask you to allow a site to have exclusive
   access your MIDI device. Opera will remember your sharing choice if the
   site is secured through an HTTPS connection.

   To always allow or deny sites’ exclusive access to your MIDI devices:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click MIDI devices.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Ask when a site wants to use system
       exclusive messages to access MIDI devices (recommended).

Manage desktop notifications

   Desktop notifications allow websites and apps to display information
   about their service’s activities or status. These notifications display
   on your computer’s desktop even when the browser is minimized. They can
   alert you to things like new emails, special coupon offers, or if
   comments are posted to your blog.

   You can control how sites deliver notifications. By default, Opera asks
   you if you’d like a site to notify you. You can choose to allow or deny
   the site to display notifications, and Opera will remember your choice
   for future visits to that site.

   To manage desktop notifications:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Notifications.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Ask before sending (recommended).

   Click the Add button to set site-specific preferences.

Manage saved passwords

   When you log in to a website, Opera gives you the option to save your
   password. If you click Never, that site will be added to Opera’s never
   saved list.

   By default, Opera will offer to save your passwords. To disable this
   offering:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Passwords and forms, click Manage passwords.
    4. At the top, turn off Offer to save passwords.

   [password-manager.png]

   To view details or to remove your passwords, click the menu next to a
   website.

   When entering a username and password for a website, Opera will ask if
   you wish to save the password in your password manager.

   Click Save to save the password for this website in your password
   manager.

   Click Never to decline saving your password for this website.

   Click the X to close the window. Opera will ask again the next time you
   log in to the website.

   To remove passwords individually:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, then click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Autofill, click Passwords.
    4. Click the three-dot menu next to the password you want to remove,
       then click Remove.

   To remove all passwords:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, then click Privacy & security.
    3. Click Clear browsing data.
    4. In the pop-up window, click Advanced.
    5. Select the Passwords and other sign-in data box (leave everything
       else unselected), then click Clear data.

Manage pop-ups and redirects in pages

   Opera will try to distinguish pop-ups that you have requested (login
   pages, for example) from pop-ups launched automatically from websites,
   such as advertising.

   By default, Opera will block pop-ups you have not requested. You can
   control how Opera handles pop-ups.

   To change pop-up settings:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Site settings.
    4. Click Pop-ups and redirects.
    5. At the top, turn on or off Allowed.

   Click the Add button to set site-specific preferences.

Security and privacy

Ad blocker

   In order to use Opera’s built-in ad blocker, the feature must first be
   enabled in the browser. To enable Opera’s ad blocker, or to turn off ad
   blocker:
    1. Open Opera and go to Settings.
    2. Under Block ads, click the switch. This will enable ad blocker.

   The blue ad blocker badge  on the right side of the combined address
   and search bar shows that the feature is enabled. The badge has no
   color when ad blocker is disabled.

   Click the ad blocker icon to open the ad blocker pop-up window. In this
   window you can disable ad blocker, see how many blocked ads there are
   on the currently open webpage or in your browsing history, find a link
   to the speed test, and find a link to the settings page for ad blocker.

Whitelist a website in Opera’s ad blocker

   Some websites request that you disable ad blocker so you can visit and
   fully enjoy their webpage. Instead of having to completely turn off
   Opera’s ad blocker to visit one site, you can whitelist the requesting
   website.

   To do this, open the ad blocker pop-up window in the combined address
   and search bar and click the switch. This will stop ad blocker on that
   site.

   Opera’s ad blocker pauses when you visit a whitelisted website and
   resumes when you navigate to another website, allowing for an
   uninterrupted browsing experience.

   The whitelisted website’s domain is added to your ad blocking
   exceptions list. Read below to learn how to manage exceptions for
   Opera’s ad blocker.

Managing filter lists for Opera’s ad blocker

   You can choose which filter lists Opera’s ad blocker uses when the
   feature is enabled. EasyList and NoCoin are enabled by default. To
   manage lists in Opera’s ad blocker:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Under Block ads, click Manage lists.
    3. Check the boxes next to the lists you want enabled for ad blocker.

   Opera updates your selected lists automatically. You can update the
   lists manually by clicking the Update button at the top of the page.

   These lists, also known as filter lists, contain rules that tell ad
   blockers which content is likely to be an ad. The most popular and
   commonly used list for removing ads on international websites is
   EasyList. Opera includes additional lists, such as EasyPrivacy, NoCoin,
   and lists for multiple languages, in order to remove ads.

   NoCoin is a cryptocurrency mining protection filter list which stops
   crytpojacking scripts from running on your computer. Read more about
   Opera’s cryptocurrency mining protection.

   Learn how to turn ad blocker on or off.

VPN

   Normally, your browser connects directly to websites, allowing websites
   to identify your IP address and approximate location. With VPN, you
   connect to websites via a VPN (virtual private network) server. As a
   result, your apparent location changes to the location of the server.
   To enable VPN:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Features.
    3. Under VPN, turn on Enable VPN.

   When you enable VPN, it starts automatically, and the blue VPN badge
   appears in the combined address and search bar. Click on the badge, and
   you will see an on/off switch, information about the amount of data
   transferred, the virtual location, and the virtual IP address.

   From the point of view of websites, your browser is now located in the
   region given by the virtual location. To change your virtual location,
   select a region from the list. If you do not choose a region, you are
   automatically assigned an optimal location. To turn off VPN, flip the
   switch in the badge.

   Because the connection from your browser to the VPN server is
   encrypted, even if the local network is not, VPN enhances your privacy
   on the local network. You can hide your browsing activities from other
   users of that network.

   To enhance your privacy with regard to websites, making it more
   difficult for them to track you, you need a combination of features.
   The issue is cookies. Even if you disguise your location, websites can
   still identify you if they have set a cookie. Notice, however, that
   by blocking ads you block the source of many tracking cookie. At the
   end of a private browsing session, when you close the browser, all
   cookies from that session are deleted.

   VPN is a free service, and the amount of data you are allowed to
   transfer is unlimited.

Private window

   Private browsing ensures that your internet history and activity data
   is removed as soon as you close all private windows.
     * To browse privately on Windows and Linux, go to Menu > New private
       window.
     * To browse privately on Mac, select File > New Private Window.

   When you close all private windows, Opera will clear the following
   associated data:
     * Browsing history
     * Items in cache
     * Cookies

   After being closed, a private tab or window cannot be recovered from
   the Recently Closed list in the tab menu.

   While private windows do not leave any record of the websites you
   visit, if you deliberately save data – for example, if you save an item
   to your Speed Dial, save a password, or download a file – it will still
   be visible after the window is closed.

Clear browsing data

   By default, Opera stores certain browsing data to help speed up
   connections, load common page elements, and improve your interaction
   with the sites you visit. You may wish to remove traces of your
   browsing habits by clearing your browsing data. To clear browsing data:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Clear browsing data.
    4. Select a time range and the types of data you wish to clear, and
       click Clear data.

   Browsing history – A list of sites you have visited.

   Download history – A record of the files you’ve downloaded. Clearing
   this will not delete the file you downloaded, only the record of where
   and when.

   News usage data – Information on the frequency and the length of time
   you spend on a news article from the personal news page, which is used
   to customize what news you see.

   Cookies and other site data – Data from websites you visit which is
   stored on your computer, such as site preferences and login status.

   Cached images and files – Data stored on your computer by applications
   or websites to make processes and site loading faster. Should be
   cleared periodically.

   Passwords and other sign-in data – Data related to logging into
   websites and applications. Allows you to be signed-in automatically.

   Autofill form data – Information like credit-card numbers, names and
   phone numbers, which you can choose to store on your computer in order
   to have forms filled in automatically.

   Site settings – Permission data for websites, such as whether they can
   access your microphone or send you cookies.

   Hosted app data – Data stored by extensions you have installed in your
   browser. Clearing this data will reset the extension to its default.

   Clearing your browsing history will delete any stored location
   information about the pages you have viewed and the times you accessed
   them.

   Clearing download history will empty Opera’s record of the files you’ve
   downloaded through the browser. This will not delete the file from your
   local machine, only the record of when and where you downloaded it.

   Deleting cookies and other site data will remove any tracked site
   data. Read more about managing cookies here.

   Emptying your browser’s cache will delete any temporarily stored data
   from websites. The cache is used to briefly store page elements such as
   images or search queries. Cached data also helps reduce loading times
   when you wish to access a recently visited site. Emptying cache will
   clear up space on you local disk.

   Clearing data from hosted apps will delete any data stored by
   extensions you have installed in the browser. For example, if you
   installed a weather extension on Speed Dial and set your location in
   its settings, clearing this data will reset the extension to its
   default and you will have to tell the extension your location again.
   Note: Take care not to erase useful data inadvertently. If you are not
   already familiar with it, try private browsing. The data for private
   browsing is automatically cleared when you close all private windows.

   Managing how Opera stores private data may be useful, as an alternative
   to clearing all private data. Read more about setting web preferences.

Security badges

   Opera warns you about suspicious pages by checking the page you request
   against a database of known phishing and malware websites. To protect
   yourself when entering sensitive information, always look for the  lock
   in the security badge to the left of the combined address and search
   bar.

   Badges indicate details about the page you are viewing. When a badge
   appears in your combined address and search bar, click it to see more
   information, including security certificates and more.
   Icon        Indicates…
        Compressed connection
        Ads are blocked
        Camera access
        Extension
        Fraud or malware warning
        Local file
        Location access
        Microphone access
        Opera page
        Secure connection
        Unprotected connection
        MIDI access
        VPN is on

   When the connection is secure, a lock is displayed in the security
   badge, implying that no one else can read the information that passes
   between you and the site. Opera uses certificates to verify the
   identity of the site owners. A lock means there is good encryption
   between you and the recipient, and the recipient’s identity has been
   verified.

   If a website is blacklisted, you will be presented with a warning page,
   and you can decide whether to visit the website or to go back safely to
   the previous page. Fraud and malware protection does not cause any
   delay in the opening of pages.

Unblock and allow insecure content

   If you are browsing on an encrypted connection (https://), Opera will
   check to ensure that all parts of the site are encrypted. If Opera
   detects that any live elements of the page, for example scripts,
   plugins, or frames, are being served by an open connection (http://),
   it will block the insecure content. This means parts of the page may
   not display properly.

   Opera advises against allowing insecure content to load into an
   encrypted connection. The best way to protect your sensitive
   information is to interact only with secure content. When Opera detects
   insecure content and blocks it, a warning will appear on the right side
   of the combined address and search bar.

   If you do not care about the security of your connection with the site,
   you can click the warning to show an Unblock button. This button will
   allow the blocked content to be loaded onto the page, and the security
   badge will change to show an open padlock, reminding you that you’ve
   allowed insecure content to display on an encrypted connection.

Manage security certificates

   HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a widely used technology
   that provides encrypted communication and identity assurance on the
   Internet. Security certificates are used to verify the ownership of
   Internet domains. If you see a green padlock security badge in your
   combined address and search bar, then according to your operating
   system’s configuration, you are securely connected to the website.
   However, it is still your responsibility to make sure that the address
   is correct. When in doubt, type the address by hand.

   If you’d like more information about a site’s security certificate,
   click on the security badge and click the Certificate (Valid) link.
   Opera will provide the certificate’s issuer, the type of certificate,
   and whether the issuer is publicly-known and valid.

   Publicly-known issuers and their certificates are validated against a
   number of security and identity checks. Opera will warn you if some
   part of a publicly-known issuer’s certificate is questionable. You may
   choose to proceed but Opera cannot guarantee your security.

   To see which HTTPS/TLS certificates are used by your Opera browser and
   how Opera handles them:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, click Manage certificates.

A note about local certificate issuers

   Some connections can be certified by certificates from local issuers,
   either from apps on your machine or other non-public sources (such as a
   local intranet). These issuers can be used to verify secured
   connections in the browser. Most of these connections are valid. For
   example, debugging applications, third-party security scanning, and
   parental filters may rely on locally-issued certificates.

   Connections certified by certificates from local issuers aren’t
   screened by the same security standards as publicly-known issuers and
   certificates. Such screening is too strict and may not allow
   connections to work as intended. Malware or viruses may use these
   certificates to view encrypted information or inject ads.

   If you wish, you can configure Opera to warn you about public sites
   that use certificates from local issuers. If you continue to browse on
   these connections, be aware that some security measures, such as
   certificate pinning and Certificate Transparency, will be disabled for
   all such connections during your browsing session.

   Review how to manage security certificates.

Invalid certificate warnings in Opera

   Invalid certificate pop-up in Opera

   If Opera cannot verify the identity of the server for a website you
   wish to visit, you will see this pop-up. Click Show certificate to
   review the certificate yourself. When reviewing the certificate, check
   that the certificate’s validity date is current and that the issuer of
   the certificate is trusted.

   Click Continue anyway to proceed to the website.

   If you do not trust the server or the certificate and you wish to not
   proceed to the website, click Cancel.

A note about Extended Validation (EV) certificates

   The best guarantee of a website’s identity is provided by Extended
   Validation (EV) certificates. Extended Validation means that the
   details of the organization buying the certificate have been audited by
   an accountable, third-party entity, who can therefore verify that the
   certificate owner is who it claims to be. EV websites are indicated by
   a green security badge with a padlock in the address field.

   Extended Validation certificates are designed to endorse a company’s
   validity as a reliable, rather than transient, business. For example,
   to obtain a certificate, a company must provide three years of tax
   records and other financial information to the Certificate Authority.
   This certification provides peace of mind and security for Internet
   shoppers.

   Opera has already implemented procedures and processes for EV
   certification and is at the forefront of complying with standards. We
   have built-in procedures to automatically verify that everything in a
   certificate for a website is correct when someone visits a page on the
   site and that the certificate has not been revoked.

Tell sites to not track your activity

   Most sites track your behavior while you visit them. If you do not like
   this idea, Opera can send an additional header with every request:
   “DNT: 1”. This is a flag to websites that the user does not want to be
   tracked. Some countries have DNT legislation that will legally protect
   your request and most well-behaved websites will respect this
   additional header.

   You can set Opera to tell sites you prefer to opt-out of online
   behavioral tracking. To set this:
    1. Go to Settings.
    2. Click Advanced in the left sidebar, and click Privacy & security.
    3. Under Privacy and security, turn on Send a “Do Not Track” request
       with your browsing traffic.

A note about phishing and malware

   Opera’s fraud and malware Protection warns you about suspicious web
   pages and is enabled by default. It checks the requested page against
   several databases of known phishing and malware websites, called
   blacklists. Although it is not possible to totally eliminate the risk
   of encountering an unidentified phishing or malware website, the risk
   is minimized.

   Note that checking against the database does not delay the opening of
   web pages.

Phishing

   The growth of Internet commerce has given online criminals an
   opportunity to steal your passwords, your credit card numbers, and
   other personal information by impersonating authority figures from your
   bank or other institutions you frequent. This is known as phishing.

   You will be encouraged to log in and “verify” your customer
   information: in other words, to reveal your password, credit card
   number, or other private data. The best defense against this threat is
   to be aware of the problem and to be alert when transacting business
   online.

Malware

   For the same reason that you have anti-virus software installed, you
   may want protection from websites that distribute viruses or other
   malicious software, collectively known as malware. The concept of
   malware encompasses not just viruses, but also scripts that may run
   automatically when you load a web page.

Předvolby webu

Povolení automatického vyplňování

   Povolíte-li funkci automatického vyplňování, Opera se za vás pokusí
   vyplnit běžné webové formuláře včetně údajů o vaší adrese či kreditní
   kartě.

   Chcete-li povolit automatické vyplňování:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Automatické vyplňování zaškrtněte volbu Povolit automatické
       vyplňování formulářů na webových stránkách.

   Opera může uložit údaje o více kontaktech či více kreditních kartách.
   Chcete-li do Opery přidat kontakt či kreditní kartu k použití při
   automatickém vyplňování formulářů, klepněte na tlačítko Správce
   nastavení automatického vyplňování.

   Kontakt či údaj o kreditní kartě můžete později upravit nebo smazat.
   Najeďte kurzorem na kartu a vyberte možnost Upravit nebo x. Pokud
   nějakou položku odstraníte, Opera již příslušné informace nebude
   vyplňovat do formulářů.

Správa přístupu stránek ke kameře

   Vývojáři nacházejí nové možnosti využití webových kamer pomocí
   moderních prohlížečů. Některé weby vás mohou požádat o přístup ke
   kameře vašeho počítače.

   Ve výchozím nastavení se vás Opera vždy dotáže, zda chcete webu povolit
   přístup k vaší kameře. Opera si zapamatuje vaši volbu sdílení, je-li
   web zabezpečen pomocí připojení HTTPS.

   Chcete-li webům vždy zakázat přístup k vaší kameře:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Kamera vyberte volbu Zakázat webům přístup ke kameře.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

   Máte-li k vašemu počítači připojeno více zařízení, lze rovněž nastavit,
   kterou kameru má Opera používat jako výchozí. K nastavení vaší
   předvolby pro kameru použijte rozbalovací menu.

Správa cookies na stránkách

   Cookies jsou malé datové soubory obsahující informaci spojenou s
   určitým webem. Cookie může například uchovávat informaci o obsahu
   vašeho nákupního košíku nebo osvědčovat vaše přihlášení pod zvolenou
   identitou při návštěvě stránek určitého webu.

   Cookies mohou být použity ke sledování vašich návyků při prohlížení
   webu a mohou proto představovat ohrožení soukromí.

Nastavení zacházení s cookies

   Nastavení předvoleb vám umožní ovládat, jak bude Opera s cookies
   zacházet. Ve výchozím nastavení je povoleno přijímat všechny cookies.

   Chcete-li nastavit zacházení s cookies:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Cookies vyberte volbu pro nakládání s cookies.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

Správa obsluhy odkazů

   Některé weby vás mohou ve výchozím nastavení žádat o povolení k
   otevírání zvláštních druhů odkazů. Toto nazýváme obsluha protokolů.
   Například můžete Operu nastavit, aby otevírala odkazy ical: ve webové
   aplikaci Google Calendar nebo ji přinutit, aby odkazy mailto: otevírala
   ve vaší e-mailové webové aplikaci.

   Chcete-li zabránit, aby vás weby žádaly o povolení být výchozími pro
   obsluhu zvláštních druhů odkazů:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Obsluha protokolů zvolte Zakázat webům obsluhu protokolů.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správa obsluhy nastavíte předvolby platné jen pro
   určitý web.

Správa obrázků na stránkách

   Je možné nastavit, jak bude Opera zacházet s obrázky na prohlížených
   stránkách. Můžete si vybrat, zda chcete zobrazovat veškeré obrázky nebo
   ne, případně zvolit nastavení nakládání s obrázky platné jen pro určitý
   web.

   Chcete-li nastavení obrázků změnit:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Obrázky vyberte volbu pro nakládání s obrázky.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

Správa JavaScriptu na stránkách

   JavaScript je skriptovací jazyk používaný pro obohacení stránek o
   některé funkce, například manipulaci s okny prohlížeče. Vzácně může být
   JavaScript zneužit k provedení akcí, které mohou být pro uživatele
   obtěžující. V takových případech je možné jej zcela vypnout. Pokud tak
   učiníte, některé webové stránky nemusí pracovat korektně.

   Chcete-li nastavení pro JavaScript změnit:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci JavaScript vyberte volbu pro nakládání se skripty v jazyce
       JavaScript.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

Správa sdílení zeměpisné polohy na stránkách

   Některé weby vás mohou požádat o využití údajů o vaší zeměpisné poloze
   pro poskytování lokalizovaných služeb, například recenze nedalekých
   obchodů či kupóny z podniků nacházejících se ve vaší oblasti. Aby bylo
   možné s těmito údaji pracovat, tyto weby vás mohou požádat o povolení
   zjišťovat vaši zeměpisnou polohu prostřednictvím otevřené stránky. Při
   prohlížení webu si můžete vybrat, zda chcete sdílet vaši zeměpisnou
   polohu či nikoli. Opera nebude sdílet tyto údaje bez vašeho svolení.

   Nastavení pro sdílení zeměpisné polohy vám umožňuje ovládat přístup
   webů k vašim geolokačním údajům. Ve výchozím nastavení budete poprvé,
   kdy navštívíte web požadující vaše geolokační údaje, dotázáni, zda
   chcete vaši zeměpisnou polohu sdílet. Můžete povolit či zakázat přístup
   k údajům o vaší poloze a Opera si vaši volbu zapamatuje i pro příští
   návštěvy daného webu.

   Chcete-li spravovat sdílení zeměpisné polohy:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Zeměpisná poloha vyberte volbu pro sdílení údajů o vaší
       zeměpisné poloze.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

   Více informací o zeměpisné poloze a sdílení zeměpisné polohy.

Správa přístupu stránek k mikrofónu

   Některé weby a webové aplikace vás mohou požádat o přístup k mikrofónu
   vašeho počítače. Například aplikace umožňující živý chat může chtít
   využít váš mikrofón, abyste mohli hovořit s jinými lidmi
   prostřednictvím této služby.

   Ve výchozím nastavení se vás Opera vždy dotáže, zda chcete webu povolit
   přístup k vašemu mikrofónu. Opera si zapamatuje vaši volbu sdílení,
   je-li web zabezpečen pomocí připojení HTTPS.

   Chcete-li webům vždy zakázat přístup k vašemu mikrofónu:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Mikrofón vyberte volbu Zakázat webům přístup k mikrofónu.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

   Máte-li k vašemu počítači připojeno více zařízení, lze rovněž nastavit,
   který mikrofón má Opera používat jako výchozí. K nastavení vaší
   předvolby pro mikrofón použijte rozbalovací menu.

Správa přístupu stránek k MIDI

   Pokud připojíte zařízení MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) k
   vašemu počítači, například klávesy nebo kontrolér, některé weby a
   webové aplikace po vás mohou vyžadovat výhradní přístup k tomuto
   zařízení. Například vývojář může zpřístupnit na webu nový syntetizér,
   který lze použít s vašimi klávesami.

   Má-li web výhradní přístup, jiné aplikace (webové i z vašeho lokálního
   počítače) nemusí být schopné přijímat výstupy z vašeho zařízení.

   Ve výchozím nastavení se vás aplikace Opera vždy zeptá, chcete-li webu
   udělit výhradní přístup k vašemu zařízení MIDI. Opera si zapamatuje
   vaši volbu sdílení, je-li web zabezpečen pomocí připojení HTTPS.

   Chcete-li webům vždy povolit či zakázat výhradní přístup k vašim
   zařízením MIDI:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Úplné ovládání MIDI vyberte vaši volbu, jak mají weby
       přistupovat k vašim zařízením MIDI.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Výjimky nastavíte předvolby platné jen pro určitý
   web.

Správa oznámení na ploše

   Oznámení na ploše umožňují webům a aplikacím zobrazovat údaje o stavu
   či aktivitách jejich služeb. Tato oznámení se zobrazí na ploše vašeho
   počítače i tehdy, je-li váš prohlížeč minimalizován. Oznámení vás mohou
   upozornit např. na nové zprávy, speciální akční nabídky či na komentáře
   k vašemu blogu.

   Můžete si nastavit způsob, jakým weby budou posílat svá oznámení. Při
   výchozí volbě se vás Opera zeptá, zda si přejete, aby vám weby posílaly
   oznámení. Můžete si vybrat, zda chcete povolit či zakázat danému webu
   zobrazovat oznámení a Opera si vaši volbu zapamatuje i pro příští
   návštěvy.

   Chcete-li spravovat oznámení na ploše:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Oznámení vyberte volbu pro zobrazení oznámení na ploše.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

Správce uložených hesel

   Pokud se přihlásíte k některému webu, Opera vám nabídne možnost uložení
   vašeho hesla. Zvolíte-li možnost Nikdy, bude daný web přidán na seznam
   webů, pro které nebudou přihlašovací údaje nikdy ukládány. Ukládaná
   hesla lze spravovat ve Správci hesel.

   Ve výchozím nastavení Opera nabízí uložení vašich hesel. Chcete-li tuto
   nabídku vypnout:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Hesla zrušte zaškrtnutí volby Nabízet ukládání hesel
       zadávaných na webových stránkách.

   Chcete-li zobrazit vaše hesla na počítačích Mac:
    1. Přejděte na Předvolby.
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Hesla klepněte na volbu Zobrazit hesla.

   Chcete-li zobrazit vaše hesla na počítačích s OS Windows nebo Linux:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení.
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Hesla klepněte na tlačítko Správce uložených hesel.

   Mac: Chcete-li smazat některé heslo z paměti vašeho počítače či dále
   spravovat uložená hesla, použijte vaši systémovou Klíčenku.


Správa automaticky otevíraných oken na stránkách

   Opera se pokusí rozlišovat u automaticky otevíraných oken, zda jde o
   reakci na požadavek uživatele (např. přihlašovací stránky) či okna
   otevíraná automaticky webovými stránkami, například reklamy.

   Ve výchozím nastavení Opera blokuje vámi nevyžádaná automaticky
   otevíraná okna. Můžete však nastavit, jak bude Opera s automaticky
   otevíranými okny nakládat.

   Chcete-li nastavení pro automaticky otevíraná okna změnit:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Weby na bočním panelu.
    3. V sekci Automaticky otevíraná okna vyberte volbu pro nakládání s
       automaticky otevíranými okny.

   Klepnutím na tlačítko Správce výjimek nastavíte předvolby platné jen
   pro určitý web.

Webeinstellungen

Autofill aktivieren

   Wenn Sie Autofill aktivieren, kann Opera für Sie online allgemeine
   Formulare ausfüllen, einschließlich Ihrer Adress- oder
   Kreditkarteninformationen.

   So aktivieren Sie Autofill:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Aktivieren Sie unter Autofill das Kontrollkästchen Automatisches
       Ausfüllen von Formularen auf Webseiten aktivieren.

   Sie können mehrere Kontaktkarten oder Kreditkarten auf Opera speichern.
   Um eine Kontakt- oder Kreditkarte hinzuzufügen, die Opera beim
   automatischen Ausfüllen von Formularen verwenden soll, klicken Sie auf
   die Schaltfläche Einstellungen für Autofill verwalten.

   Ihre Kontakt- oder Kreditkarteninformationen können später bearbeitet
   oder gelöscht werden. Bewegen Sie den Mauszeiger über die Karte und
   wählen Sie Bearbeiten oder x. Wenn Sie ein Eintrag entfernen, füllt
   Opera Formulare mit diesen Informationen nicht mehr automatisch aus.

Kamerazugriff auf den Seiten verwalten

   Entwickler finden neue Möglichkeiten zur Steuerung von Webcams durch
   moderne Browser. Einige Seiten bitten möglicherweise um Zugriff auf die
   Kamera Ihres Computers.

   Standardmäßig fordert Opera Sie immer auf, einer Seite den Zugriff auf
   Ihre Kamera zu erlauben. Opera wird sich an Ihre Freigabeauswahl
   erinnern, wenn die Seite über eine HTTPS-Verbindung gesichert ist.

   So verweigern Sie Seiten immer den Zugriff auf Ihre Kamera:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Kamera die Option Seiten dürfen nicht auf meine
       Kamera zugreifen.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

   Sie können auch festlegen, welche Kamera Opera standardmäßig verwenden
   soll, wenn Sie mehr als eine Kamera mit Ihrem Computer verbunden haben.
   Verwenden Sie das Dropdown-Menü, um Ihre Kameraeinstellungen
   festzulegen.

Cookies in den Seiten verwalten

   Cookies sind kleine Dateien, die Informationen in Verbindung mit einer
   Webseite speichern. Beispielsweise kann ein Cookie erstellt werden, um
   den Inhalt eines Einkaufskorbs zu speichern oder um zu bestätigen, dass
   Sie beim Surfen der Seiten einer Webseite angemeldet sind.

   Cookies können verwendet werden, um ein Profil Ihrer Surfgewohnheiten
   zu erstellen und werden daher von einigen als Datenschutzproblem
   angesehen.

Ihre Cookie-Einstellungen festlegen

   Wenn Sie Einstellungen festlegen, können Sie steuern, wie Opera mit
   Cookies umgeht. Die Standardeinstellung lautet, alle Cookies zu
   akzeptieren.

   So legen Sie Ihre Cookie-Einstellungen fest:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Cookies eine Option zum Umgang mit Cookies.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

Verwalten, wie Verknüpfungen verarbeitet werden

   Einige Seiten werden möglicherweise gebeten, bestimmte Linktypen
   standardmäßig zu öffnen. Diese werden Protokollhandler genannt. Sie
   können Opera beispielsweise so einstellen, dass ical: -Links in der
   Google Kalender-Webanwendung geöffnet werden, oder erzwingen, dass
   mailto: -Links in Ihrer E-Mail-Webanwendung geöffnet werden.

   So verhindern Sie, dass Seiten standardmäßig nach spezifischen Handlern
   bestimmter Linktypen gefragt werden:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Handler die Option Keiner Webseite zulassen,
       Protokolle zu verarbeiten.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Handler verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

Bilder auf Seiten verwalten

   Sie können steuern, wie Opera mit Bildern auf den von Ihnen angezeigten
   Seiten umgeht. Sie können festlegen, ob alle Bilder angezeigt werden
   sollen oder nicht, und Sie können auch standortspezifische
   Bildeinstellungen festlegen.

   So ändern Sie die Bildeinstellungen:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Bilder eine Option zum Umgang mit Bildern.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

JavaScript auf Seiten verwalten

   JavaScript ist eine Skriptsprache, mit der Funktionen zu Seiten
   hinzugefügt werden, z. B. zur Bearbeitung von Browserfenstern. In
   seltenen Fällen kann JavaScript aufdringlich verwendet werden, um
   bestimmte Aktionen durchzuführen, die Sie als störend empfinden
   könnten. In diesen Fällen können Sie es vollständig deaktivieren. Wenn
   Sie dies tun, funktionieren einige Seiten nicht wie vorgesehen.

   So ändern Sie die JavaScript-Einstellungen:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter JavaScript eine Option zum Umgang mit JavaScript.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

Verwalten der Standortfreigabe auf Seiten

   Einige Seiten werden Sie möglicherweise darum bitten, Ihren Standort zu
   verwenden, um lokalisierte Funktionen bereitzustellen, z. B.
   Erfahrungsberichte von Geschäften in der Nähe oder Gutscheine von
   Unternehmen in Ihrer Region. Um dies zu tun, bittet diese Seite Sie
   möglicherweise dazu, Geolokalisierung auf der Seite zuzulassen. Sie
   können wählen, ob Sie Ihren Standort beim Surfen freigeben möchten oder
   nicht. Opera wird diese Informationen nicht ohne Ihre Erlaubnis teilen.

   Wenn Sie die Einstellungen für die Standortfreigabe festlegen, können
   Sie steuern, wie Seiten auf Ihren Standort zugreifen. Opera fragt
   standardmäßig, ob Sie Ihren Standort beim ersten Besuch einer Webseite,
   die ihn anfordert, freigeben möchten. Sie können den Zugriff auf Ihren
   Standort zulassen oder verweigern und Opera merkt sich Ihre Auswahl für
   zukünftige Besuche auf dieser Seite.

   So verwalten Sie Ihre Standortfreigabeeinstellungen:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Standort eine Option für die Freigabe Ihres
       Standorts aus.

   Klicken Sie auf die Schaltfläche Ausnahmen verwalten, um die
   webseitenspezifischen Einstellungen festzulegen.

   Lesen Sie mehr über Geolokalisierung und Standortfreigabe.

Mikrofonzugriff auf den Seiten verwalten

   Einige Seiten und Webanwendungen bitten möglicherweise um Zugriff auf
   das Mikrofon Ihres Computers. Zum Beispiel könnte eine Live-Chat-App
   Ihr Mikrofon verwenden, damit Sie über Ihren Dienst mit einer anderen
   Person sprechen können.

   Standardmäßig fordert Opera Sie immer auf, einer Seite den Zugriff auf
   Ihr Mikrofon zu erlauben. Opera wird sich an Ihre Freigabeauswahl
   erinnern, wenn die Seite über eine HTTPS-Verbindung gesichert ist.

   So verweigern Sie Seiten immer den Zugriff auf Ihr Mikrofon:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Webseiten.
    3. Wählen Sie unter Mikrofon die Option Webseiten dürfen nicht auf
       mein Mikrofon zugreifen.

   Mikrofoneinstellungen festzulegen.

MIDI-Zugriff auf den Seiten verwalten

   Wenn Sie ein MIDI-Gerät (Digital Instrument Interface) eines
   Musikinstruments an Ihren Computer anschließen, z. B. eine Tastatur
   oder einen Controller, fragen einige Seiten und Webanwendungen
   möglicherweise nach exklusivem Zugriff auf das Gerät. Zum Beispiel kann
   ein Entwickler einen neuen Synthesizer im Internet verfügbar machen,
   den Sie mit Ihrer Tastatur verwenden können.

   Wenn die Webseite exklusiven Zugriff hat, erhalten andere Apps (sowohl
   im Web als auch auf Ihrem Computer) möglicherweise keine Ausgabe von
   Ihrem Gerät.

   Standardmäßig fordert Opera Sie immer auf, einer Seite den Zugriff auf
   Ihr MIDI-Gerät zu erlauben. Opera wird sich an Ihre Freigabeauswahl
   erinnern, wenn die Seite über eine HTTPS-Verbindung gesichert ist.

Pop-ups in Seiten verwalten

   Opera wird versuchen, Pop-ups, die Sie angefordert haben (z. B.
   Anmeldeseiten), von Pop-ups zu unterscheiden, die automatisch von
   Webseiten aufgerufen werden, wie z. B. Werbung.

Preferencje przeglądania

Włączanie automatycznego uzupełniania

   Jeśli włączysz automatyczne uzupełnianie, Opera będzie automatycznie
   wypełniać typowe formularze internetowe informacjami, takimi jak adres
   lub dane karty kredytowej.

   Aby włączyć automatyczne uzupełnianie:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. W sekcji Automatyczne uzupełnianie możesz wybrać, które formy
            mają być uzupełnianie automatycznie.

   Możesz zapisać w Operze wiele zestawów danych adresowych i danych kart
   kredytowych. Aby dodać dane adresowe lub dane karty kredytowej, które
   mają być wykorzystywane przez Operę do automatycznego uzupełniania
   formularzy, wybierz rodzaj danych (forma płatności lub adresy i
   ustawienia) i kliknij przycisk Dodaj.

   Dane adresowe lub informacje o karcie kredytowej możesz później
   edytować lub usunąć. Wystarczy umieścić wskaźnik myszy na karcie i
   wybrać przycisk Edytuj lub x. Jeśli usuniesz element, Opera nie będzie
   więcej automatycznie uzupełniać formularzy tymi informacjami.

Zarządzanie dostępem do kamery na stronach

   Programiści odkrywają nowe możliwości sterowania kamerami internetowymi
   za pomocą nowoczesnych przeglądarek. Niektóre witryny mogą próbować
   uzyskać dostęp do kamery Twojego komputera.

   Domyślnie Opera zawsze pyta, czy chcesz udostępnić witrynie kamerę.
   Opera będzie pamiętać Twój wybór, jeśli witryna jest zabezpieczona
   połączeniem HTTPS.

   Aby zarządzać dostępem stron do kamery:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. W sekcji Ustawienia witryny wybierz opcję Kamera i zarządzaj
            dostępem do kamery.

   Jeśli masz do komputera podłączonych wiele kamer, możesz również
   określić, która z nich ma być domyślnie używana przez Operę. Do
   ustawienia preferencji kamery użyj menu rozwijanego.

Zarządzanie ciasteczkami na stronach

   Ciasteczka są małymi plikami przechowującymi informacje związane z
   witrynami internetowymi. Ciasteczko może zostać utworzone np. w celu
   przechowywania zawartości koszyka zakupów lub informacji o zalogowaniu
   podczas przeglądania stron witryny.

   Ciasteczka mogą być wykorzystywane do określania profilu potrzeb i
   przyzwyczajeń użytkownika, dlatego też część użytkowników uważa je za
   potencjalne źródło problemów związanych z prywatnością.

Ustawianie preferencji ciasteczek

   Skonfigurowanie ustawień ciasteczek daje kontrolę nad sposobem ich
   obsługi przez Operę. Domyślnie przeglądarka akceptuje wszystkie
   ciasteczka.

   Aby określić preferencje ciasteczek:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. W obszarze Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo kliknij Ustawienia
            witryny.
         4. W sekcji Ciasteczka wybierz sposób obsługi ciasteczek.

   Istnieją dwie dodatkowe opcje obsługi plików cookie:
     * Przechowuj dane lokalne tylko do momentu zamknięcia przeglądarki –
       usuwa pliki cookie dodane po włączeniu tego ustawienia podczas
       zamykania przeglądarki.
     * Blokuj pliki cookie innych witryn – blokuje pliki cookie ustawione
       przez inne witryny internetowe, których zawartość jest wyświetlana
       w ramkach lub obrazach w bieżącej odwiedzanej witrynie.
       Zablokowanie plików cookie innych witryn umożliwi ustawienie w
       systemie tylko plików cookie odwiedzanej witryny.

   Kliknij przycisk Dodaj obok sekcji Blokuj, Wyczyść przy wyjściu lub
   Zezwalaj na sekcje, aby ustawić preferencje dotyczące plików cookie dla
   witryn.

   Wpisz [*.] Przed nazwą domeny, aby utworzyć wyjątek dla całej nazwy
   domeny. Utworzenie wyjątku cookie [*.] Opera.com będzie dotyczyć stron
   takich jak blogs.opera.com i addons.opera.com. Adresy IP można również
   dodawać jako wyjątki.

Zarządzanie obsługą linków

   Niektóre witryny mogą prosić, by za ich pomocą były domyślnie otwierane
   określone typy linków. Są to witryny do obsługi protokołów. Możesz na
   przykład skonfigurować Operę, aby otwierała linki ical: w aplikacji
   internetowej Kalendarz Google, lub wymusić otwieranie linków mailto: w
   wybranej internetowej aplikacji pocztowej.

   Aby witryny nie prosiły o ustawienie ich jako domyślnych witryn do
   obsługi określonych linków:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. W sekcji Ustawienia witryny wybierz Obsługa protokołów.

Zarządzanie obrazami na stronach

   Możesz określić sposób obsługi obrazów na stronach, które przeglądasz.
   Możesz zdecydować, aby wyświetlać wszystkie obrazy, nie wyświetlać
   żadnych lub obsługiwać je zgodnie z ustawieniami dla określonych
   witryn.

   Aby zmienić ustawienia obrazów:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. W obszarze Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo kliknij Ustawienia
            witryny.
         3. W sekcji Obrazy wybierz sposób obsługi obrazów.
         4. Na górze włącz lub wyłącz Pokaż wszystko (zalecane).

   Kliknij przycisk Dodaj, aby ustawić preferencje specyficzne dla
   witryny.

Zarządzanie skryptami JavaScript na stronach

   JavaScript jest językiem skryptowym umożliwiającym dodawanie do stron
   nowych funkcji, takich jak modyfikowanie okien przeglądarki. W rzadkich
   przypadkach działania wykonywane w oparciu o skrypty JavaScript mogą
   być natrętne i dokuczliwe. W takich przypadkach możesz całkowicie
   wyłączyć ich obsługę. Jeśli tak zrobisz, niektóre strony nie będą
   działać zgodnie z oczekiwaniami.

   Aby zmienić ustawienia JavaScript:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatności i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny.
         4. W sekcji JavaScript wybierz sposób obsługi skryptów
            JavaScript.

   Kliknij przycisk Dodaj, aby ustawić preferencje specyficzne dla
   witryny.

Zarządzanie udostępnianiem lokalizacji na stronach

   Niektóre witryny mogą próbować użyć informacji o Twojej lokalizacji w
   celu dostarczenia zlokalizowanych treści, takich jak recenzje z
   pobliskich sklepów lub kupony od firm znajdujących się w Twojej
   okolicy. Aby to zrobić, witryna może poprosić Cię o zezwolenie na
   użycie funkcji geolokalizacji. Możesz zdecydować, czy chcesz
   udostępniać swoją lokalizację podczas przeglądania. Opera nie ujawni
   tych informacji bez Twojej zgody.

   Skonfigurowanie odpowiednich preferencji umożliwi kontrolę nad
   udostępnianiem lokalizacji witrynom. Domyślnie Opera pyta, czy chcesz
   udostępnić swoją lokalizację, przy pierwszej wizycie w witrynie, która
   próbuje ją określić. Możesz zezwolić lub odmówić dostępu do informacji
   o swojej lokalizacji, a Opera zapamięta Twój wybór podczas przyszłych
   odwiedzin danej witryny.

   Aby zarządzać preferencjami udostępniania lokalizacji:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do Ustawień (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny > Lokalizacja.
         4. Włącz (zalecane) lub wyłącz Zapytaj przed dostępem.

Zarządzanie dostępem do mikrofonu na stronach

   Niektóre witryny i aplikacje internetowe mogą próbować uzyskać dostęp
   do mikrofonu Twojego komputera. Na przykład aplikacja typu live-chat
   może potrzebować Twojego mikrofonu, by pozwolić Ci rozmawiać z inną
   osobą za jej pośrednictwem.

   Domyślnie Opera zawsze pyta, czy chcesz udostępnić witrynie mikrofon.
   Opera będzie pamiętać Twój wybór, jeśli witryna jest zabezpieczona
   połączeniem HTTPS.

   Aby zarządzać dostępem witryny do mikrofonu:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do Ustawień (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny > Mikrofon.
         4. Włącz (zalecane) lub wyłącz Pytaj przed uzyskaniem dostępu.

   Jeśli masz do komputera podłączonych wiele mikrofonów, możesz również
   określić, który z nich ma być domyślnie używany przez Operę. Do
   ustawienia preferencji mikrofonu użyj menu rozwijanego.

Zarządzanie dostępem do urządzeń MIDI na stronach

   Jeśli podłączysz do komputera urządzenie z interfejsem MIDI, takie jak
   klawiatura lub kontroler, niektóre witryny i aplikacje internetowe mogą
   prosić o uzyskanie wyłącznego dostępu do takiego urządzenia.
   Programista może na przykład udostępnić w Internecie nowy syntezator, z
   którego możesz korzystać za pomocą swojej klawiatury.

   Gdy witryna uzyska wyłączny dostęp, inne aplikacje (zarówno
   internetowe, jak i te zainstalowane na Twoim komputerze) nie będą mogły
   odczytywać sygnałów z urządzenia.

   Domyślnie Opera zawsze pyta, czy chcesz przyznać witrynie wyłączny
   dostęp do urządzenia MIDI. Opera będzie pamiętać Twój wybór, jeśli
   witryna jest zabezpieczona połączeniem HTTPS.

   Aby zawsze zezwalać lub nie zezwalać na wyłączny dostęp do urządzeń
   MIDI:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do Ustawień (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny > Urządzenia MIDI.
         4. Włącz (zalecane) lub wyłącz opcję Pytaj, gdy witryna chce
            korzystać z ekskluzywnych wiadomości systemowych, aby uzyskać
            dostęp do urządzeń MIDI.

Zarządzanie powiadomieniami na pulpicie

   Dzięki funkcji powiadomień na pulpicie witryny i aplikacje mogą
   wyświetlać informacje o statusach oraz aktywności usług. Powiadomienia
   są wyświetlane na pulpicie nawet wtedy, gdy okno przeglądarki jest
   zminimalizowane. Mogą informować Cię o nowych wiadomościach e-mail,
   ofertach specjalnych lub komentarzach na Twoim blogu.

   Możesz określić sposób dostarczania powiadomień przez witryny.
   Domyślnie Opera wyświetla zapytanie, czy witryna ma wyświetlać
   powiadomienia. Możesz zezwolić lub nie zezwolić witrynie na
   wyświetlanie powiadomień, a Opera zapamięta Twój wybór dla danej
   witryny.

   Aby zarządzać ustawieniami powiadomień na pulpicie:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do Ustawień (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny > Powiadomienia.
         4. Włącz (zalecane) lub wyłącz Zapytaj przed wysłaniem.

Zarządzanie wyskakującymi oknami na stronach

   Opera próbuje odróżniać okna, których otwarcia sobie życzysz (np. okna
   logowania), od wyskakujących okien otwieranych automatycznie przez
   witryny (np. reklamy).

   Domyślnie Opera blokuje okna, których sobie nie życzysz. Możesz
   określić sposób obsługi wyskakujących okien.

   Aby zmienić ustawienia wyskakujących okien:
    1.
         1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
         2. Kliknij Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
         3. Wybierz Ustawienia witryny > Pop-upy i przekierowania
         4. Włącz lub wyłącz Zezwalaj.

   Kliknij przycisk Dodaj, aby ustawić preferencje specyficzne dla
   witryny.

Веб-предпочтения

Включение автозаполнения

   При включенном автозаполнении Opera будет подставлять в однотипные
   формы онлайн ваши данные, например адрес или номер кредитной карты.

   Чтобы включить автозаполнение, выполните следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Privacy & security (Конфиденциальность и безопасность) на
       боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Autofill (Автозаполнение) установите флажок Enable
       auto-filling of forms on webpages (Включить автозаполнение форм на
       страницах).

   В Opera можно сохранить несколько вариантов контактных данных и данных
   кредитных карт. Чтобы добавить в Opera контактные данные или данные
   кредитной карты для автоматической подстановки в формы, нажмите кнопку
   Manage autofill settings (Управление настройками автозаполнения).

   Добавленные контактные данные и данные кредитной карты можно
   редактировать или удалять. Наведите курсор на карту и нажмите Edit
   (Изменить) или x. При удалении элемента Opera прекращает использовать
   соответствующие данные для автозаполнения.

Управление доступом веб-страниц к камерам

   Разработчики сайтов находят все новые и новые способы управлять
   веб-камерами через браузер пользователя. Некоторые сайты могут
   запрашивать доступ к камере вашего компьютера.

   По умолчанию Opera всегда спрашивает, разрешаете ли вы данному сайту
   доступ к вашей камере. Opera будет использовать ваш выбор и при
   последующих посещениях этого сайта, если его безопасность обеспечена
   HTTPS-соединением.

   Чтобы полностью запретить сайтам доступ к вашей камере, выполните
   следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Websites (Сайты) на боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Camera (Камера) выберите Do not allow sites to access my
       camera (Запретить сайтам доступ к камере).

   Нажмите кнопку Manage Exceptions (Управление исключениями), чтобы
   задать настройки для определенных сайтов.

   Если к вашему компьютеру подключено несколько камер, в настройках можно
   выбрать, какие из них Opera будет использовать по умолчанию. Это можно
   сделать в выпадающем меню.

Управление файлами cookie на страницах

   Cookie – это небольшие файлы, в которых хранится информация о сайтах.
   Например, файл cookie создается для хранения содержимого вашей корзины
   в интернет-магазине или для подтверждения входа в систему при переходе
   с одной страницы сайта на другую.

   Файлы cookie могут использоваться для создания профиля
   интернет-предпочтений пользователя, и некоторые рассматривают их как
   своего рода вторжение в частную жизнь.

Настройка параметров файлов cookie

   Настройка параметров файлов cookie в браузере Opera позволяет
   контролировать порядок их использования. По умолчанию все файлы cookie
   принимаются.

Управление обработкой ссылок

   Некоторые сайты могут запрашивать разрешение на то, чтобы ссылки
   определенных типов по умолчанию открывались с их помощью. Такие сайты
   называются обработчиками протоколов. Например, ссылки, начинающиеся
   с ical:, могут открываться в веб-приложении «Google Календарь», а
   ссылки, начинающиеся с mailto: – в веб-приложении для работы с
   электронной почтой.

   Чтобы запретить сайтам запрашивать разрешение на обработку ссылок
   определенных типов по умолчанию, выполните следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Privacy & security (Конфиденциальность и безопасность) на
       боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Handlers (Обработчики) установите флажок Do not allow any
       site to handle protocols (Не разрешать никаким сайтам обрабатывать
       протоколы).

   Нажмите кнопку Manage Handlers (Управление обработчиками), чтобы задать
   настройки для определенных сайтов.

Управление изображениями на страницах

   Управление изображениями на страницах в Opera можно настроить. Можно
   показывать все изображения или полностью отключить их, а также задать
   параметры изображений для тех или иных сайтов.

   Для изменения параметров изображений выполните следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Websites (Сайты) на боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Images (Изображения) выберите, как поступать с
       изображениями.

Управление JavaScript на страницах

   JavaScript – это язык написания сценариев, который используется для
   создания новых функций страниц, например, для управления окнами
   браузера. В редких случаях JavaScript может использоваться без ведома
   пользователя для выполнения определенных действий, которые некоторых
   могут раздражать. В таких случаях JavaScript можно полностью отключить.
   Помните, однако, что тогда некоторые страницы будут функционировать не
   совсем корректно.

   Для изменения параметров JavaScript выполните следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Websites (Сайты) на боковой панели.
    3. В разделе JavaScript выберите, как поступать с JavaScript.

   Нажмите кнопку Manage Exceptions (Управление исключениями), чтобы
   задать настройки для определенных сайтов.

Управление данными о местонахождении

   Некоторые сайты могут запрашивать данные о вашем местонахождении, чтобы
   предоставить вам максимально актуальную информацию, например, отзывы о
   магазинах или спецпредложения компаний, расположенных в вашем районе.
   Такие сайты могут запрашивать у вас разрешение на использование данных
   геолокации. Вы можете разрешить или запретить использование данных о
   вашем местонахождении. Opera не будет передавать такую информацию без
   вашего разрешения.

   Вы можете контролировать использование данных о вашем местонахождении
   при помощи настроек передачи данных о местонахождении. По умолчанию
   Opera спрашивает, хотите ли вы сообщать о своем местонахождении, при
   первом посещении сайта, который запросил такую информацию. Вы можете
   разрешить или запретить доступ к данным о вашем местонахождении, и
   Opera запомнит ваш выбор для последующих посещений этого сайта.

   Чтобы настроить передачу данных о вашем местонахождении, выполните
   следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Websites (Сайты) на боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Location (Местонахождение) выберите, как поступать с
       данными о вашем местонахождении.

   Нажмите кнопку Manage Exceptions (Управление исключениями), чтобы
   задать настройки для определенных сайтов.

   Подробнее о геолокации и данных о местонахождении можно прочитать
   здесь.

Управление доступом веб-страниц к микрофону

   Некоторые сайты могут запрашивать доступ к микрофону вашего компьютера.
   Например, доступ к микрофону может понадобиться чат-приложению, чтобы
   вы могли не только переписываться, но и говорить со своим собеседником.

   По умолчанию Opera всегда спрашивает, разрешаете ли вы данному сайту
   доступ к вашему микрофону. Opera будет использовать ваш выбор и при
   последующих посещениях этого сайта, если его безопасность обеспечена
   HTTPS-соединением.

   Чтобы полностью запретить доступ к вашему микрофону, выполните
   следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Websites (Сайты) на боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Microphone (Микрофон) выберите Do not allow sites to
       access my microphone (Запретить сайтам доступ к микрофону).

   Нажмите кнопку Manage Exceptions (Управление исключениями), чтобы
   задать настройки для определенных сайтов.

   Если к вашему компьютеру подключено несколько микрофонов, в настройках
   можно выбрать, какие из них Opera будет использовать по умолчанию. Это
   можно сделать в выпадающих меню.

Управление доступом веб-страниц к устройствам MIDI

   Если к вашему компьютеру подключено устройство цифрового интерфейса
   музыкального инструмента (MIDI), например клавиатура или контроллер,
   некоторые сайты и веб-приложения могут запрашивать монопольный доступ к
   этому устройству. Например, разработчик может разместить в интернете
   новый синтезатор для использования в сочетании с клавиатурой.

   Когда сайту предоставлен монопольный доступ к устройству, другие
   приложения (и в интернете, и на вашем компьютере) могут не получать
   выходные данные с этого устройства.

   По умолчанию Opera всегда спрашивает, разрешаете ли вы данному сайту
   монопольный доступ к вашему устройству MIDI. Opera будет использовать
   ваш выбор и при последующих посещениях этого сайта, если его
   безопасность обеспечена HTTPS-соединением.

   Чтобы разрешить или запретить монопольный доступ к вашим устройствам
   MIDI во всех случаях, выполните следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Websites (Сайты) на боковой панели.
    3. В разделе MIDI full control (Полное управление MIDI) выберите,
       предоставлять ли сайтам доступ к вашему устройству MIDI.

   Нажмите кнопку Exceptions (Управление исключениями), чтобы установить
   настройки для конкретных сайтов.

Управление уведомлениями на рабочем столе

   Уведомления на рабочем столе позволяют сайтам и приложениям отображать
   информацию об активности или статусе служб. Такие уведомления
   появляются на рабочем столе компьютера, даже если окно браузера
   свернуто. Они могут сообщать вам, к примеру, о наличии новых сообщений
   электронной почты, о специальных скидках, о комментариях, размещенных у
   вас в блоге.

   Вы можете сами настраивать параметры отображения уведомлений для
   различных сайтов. По умолчанию Opera спрашивает, хотите ли вы, чтобы
   сайт присылал уведомления. Вы можете разрешить или запретить
   отображение уведомлений – Opera будет использовать ваш выбор и при
   последующих посещениях этого сайта.

   Для настройки уведомлений на рабочем столе выполните следующие
   действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Websites (Сайты) на боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Notifications (Уведомления) выберите, как поступать с
       уведомлениями на рабочем столе.

   Нажмите кнопку Manage Exceptions (Управление исключениями), чтобы
   задать настройки для определенных сайтов.

Управление сохраненными паролями

   При входе на тот или иной веб-сайт Opera предлагает сохранить пароль
   для данного сайта. Если нажать Never (Никогда), этот сайт будет
   добавлен в список Opera «Не сохранять для». Сохраненными паролями можно
   управлять в менеджере паролей.

   По умолчанию браузер Opera предлагает сохранять пароли. Для отключения
   этой настройки выполните следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Privacy & security (Конфиденциальность и безопасность) на
       боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Passwords (Пароли) снимите флажок Offer to save passwords
       I enter on the web (Предлагать сохранение вводимых паролей).

   Для просмотра паролей на Mac выполните следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в меню Preferences (Настройки).
    2. Нажмите Privacy & security (Конфиденциальность и безопасность) на
       боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Passwords (Пароли) нажмите кнопку Show passwords
       (Показать пароли).

   Для просмотра паролей на Windows или Linux выполните следующие
   действия:
    1. Перейдите в меню Settings (Настройки).
    2. Нажмите Privacy & security (Конфиденциальность и безопасность) на
       боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Passwords (Пароли) нажмите кнопку Manage saved passwords
       (Управление сохраненными паролями).

   Для удаления пароля из памяти компьютера или для дальнейшего управления
   сохраненными паролями пользователям Mac следует использовать системную
   функцию Keychain (Связка ключей).


Управление всплывающими окнами на страницах

   Браузер Opera может отличить запрошенные вами всплывающие окна (как
   правило, это страницы регистрации) от всплывающих окон, которые
   запускаются на сайтах автоматически, такие как реклама.

   По умолчанию Opera блокирует всплывающие окна, которые специально не
   запрашивались. Вы можете настроить, как Opera будет поступать со
   всплывающими окнами.

   Чтобы изменить настройки всплывающих окон, выполните следующие
   действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Websites (Сайты) на боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Pop-ups (Всплывающие окна) выберите, как поступать со
       всплывающими окнами.

   Нажмите кнопку Manage Exceptions (Управление исключениями), чтобы
   задать настройки для определенных сайтов.

Zabezpečení a soukromí


Blokování reklam

   Blokujete-li reklamy nástrojem pro blokování reklam vestavěným do
   prohlížeče Opera, blokujete též zdroje mnoha sledovacích cookies a
   skriptů pro těžení kryptoměn.


   Je-li blokování povoleno, v kombinovaném vyhledávacím a adresním řádku
   se objeví odpovídající štítek. Klepnutím na štítek se zpřístupní další
   informace, například počet zablokovaných reklam, rychlostní test
   a přepínač k odblokování reklam pro daný web.

   Chcete-li, aby na vašem počítači nedocházelo k nedovolené těžbě
   kryptoměn (tzv. cryptojacking), zaškrtněte políčko NoCoin (ochrana
   proti těžbě kryptoměn). Další informace o těžbě kryptoměn a o tom, jak
   této praxi bráníme, najdete zde.

   Informace o postupu zapnutí či vypnutí blokování reklam naleznete zde.

VPN

   Normálně se váš prohlížeč připojuje přímo k navštěvovaným webům, čímž
   jim umožňuje odhalit vaši adresu IP a tím i vaše přibližné umístění. S
   povoleným VPN se budete připojovat k navštěvovaným webům
   prostřednictvím VPN serveru. Výsledkem bude, že se vaše viditelné
   umístění změní na umístění serveru.

   Chcete-li povolit VPN:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci VPN, zaškrtněte volbu Povolit VPN.

   Povolíte-li VPN, spustí se automaticky a v kombinovaném vyhledávacím
   a adresním řádku se objeví modrý štítek VPN. Po klepnutí na štítek
   uvidíte přepínač zapnuto/vypnuto, údaj o množství přenesených dat,
   virtuální umístění a virtuální adresu IP.

   Z pohledu navštívených webů bude váš prohlížeč umístěn v regionu daném
   virtuálním umístěním. Chcete-li změnit své virtuální umístění, vyberte
   si region ze seznamu. Pokud si žádný region nevyberete, bude vám
   automaticky přidělena “optimální zeměpisná poloha”. Chcete-li VPN
   vypnout, použijte přepínač.

   Protože je připojení z vašeho prohlížeče k serveru VPN šifrováno, a to
   i pokud vaše lokální síť není, VPN chrání vaše soukromí v lokální síti.
   Můžete tak skrýt vaše aktivity při surfování před ostatními uživateli
   téže sítě.

   Chcete-li ochránit vaše soukromí před navštěvovanými weby, znesnadnit
   jim vaše sledování, potřebujete kombinaci funkcí. Problém jsou cookies.
   Ačkoli jste virtuálně změnili vaše umístění, weby vás přesto mohou
   identifikovat, použily-li cookie. Nicméně uvádíme, že funkcí blokování
   reklam lze zablokovat zdroje mnoha sledovacích cookies a také, že při
   ukončení relace soukromého prohlížení, jakmile zavřete prohlížeč, jsou
   všechny cookies dané relace smazány.

   VPN je bezplatná služba a množství dat, které můžete přenést, není
   omezeno.

Soukromé okno

   Soukromé prohlížení zajistí, aby vaše internetová historie i aktivity
   byly smazány v okamžiku, kdy uzavřete všechna soukromá okna prohlížeče.

   Chcete-li použít funkci soukromého prohlížení na počítači Mac, zvolte
   Soubor > Nové soukromé okno.

   Chcete-li používat soukromé prohlížení na počítači s OS Windows nebo
   Linux, vyberte O Menu > Nové soukromé okno.

   Jakmile zavřete všechna soukromá okna, budou Operou vymazána tato k nim
   se vztahující data:
     * Historie prohlížení
     * Položky v cache
     * Cookies

   Zavřený soukromý list či okno nelze obnovit volbou ze seznamu Dříve
   zavřené v menu listů.

   Soukromá okna nezanechávají žádné stopy po navštívených stránkách.
   Pokud však úmyslně uložíte nějakou položku např. do vašeho Rychlého
   přístupu, uložíte si heslo nebo stáhnete soubor, budou tyto viditelné
   i po zavření okna.

Výmaz soukromých údajů

   Ve výchozím nastavení Opera ukládá určitá data pro zvýšení rychlosti
   prohlížení, načítání společných prvků stránek a obecně pro lepší
   interakci s navštěvovanými weby. Je možné, že budete chtít odstranit
   stopy po vašem brouzdání po internetu výmazem soukromých údajů.

   Výmaz soukromých údajů pro uživatele počítačů Mac:
    1. Z hlavního menu vyberte Opera > Vymazat údaje o prohlížení….
    2. Časové období, od kdy mají být položky historie vymazány, zvolte
       pomocí z rozbalovacího menu, které najdete u volby Vymazat
       následující položky:
    3. Zaškrtnutím označte položky, které chcete odstranit.
    4. Klepněte na Vymazat údaje o prohlížení.

   Výmaz soukromých údajů pro uživatele počítačů s OS Windows a Linux:
    1. Přejděte na O Menu > Historie > Vymazat údaje o prohlížení.
    2. Časové období, od kdy mají být položky historie vymazány, zvolte
       pomocí z rozbalovacího menu, které najdete u volby Vymazat
       následující položky.
    3. Zaškrtnutím označte položky, které chcete odstranit.
    4. Klepněte na Vymazat údaje o prohlížení.

   Výmaz historie prohlížení smaže jakékoli uložené údaje o vámi
   zobrazených stránkách i čase jejich návštěv.

   Výmaz historie stahování vyčistí záznamy Opery o souborech, které jste
   přes prohlížeč stahovali. Nedojde přitom k odstranění staženého souboru
   z vašeho lokálního počítače, pouze se vymaže záznam o tom, kdy a odkud
   byl soubor stažen.

   Smazáním cookies a jiných dat webů budou odstraněna jakákoli data,
   kterými weby zjišťují a sledují vaše aktivity. Další informace o správě
   cookies najdete zde.

   Výmazem cache vašeho prohlížeče dojde ke smazání všech dočasně lokálně
   uložených dat navštívených webů. Cache se používá ke krátkodobému
   ukládání různých prvků stránek, například obrázků nebo vyhledávacích
   dotazů. Data v cache také pomáhají zkracovat dobu načítání, pokud znovu
   navštívíte nedávno navštívený web. Vymazáním obsahu cache uvolníte
   prostor na lokálním disku.

   Vymazáním dat hostovaných aplikací budou vymazána všechna data uložená
   rozšířeními, která jste do prohlížeče instalovali. Pokud jste si
   například nainstalovali rozšíření pro předpověď počasí do Rychlého
   přístupu a nastavili místo, k němuž se má předpověď vztahovat, výmazem
   vrátíte nastavení rozšíření na původní hodnotu a budete muset místo pro
   předpověď nastavit znovu.
   Poznámka: Buďte opatrní, abyste omylem nesmazali užitečná data. Pokud
   si nejste jisti, vyzkoušejte režim soukromého prohlížení. Data o
   stránkách prohlížených v soukromém režimu jsou automaticky vymazána při
   uzavření všech soukromých oken.

   Uživatelem prováděná správa Operou ukládaných soukromých dat může být
   užitečnou alternativou k výmazu všech soukromých dat. Více informací o
   nastavení předvoleb pro web.

Bezpečnostní štítky

   Opera vás upozorní na podezřelé stránky, když vámi požadované stránky
   hledá v databázi webů nahlášených pro podvodné praktiky „phishing“
   a šíření škodlivého kódu „malware“. Chcete-li se při zadávání citlivých
   informací chránit, vždy hledejte nalevo od kombinovaného vyhledávacího
   a adresního řádku symbol zámku.

   Štítek ukazuje podrobné informace o prohlížené stránce. Klepnutím na
   štítek zobrazený v kombinovaném vyhledávacím a adresním řádku získáte
   další informace včetně bezpečnostních certifikátů aj.

                 Ikona                              Indikuje…

   Je-li připojení zabezpečené, je na štítku zobrazen zámek, který
   znázorňuje, že nikdo jiný nemůže číst informace, které si s daným webem
   vyměníte. Opera používá certifikáty, které ověřují identitu vlastníka
   webu. Zámek znázorňuje, že mezi vámi a příjemcem je dobré šifrování
   a skutečnost, že příjemcova identita byla ověřena.

   Je-li web na černé listině, bude zobrazena varovná stránka a vy se
   budete moci rozhodnout, zda chcete web navštívit nebo bezpečně přejít
   zpět na předchozí stránku. Ochrana proti podvodným stránkám a
   škodlivému kódu nezpomaluje otevírání stránek.

Odblokování a povolení nezabezpečeného obsahu

   Používáte-li zabezpečené připojení (https://), Opera ověřuje, jsou-li
   všechny části webu zabezpečené. Zjistí-li Opera, že některý z živých
   prvků stránky, například skripty, zásuvné moduly či rámce, jsou
   poskytovány otevřeným připojením (http://), zablokuje nezabezpečený
   obsah. To v důsledku znamená, že některé části stránky nemusí být
   správně zobrazeny.

   Opera nedoporučuje, abyste při zabezpečeném připojení povolili načítání
   nezabezpečeného obsahu. Nejlepším způsobem, jak ochránit citlivé
   informace, je používat pouze zcela zabezpečené stránky. Jakmile Opera
   zjistí nezabezpečený obsah a zablokuje jej, objeví se v pravé části
   kombinovaného vyhledávacího a adresního řádku varování.

   Jestliže vám nezáleží na zabezpečení vašeho připojení k danému webu,
   můžete klepnutím na upozornění zobrazit tlačítko Odblokovat. Tímto
   tlačítkem budete moci povolit načítání blokovaného obsahu stránky.
   Přitom se štítek indikující zabezpečení změní na odemčený zámek,
   připomínající, že jste při zabezpečeném připojení povolili zobrazení
   nezabezpečeného obsahu.

Správa bezpečnostních certifikátů

   Bezpečnostní certifikáty jsou používány k ověření, že daný web je
   bezpečné používat. Většina časových certifikátů je plně platná.
   Uvidíte-li ve vašem kombinovaném vyhledávacím a adresním řádku zelený
   bezpečnostní indikátor s visacím zámkem, můžete bezpečně pokračovat v
   brouzdání.

   Pokud si přejete zjistit další údaje o certifikátu daného webu,
   klepněte na bezpečnostní indikátor a zvolte Podrobnosti. Opera nabídne
   souhrn obsahující vystavitele certifikátu, typ certifikátu a informaci,
   je-li vystavitel veřejně známý a platný.

   Veřejně známí vystavitelé a jejich certifikáty jsou ověřovány množstvím
   bezpečnostních a identifikačních zkoušek. Opera vás upozorní, pokud se
   některé části certifikátu od veřejně známého vystavitele nezdají být v
   pořádku. Můžete si zvolit, že chcete pokračovat, avšak v takovém
   případě Opera nedokáže zaručit vaši bezpečnost.

   Chcete-li zobrazit správce bezpečnostních certifikátů a zjistit, jak s
   nimi Opera nakládá:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci HTTPS/SSL klepněte na tlačítko Správce certifikátů.

Poznámka k vystavitelům místních certifikátů

   Některá připojení mohou být certifikována certifikáty místních
   vystavitelů, buď přes aplikace na vašem přístroji nebo jiné neveřejné
   zdroje (například místní intranet). Tyto vystavitele lze použít k
   ověření zabezpečeného připojení v prohlížeči. Většina těchto připojení
   je platná. Na místní certifikáty se mohou spoléhat například aplikace
   pro ladění, bezpečnostní skenování od třetích stran a rodičovské
   filtry.

   Na připojení certifikovaná místními vystaviteli nejsou kladeny stejné
   nároky ohledně plnění bezpečnostních standardů jako na certifikáty
   veřejně známých vystavitelů. Tyto nároky mohou být příliš přísné a
   nemusely by umožnit připojením pracovat tak, jak bylo zamýšleno.
   Škodlivý software (malware) nebo viry mohou využívat tyto certifikáty k
   zobrazení šifrovaných informací nebo ke vložení reklam.

   Chcete-li, můžete v nastavení Opery zvolit, aby vás Opera upozornila na
   veřejné weby používající certifikáty od místních vystavitelů.
   Využíváte-li taková připojení, mějte na paměti, že některá bezpečnostní
   opatření, například Certificate pinning a Certificate Transparency,
   budou nedostupná pro všechna taková připojení během dané relace
   prohlížeče.

   Chcete-li si prostudovat postupy správy bezpečnostních certifikátů,

Postup sdělení webům, že si nepřejete být sledováni

   Většina webů sleduje vaše chování během vaší návštěvy. Pokud se vám
   tato myšlenka nelíbí, Opera může webu posílat s každým požadavkem další
   hlavičku: „DNT: 1“. To je příznak pro weby, že si uživatel nepřeje být
   sledován. V některých zemích platí právní předpisy ohledně DNT, které
   právně chrání váš požadavek a většina korektně se chovajících webů tuto
   další hlavičku respektuje.

   Operu lze nastavit tak, aby informovala navštěvované weby, že si
   nepřejete být sledován. Nastavení provedete takto:
    1. Přejděte na Nastavení (Předvolby na počítačích Mac).
    2. Klepněte na Soukromí & bezpečnost na postranním panelu.
    3. V sekci Soukromí zaškrtněte volbu Odesílat při prohlížení webových
       stránek požadavek ‘Nesledovat’ uživatele.

Sicherheit und Privatsphäre


Werbeblocker

   Durch das Blockieren von Werbeanzeigen mit dem integrierten
   Werbeblocker von Opera blockieren Sie auch die Quelle vieler
   Tracking-Cookies sowie Kryptowährungs-Mining-Skripte.


   Wenn die Werbeanzeigenblockierung aktiviert ist, wird in der
   kombinierten Such- und Adressleiste ein Button angezeigt. Klicken Sie
   auf den Button, um weitere Informationen zu erhalten, einschließlich
   der Anzahl gesperrter Werbeanzeigen, eines Geschwindigkeitstests und
   eines ortspezifischen Schalters zur Entsperrung von Werbeanzeigen.

   Klicken Sie auf das Feld NoCoin (Kryptowährungs-Mining-Schutz), um zu
   verhindern, dass Kryptowährungs-Mining oder CryptoJacking auf Ihrem
   Computer ausgeführt wird. Lesen Sie mehr über Kryptowährungs-Mining und
   wie wir diese Praxis stoppen hier.

   Klicken Sie hier, um zu erfahren, wie Sie den Werbeblocker ein- oder
   ausschalten können.

VPN

   Normalerweise verbindet sich Ihr Browser direkt mit Webseiten, sodass
   Webseiten Ihre IP-Adresse und Ihren ungefähren Standort identifizieren
   können. Mit VPN verbinden Sie sich über einen VPN-Server mit Webseiten.
   Als Ergebnis ändert sich Ihr scheinbarer Standort auf den Standort des
   Servers.

   So aktivieren Sie VPN:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Aktivieren Sie unter VPN das Kontrollkästchen VPN aktivieren.

   Wenn Sie VPN aktivieren, wird es automatisch gestartet und der blaue
   VPN-Button wird in der kombinierten Such- und Adressleiste angezeigt.
   Klicken Sie auf den Button und Sie sehen einen
   Aktivierungs-/Deaktivierungsschalter, Informationen über die Menge der
   übertragenen Daten, den virtuellen Standort und die virtuelle
   IP-Adresse.

   Aus der Sicht von Webseiten befindet sich Ihr Browser nun in der
   Region, die der virtuelle Standort angibt. Um Ihren virtuellen Standort
   zu ändern, wählen Sie eine Region aus der Liste aus. Wenn Sie keine
   Region auswählen, wird Ihnen automatisch ein „optimaler Standort“
   zugewiesen. Um VPN zu deaktivieren, klappen Sie den Schalter um.

   Da die Verbindung von Ihrem Browser zum VPN-Server verschlüsselt ist,
   verbessert VPN auch im lokalen Netzwerk Ihre Privatsphäre, selbst wenn
   dieses Netzwerk nicht verschlüsselt ist. Sie können Ihre
   Browseraktivitäten vor anderen Benutzern dieses Netzwerks verbergen.

   Um Ihre Privatsphäre in Bezug auf Webseiten zu verbessern und es für
   diese Webseiten schwieriger zu machen, Sie zu verfolgen, benötigen Sie
   eine Kombination von Funktionen. Das Problem sind Cookies. Selbst wenn
   Sie Ihren Standort verschleiern, können Webseiten Sie immer noch
   identifizieren, wenn sie einen Cookie gesetzt haben. Beachten Sie
   jedoch, dass Sie durch das Blockieren von Werbeanzeigen die Quelle
   vieler Tracking-Cookies blockieren und am Ende einer privaten
   Browsersitzung beim Schließen des Browsers alle Cookies aus dieser
   Sitzung gelöscht werden.

   VPN ist ein kostenloser Dienst und die Menge der Daten, die Sie
   übertragen dürfen, ist unbegrenzt.

Privates Fenster

   Privates Fenster

   Privates Surfen stellt sicher, dass Ihr Internetverlauf und Ihre
   Aktivitäten entfernt werden, sobald Sie alle privaten Fenster
   schließen.

   Um Privat auf Mac zu surfen, wählen Sie Datei > Neues privates Fenster.

   Um privat auf Windows und Linux zu surfen, wählen Sie O-Menu > Neus
   privates Fenster.

   Wenn Sie alle privaten Fenster schließen, löscht Opera die folgenden
   zugeordneten Daten:
     * Browserverlauf
     * Objekte im Cache
     * Cookies

   Nach dem Schließen kann ein privater Tab oder ein privates Fenster
   nicht aus der Liste Zuletzt geschlossen im Tab-Menü wiederhergestellt
   werden.

   Während private Fenster keine Aufzeichnungen über die von Ihnen
   besuchten Webseiten hinterlassen, wenn Sie absichtlich Daten speichern,
   z. B. wenn Sie einen Eintrag auf Ihrer Kurzwahl speichern, ein Kennwort
   speichern oder eine Datei herunterladen, bleibt es nach dem Schließen
   des Fensters weiterhin sichtbar.

Private Daten löschen

   Standardmäßig speichert Opera bestimmte Browserdaten, um Verbindungen
   zu beschleunigen, allgemeine Seitenelemente zu laden und die
   Interaktion mit den von Ihnen besuchten Seiten zu verbessern.
   Möglicherweise möchten Sie Spuren Ihrer Surfgewohnheiten entfernen,
   indem Sie Ihre privaten Daten löschen.

   Mac-Nutzer: So löschen Sie private Daten
    1. Wählen Sie im Hauptmenü Opera > Browserdaten löschen….
    2. Wählen Sie aus dem Drop-down-Menü Die folgenden Elemente
       entfernen den Zeitraum aus, aus dem Sie die Verlaufselemente
       entfernen möchten.
    3. Aktivieren Sie die Kontrollkästchen neben den spezifischen
       Browserdaten, die Sie entfernen möchten.
    4. Klicken Sie auf Browserdaten löschen.

   Windows- und Linux-Benutzer: So löschen Sie private Daten
    1. Gehen Sie zu O-Menü > Verlauf > Browserdaten löschen.
    2. Wählen Sie aus dem Drop-down-Menü Die folgenden Elemente entfernen
       den Zeitraum aus, aus dem Sie die Verlaufselemente entfernen
       möchten.
    3. Aktivieren Sie die Kontrollkästchen neben den spezifischen
       Browserdaten, die Sie entfernen möchten.
    4. Klicken Sie auf Browserdaten löschen.

   Wenn Sie den Browserverlauf löschen, werden alle gespeicherten
   Standortinformationen über die von Ihnen aufgerufenen Seiten und die
   Zeiten, zu denen Sie auf sie zugegriffen haben, gelöscht.

   Wenn Sie den Download-Verlauf löschen, wird Operas Aufzeichnung der
   Dateien, die Sie über den Browser heruntergeladen haben, gelöscht.
   Dadurch wird die Datei nicht von Ihrem lokalen Computer gelöscht,
   sondern nur die Aufzeichnung, wann und wo Sie sie sie heruntergeladen
   haben.

   Durch das Löschen von Cookies und anderen Seitendaten werden alle Daten
   der verfolgten Seiten gelöscht. Lesen Sie hier mehr über die Verwaltung
   von Cookies.

   Wenn Sie den Cache Ihres Browsers leeren, werden vorübergehend
   zwischengespeicherte Daten von Webseiten gelöscht. Der Cache wird
   verwendet, um Seitenelemente wie Bilder oder Suchabfragen kurz zu
   speichern. Zwischengespeicherte Daten verringern außerdem die
   Ladezeiten, wenn Sie auf eine kürzlich besuchte Seite zugreifen
   möchten. Durch das Leeren des Cache wird Speicherplatz auf Ihrer
   lokalen Festplatte gelöscht.

   Beim Löschen von Daten aus gehosteten Apps werden alle Daten gelöscht,
   die von Erweiterungen gespeichert werden, die Sie im Browser
   installiert haben. Wenn Sie z. B. eine Wettererweiterung als Kurzwahl
   installiert haben und Ihren Standort in den Einstellungen festgelegt
   haben, setzt das Löschen dieser Daten die Erweiterung auf Ihre
   Standardeinstellungen zurück, und Sie müssen der Erweiterung Ihren
   Standort erneut mitteilen.
   Hinweis: Achten Sie darauf, dass Sie nicht versehentlich nützliche
   Daten löschen. Wenn es Ihnen noch nicht vertraut ist, versuchen Sie es
   mit privatem Surfen. Die Daten für das private Surfen werden
   automatisch gelöscht, wenn Sie alle privaten Fenster schließen.

   Verwalten wie Opera private Daten speichert, kann als Alternative zum
   Löschen aller privaten Daten nützlich sein. Lesen Sie mehr über die
   Einstellung von Web-Präferenzen.

Sicherheitsbuttons

   Opera warnt Sie vor verdächtigen Seiten, indem es die angeforderte
   Seite mit einer Datenbank bekannter „Phishing“ – und „Malware“
   -Webseiten vergleicht. Um sich bei der Eingabe vertraulicher
   Informationen zu schützen, suchen Sie immer nach dem Schloss im
   Sicherheitsbutton links neben der kombinierten Such- und Adressleiste.

   Buttons zeigen Details zu der angezeigten Seite an. Wenn ein Button in
   der kombinierten Such- und Adressleiste angezeigt wird, klicken Sie
   darauf, um weitere Informationen anzuzeigen, einschließlich
   Sicherheitszertifikate und mehr.

                  Symbol                    Zeigt Folgendes an:
   Button für beschleunigte Verbindung Komprimierte Verbindung
   Werbeblockerbutton                  Werbeanzeigen werden blockiert
   Kamerazugriffsbutton                Kamerazugriff
   Erweiterungsbutton                  Erweiterung
   Warnbutton                          Betrugs- oder Malware-Warnung
   Button für lokale Datei             Lokale Datei
   Standortbutton                      Standortzugriff
   Mikrofonbutton                      Mikrofonzugriff
   Operabutton                         Opera-Seite
   Button für sichere Verbindung       Sichere Verbindung
   Ungeschützt-Button                  Ungeschützte Verbindung
   MIDI-Button                         MIDI-Zugriff
   Aktiviertes VPN-Button              VPN ist aktiviert

   Wenn die Verbindung sicher ist, wird eine Sperre im Sicherheitsbutton
   angezeigt, was bedeutet, dass niemand die Informationen lesen kann, die
   zwischen Ihnen und der Webseite ausgetauscht werden. Opera verwendet
   Zertifikate, um die Identität der Seitenbesitzer zu überprüfen. Eine
   Sperre bedeutet, dass zwischen Ihnen und dem Empfänger eine gute
   Verschlüsselung besteht und die Identität des Empfängers überprüft
   wurde.

   Wenn eine Webseite auf die schwarze Liste gesetzt wird, wird eine
   Warnseite angezeigt, und Sie können entscheiden, ob Sie die Webseite
   besuchen oder sicher zur vorherigen Seite zurückkehren möchten.
   Betrugs- und Malware-Schutz verursacht keine Verzögerung beim Öffnen
   von Seiten.

Entsperren und erlauben Sie unsicheren Inhalt

   Wenn Sie beim Surfen eine verschlüsselte Verbindung (https://)
   verwenden, überprüft Opera, ob alle Teile der Webseite verschlüsselt
   sind. Wenn Opera erkennt, dass alle aktiven Elemente der Seite, z. B.
   Skripte, Plug-Ins oder Frames, von einer offenen Verbindung (http://)
   bedient werden, wird der unsichere Inhalt blockiert. Dies bedeutet,
   dass Teile der Seite möglicherweise nicht richtig angezeigt werden.

   Opera rät davon ab, dass unsicherer Inhalt in eine verschlüsselte
   Verbindung geladen wird. Der beste Schutz Ihrer vertraulichen
   Informationen besteht darin, nur mit sicheren Inhalten zu interagieren.
   Wenn Opera einen unsicheren Inhalt erkennt und diesen blockiert,
   erscheint auf der rechten Seite der kombinierten Adress- und Suchleiste
   eine Warnung.

   Wenn Ihnen die Sicherheit Ihrer Verbindung mit der Webseite nicht
   wichtig ist, können Sie auf die Warnung klicken, um die Schaltfläche
   Blockierung aufheben anzuzeigen. Mit dieser Schaltfläche können Sie den
   gesperrten Inhalt auf die Seite laden. Das Sicherheitsbutton wird
   geändert und zeigt ein geöffnetes Vorhängeschloss an, das Sie erinnern
   daran erinnert, dass Sie die Anzeige von unsicherem Inhalt auf einer
   verschlüsselten Verbindung zugelassen haben.

Sicherheitszertifikate verwalten

   Sicherheitszertifikate werden verwendet, um zu überprüfen, ob eine
   Webseite sicher zu verwenden ist. Die meisten Zertifikate sind
   uneingeschränkt gültig. Wenn Sie in der kombinierten Such- und
   Adressleiste ein grünes Vorhängeschloss-Button sehen, können Sie beim
   Surfen sicher fortfahren.

   Wenn Sie weitere Informationen zum Sicherheitszertifikat einer Webseite
   wünschen, klicken Sie auf das Sicherheitsbutton und wählen Sie Details.
   Opera wird den Aussteller des Zertifikats, die Art des Zertifikats und
   ob der Aussteller öffentlich bekannt und gültig ist, zusammenfassen.

   Öffentlich bekannte Aussteller und Ihre Zertifikate werden anhand einer
   Reihe von Sicherheits- und Identitätsprüfungen validiert. Opera warnt
   Sie, wenn ein Teil des Zertifikats eines öffentlich bekannten
   Ausstellers fragwürdig ist. Sie können zwar fortfahren, aber Opera kann
   Ihre Sicherheit nicht garantieren.

   So verwalten Sie Sicherheitszertifikate und wie Opera sie verarbeitet:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Einstellungen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Klicken Sie unter HTTPS/SSL auf die Schaltfläche Zertifikate
       verwalten.

Ein Hinweis zu lokalen Zertifikatausstellern

   Einige Verbindungen können durch Zertifikate lokaler Aussteller
   zertifiziert werden, entweder über Apps auf Ihrem Computer oder über
   andere nicht öffentliche Quellen (z. B. ein lokales Intranet). Diese
   Aussteller können verwendet werden, um gesicherte Verbindungen im
   Browser zu überprüfen. Die meisten dieser Verbindungen sind gültig.
   Beispielsweise können Debug-Anwendungen, Sicherheits-Scans von
   Drittanbietern und Jugendschutzfilter auf lokal ausgestellte
   Zertifikate zurückgreifen.

   Verbindungen, die durch Zertifikate von lokalen Ausstellern
   zertifiziert sind, unterliegen nicht den gleichen Sicherheitsstandards
   wie öffentlich bekannte Aussteller und Zertifikate. Eine solche
   Überprüfung ist zu streng und verhindert möglicherweise, dass die
   Verbindungen wie vorgesehen funktionieren. Malware oder Viren können
   diese Zertifikate verwenden, um verschlüsselte Informationen zu sehen
   oder Werbeanzeigen einzuschleusen.

   Wenn Sie möchten, können Sie Opera so konfigurieren, dass Sie vor
   öffentlichen Seiten gewarnt werden, die Zertifikate lokaler Aussteller
   verwenden. Wenn Sie weiterhin auf diesen Verbindungen surfen, müssen
   Sie darauf achten, dass einige Sicherheitsmaßnahmen wie
   Zertifikatsperrung und Zertifikattransparenz für alle diese
   Verbindungen während der Browsersitzung deaktiviert sind.

   Um zu betrachten, wie Sicherheitszertifikate verwaltet werden, klicken
   Sie hier.

Seiten anweisen, Ihre Aktivitäten nicht zu verfolgen

   Die meisten Seiten verfolgen Ihr Verhalten, während Sie diese besuchen.
   Wenn Ihnen diese Idee nicht gefällt, kann Opera bei jeder Anfrage einen
   zusätzlichen Kennsatz senden: “DNT: 1”. Dies ist eine Markierung für
   Webseiten, die der Nutzer nicht verfolgen möchte. Einige Länder haben
   eine DNT-Gesetzgebung, die Ihre Anfrage rechtlich schützt, und die
   meisten anständigen Webseiten werden diesen zusätzlichen Kennsatz
   respektieren.

   Sie können Opera so einstellen, dass Sie Seiten mitteilen, dass Sie es
   vorziehen, die Online-Verhaltensverfolgung zu deaktivieren. Um dies
   einzustellen:
    1. Gehen Sie zu Einstellungen (Präferenzen auf Mac).
    2. Klicken Sie in der Seitenleiste auf Datenschutz & Sicherheit.
    3. Aktivieren Sie unter Datenschutz das Kontrollkästchen Senden Sie
       eine „Nicht Verfolgungs“-Anfrage mit Ihrem Surf-Verkehr.

Bezpieczeństwo i prywatność

Blokowanie reklam

   Blokowanie reklam za pomocą wbudowanego w Operę ad blockera powoduje
   zablokowanie źródeł wielu ciasteczek śledzących aktywność, jak również
   nie pozwala na uruchamianie skryptów wydobywających kryptowalutę.

   Gdy blokowanie reklam jest włączone, na połączonym pasku adresu i
   wyszukiwania wyświetlana jest plakietka. Jeśli ją klikniesz, uzyskasz
   więcej informacji, w tym liczbę zablokowanych reklam, test szybkości
   oraz przełącznik umożliwiający odblokowanie reklam w danej witrynie.

   Aby nie dopuścić do wydobywania kryptowaluty ani do cryptojackingu na
   swoim komputerze, kliknij pole wyboru NoCoin (Ochrona przed tworzeniem
   kryptowalut). Dowiedz się więcej o wydobywaniu kryptowaluty i o
   sposobie, w jaki powstrzymujemy tutaj to zjawisko.

   Jeśli chcesz się dowiedzieć, w jaki sposób włączyć lub wyłączyć
   blokowanie reklam, kliknij tutaj.

VPN

   Zwykle przeglądarka łączy się z witrynami bezpośrednio, dzięki czemu
   mogą one określać Twój adres IP i jego przybliżoną lokalizację. W sieci
   VPN łączysz się z witrynami za pośrednictwem serwera VPN. W rezultacie
   Twoją pozorną lokalizacją staje się lokalizacja tego serwera.

   Aby włączyć sieć VPN:
    1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
    2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
    3. W sekcji VPN zaznacz opcję Włącz VPN.

   Po zaznaczeniu tej opcji połączenie VPN jest nawiązywane automatycznie,
   a na połączonym pasku adresu i wyszukiwania pojawia się niebieska
   plakietka VPN. Jeśli klikniesz tę plakietkę, zobaczysz przełącznik,
   informacje o ilości przesłanych danych, wirtualną lokalizację oraz
   wirtualny adres IP.

   Z punktu widzenia witryn Twoja przeglądarka znajduje się teraz w
   regionie określonym przez wirtualną lokalizację. Aby zmienić wirtualną
   lokalizację, wybierz region z listy. Jeśli nie wybierzesz żadnego
   regionu, przeglądarka automatycznie przypisze Cię do „optymalnej
   lokalizacji”. Aby wyłączyć połączenie VPN, zmień pozycję przełącznika.

   Z uwagi na to, że połączenie przeglądarki z serwerem VPN jest
   szyfrowane, nawet jeśli w Twojej lokalnej sieci nie ma szyfrowania, VPN
   zwiększa poziom prywatności w sieci lokalnej. Możesz ukryć swoją
   aktywność związaną z przeglądaniem przed innymi użytkownikami tej
   sieci.

   Aby zwiększyć poziom prywatności wobec witryn internetowych,
   utrudniając im śledzenie Twojej aktywności, musisz połączyć działanie
   kilku funkcji. Problemem są ciasteczka. Nawet jeśli ukryjesz swoją
   lokalizację, witryny wciąż mogą Cię rozpoznać, jeśli wcześniej ustawiły
   ciasteczko. Zwróć jednak uwagę, że blokując reklamy, blokujesz źródło
   wielu ciasteczek śledzących Twoją aktywność, a po zakończeniu sesji
   przeglądania prywatnego, gdy zamkniesz przeglądarkę, wszystkie
   ciasteczka z tej sesji są usuwane.

   VPN jest usługą darmową, a ilość danych, które możesz przesłać, jest
   nieograniczona.

   Pamiętaj, że VPN wpływa tylko na przeglądanie w przeglądarce Opera.
   Pozostałe oprogramowanie, takie jak inne przeglądarki, czy aplikacje do
   udostępniania plików P2P, nie są chronione.

Okno prywatne

   Tryb przeglądania prywatnego zapewnia usuwanie historii przeglądania i
   informacji o aktywności zaraz po zamknięciu wszystkich okien
   prywatnych.

   Aby rozpocząć przeglądanie prywatne na komputerze Mac, wybierz opcję
   Plik > Nowe okno prywatne.

   Aby rozpocząć przeglądanie prywatne w systemach Windows i Linux,
   wybierz z O Menu opcję Nowe okno prywatne.

   Po zamknięciu wszystkich okien prywatnych Opera wyczyści następujące
   dane:
     * Historia przeglądania
     * Elementy w pamięci podręcznej
     * Ciasteczka

   Zamkniętych kart i okien prywatnych nie można otworzyć ponownie z listy
   Ostatnio zamknięte w menu kart.

   Przeglądanie w oknach prywatnych nie pozostawia żadnych śladów
   dotyczących odwiedzanych witryn. Jednak dane, które zapiszesz celowo
   (np. elementy szybkiego wybierania, hasła, pobrane pliki), pozostaną
   widoczne nawet po zamknięciu okna.

Czyszczenie danych prywatnych

   Domyślnie Opera przechowuje niektóre dane przeglądania, aby
   przyspieszyć połączenia, szybciej wczytywać wspólne elementy stron i
   lepiej obsługiwać strony, które odwiedzasz. Możesz chcieć usunąć ślady
   swojej aktywności, usuwając dane prywatne.

   Aby wyczyścić dane prywatne dotyczące użytkowników komputerów Mac:
    1. Z menu głównego wybierz opcję Opera > Wyczyść dane przeglądania.
    2. Z menu rozwijanego Zakres czasu wybierz okres, z którego chcesz
       usunąć elementy historii.
    3. Zaznacz pola wyboru obok danych przeglądania, które chcesz usunąć.
    4. Kliknij opcję Wyczyść dane.

   Aby wyczyścić dane prywatne dotyczące użytkowników systemów Windows i
   Linux:
    1. Przejdź do O Menu > Historia > Wyczyść dane przeglądania.
    2. Z menu rozwijanego Zakres czasu wybierz okres, z którego chcesz
       usunąć elementy historii.
    3. Zaznacz pola wyboru obok danych przeglądania, które chcesz usunąć.
    4. Kliknij opcję Wyczyść dane.

   Wyczyszczenie historii przeglądania spowoduje usunięcie wszystkich
   informacji o odwiedzonych stronach, takich jak adresy i czasy
   odwiedzin.

   Wyczyszczenie historii pobierania spowoduje usunięcie informacji o
   plikach pobranych za pomocą przeglądarki. Z lokalnego komputera nie
   zostaną usunięte pobrane pliki, a jedynie informacje o czasie ich
   pobrania i ich lokalizacji źródłowej.

   Usunięcie ciasteczek i innych danych witryn spowoduje usunięcie
   wszystkich danych służących do śledzenia Twojej aktywności. Dowiedz się
   więcej o zarządzaniu ciasteczkami.

   Opróżnienie pamięci podręcznej przeglądarki spowoduje usunięcie
   wszystkich przechowywanych tymczasowo danych z witryn. Pamięć podręczna
   jest używana do krótkotrwałego przechowywania elementów strony, takich
   jak obrazy lub zapytania do wyszukania. Dane zapisane w pamięci
   podręcznej pozwalają również skrócić czasy wczytywania, gdy chcesz
   uzyskać dostęp do niedawno odwiedzonej witryny. Opróżnianie pamięci
   podręcznej zwalnia miejsce na dysku lokalnym.

   Wyczyszczenie danych hostowanych aplikacji spowoduje usunięcie
   wszystkich danych zapisanych przez zainstalowane w przeglądarce
   rozszerzenia. Jeśli na przykład masz zainstalowane rozszerzenie z
   prognozą pogody i jest w nim ustawiona Twoja lokalizacja, wyczyszczenie
   tych danych przywróci domyślne ustawienie rozszerzenia – konieczne
   będzie ponowne ustawienie lokalizacji.
   Uwaga: nie usuń przypadkowo przydatnych danych. Jeśli nie wiesz, do
   czego służą, wypróbuj przeglądanie w oknach prywatnych. Dane
   przeglądania prywatnego są automatycznie czyszczone po zamknięciu
   wszystkich okien prywatnych.

   Zarządzanie sposobem przechowywania danych prywatnych przez Operę może
   być użyteczną alternatywą dla czyszczenia wszystkich danych
   prywatnych. Dowiedz się więcej o preferencjach przeglądania.

Plakietki bezpieczeństwa

   Opera ostrzega przed podejrzanymi stronami. Otwierane strony sprawdzane
   są w bazie witryn znanych z oszukańczej działalności („phishing”) i
   oferowania złośliwego oprogramowania („malware”). Aby chronić swoje
   dane, podczas wprowadzania poufnych informacji zawsze szukaj plakietki
   bezpieczeństwa z lewej strony połączonego paska adresu i wyszukiwania.

   Plakietki pokazują szczegóły aktualnie przeglądanej strony. Gdy na
   połączonym pasku adresu i wyszukiwania pojawi się plakietka, kliknij
   ją, by wyświetlić więcej informacji, takich jak certyfikaty
   zabezpieczeń i inne.

   Ikona Oznacza…
   Plakietka przyspieszonego transferu Połączenie z zastosowaniem
   kompresji danych
   Plakietka blokowania reklam Reklamy są blokowane
   Plakietka dostępu do kamery Dostęp do kamery
   Plakietka rozszerzenia Rozszerzenie
   Plakietka ostrzeżenia Ostrzeżenie przed oszustwem lub złośliwym
   oprogramowaniem
   Plakietka pliku lokalnego Plik lokalny
   Plakietka lokalizacji Dostęp do lokalizacji
   Plakietka mikrofonu Dostęp do mikrofonu
   Plakietka Opery Strona Opery
   Plakietka bezpiecznego połączenia Bezpieczne połączenie
   Plakietka braku zabezpieczeń Niezabezpieczone połączenie
   Plakietka MIDI Dostęp do urządzeń MIDI
   Plakietka włączonej sieci VPN Połączenie VPN jest włączone

   Jeśli połączenie jest zabezpieczone, na plakietce bezpieczeństwa
   wyświetlana jest kłódka oznaczająca, że nikt inny nie może odczytać
   danych przesyłanych między Tobą a witryną. Tożsamość właściciela
   witryny jest weryfikowana przez Operę za pomocą certyfikatów. Kłódka
   oznacza dobre szyfrowanie między Tobą a odbiorcą oraz pozytywną
   weryfikację tożsamości odbiorcy.

   Jeśli witryna znajduje się na czarnej liście, zostanie wyświetlona
   strona z ostrzeżeniem. Możesz wtedy podjąć decyzję, czy chcesz
   odwiedzić tę witrynę czy też wrócić bezpiecznie do poprzedniej strony.
   Funkcja ochrony przed oszustwami i złośliwym oprogramowaniem nie
   powoduje opóźnień w otwieraniu stron.

Odblokowywanie i zezwalanie na niezabezpieczone treści

   Jeśli przeglądasz witrynę, używając połączenia szyfrowanego (https://),
   Opera sprawdza, czy wszystkie elementy witryny są szyfrowane. W
   przypadku wykrycia, że jakiekolwiek aktywne elementy strony, takie jak
   skrypty, wtyczki lub ramki, są przesyłane przez nieszyfrowane
   połączenie (http://), zostaną one zablokowane jako treści
   niezabezpieczone. Oznacza to, że niektóre elementy strony mogą nie być
   wyświetlane poprawnie.

   Zaleca się, aby nie zezwalać na wczytywanie niezabezpieczonych treści
   podczas korzystania z połączeń szyfrowanych. Najlepszym sposobem
   ochrony danych poufnych jest korzystanie z w pełni zabezpieczonych
   treści. Gdy Opera wykryje niezabezpieczone treści i je zablokuje, po
   prawej stronie połączonego paska adresu i wyszukiwania pojawi się
   ostrzeżenie.

   Jeśli bezpieczeństwo połączenia z daną witryną nie ma dla Ciebie
   znaczenia, możesz kliknąć to ostrzeżenie, aby wyświetlić przycisk
   Odblokuj. Po kliknięciu tego przycisku zablokowane treści zostaną
   wczytane, a plakietka bezpieczeństwa zmieni się w otwartą kłódkę, aby
   przypominać, że zezwolono na wyświetlanie niezabezpieczonych treści
   podczas korzystania z połączenia szyfrowanego.

Zarządzanie certyfikatami zabezpieczeń

   Certyfikaty zabezpieczeń służą do weryfikacji bezpieczeństwa witryn
   internetowych. Większość certyfikatów czasowych jest w pełni ważna.
   Jeśli na połączonym pasku adresu i wyszukiwania wyświetlana jest
   plakietka bezpieczeństwa z zieloną kłódką, możesz bezpiecznie
   kontynuować przeglądanie.

   Aby dowiedzieć się więcej o certyfikacie zabezpieczeń witryny, kliknij
   plakietkę bezpieczeństwa i wybierz opcję Szczegóły. Opera wyświetli
   podsumowanie dotyczące wystawcy i rodzaju certyfikatu oraz informacje o
   tym, czy wystawca jest publicznie znany i prawidłowy.

   Znani publicznie wystawcy i ich certyfikaty są poddawani wielu testom
   bezpieczeństwa i tożsamości. Jeśli pojawią się wątpliwości co do
   któregoś z elementów certyfikatu znanego publicznie wystawcy, Opera
   wyświetli ostrzeżenie. Możesz w takim przypadku kontynuować
   przeglądanie, jednak nie będzie wtedy pełnej gwarancji bezpieczeństwa.

   Aby zarządzać certyfikatami zabezpieczeń i sposobem ich obsługi przez
   Operę:
    1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
    2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
    3. W sekcji HTTPS/SSL kliknij przycisk Zarządzaj certyfikatami.

Kilka słów o wystawcach certyfikatów lokalnych

   Niektóre połączenia mogą być poświadczane z użyciem certyfikatów
   pochodzących od wystawców lokalnych, takich jak aplikacje zainstalowane
   na Twoim komputerze lub inne niepubliczne źródła (np. lokalny
   intranet). Za pomocą takich wystawców można weryfikować bezpieczne
   połączenia w przeglądarce. Większość takich połączeń jest prawidłowa.
   Wystawiane lokalnie certyfikaty mogą być na przykład używane podczas
   debugowania aplikacji, sprawdzania bezpieczeństwa zewnętrznych
   aplikacji oraz korzystania z filtrów kontroli rodzicielskiej.

   Połączenia poświadczane z użyciem certyfikatów pochodzących od
   lokalnych wystawców nie podlegają standardom kontroli obowiązującym w
   przypadku publicznie znanych wystawców i certyfikatów. Standardy te są
   zbyt restrykcyjne, co mogłoby prowadzić do nieprawidłowego działania
   połączeń. Tego typu certyfikaty mogą być wykorzystywane przez szkodliwe
   oprogramowanie i wirusy do podglądu szyfrowanych danych lub
   wstrzykiwania reklam.

   Możesz skonfigurować Operę tak, by wyświetlała ostrzeżenia, gdy witryny
   publiczne używają certyfikatów od wystawców lokalnych. Jeśli
   zdecydujesz się na kontynuowanie przeglądania w przypadku takich
   połączeń, musisz pamiętać, że niektóre środki bezpieczeństwa, takie jak
   przypinanie certyfikatu i transparentność certyfikatu, będą wyłączone
   podczas sesji przeglądania.

   Aby zapoznać się z zagadnieniem zarządzania certyfikatami zabezpieczeń,
   kliknij tutaj.

Sygnalizowanie witrynom, aby nie śledziły aktywności

   Większość witryn śledzi Twoją aktywność, gdy je przeglądasz. Jeśli nie
   życzysz sobie tego, Opera może wysyłać w każdym żądaniu dodatkowe pole
   nagłówka: „DNT: 1”. Flaga ta informuje witryny, że użytkownik nie życzy
   sobie być śledzony. W niektórych krajach żądanie DNT jest
   usankcjonowane prawnie, dzięki czemu prawa użytkowników są chronione, a
   większość dobrze zachowujących się witryn uznaje to żądanie.

   Możesz włączyć opcję informującą witryny, że nie życzysz sobie
   śledzenia Twoich zachowań. Aby to zrobić:
    1. Przejdź do opcji Ustawienia (Preferencje na komputerze Mac).
    2. Kliknij pozycję Prywatność i bezpieczeństwo na pasku bocznym.
    3. W sekcji Prywatność zaznacz pole wyboru Wysyłaj żądanie „Do not
       track” (bez śledzenia) podczas przeglądania.

Безопасность и конфиденциальность

Блокировка рекламы

   Блокируя рекламу, вы также блокируете множество отслеживающих файлов
   cookie и сценарии майнинга криптовалюты.


   При включенной блокировке рекламы в объединенной адресной строке и
   строке поиска будет отображаться значок. Нажмите на значок, чтобы
   увидеть дополнительные функции, включая количество заблокированных
   баннеров, тест скорости и переключатель, снимающий блокировку с
   отдельных сайтов.

   Чтобы предотвратить майнинг криптовалюты, или криптоджекинг, на вашем
   компьютере установите флажок NoCoin (Cryptocurrency Mining Protection)
   (NoCoin (защита от майнинга криптовалюты)). Узнать больше о майнинге
   криптовалюты и мерах, которые мы предпринимаем для его предотвращения.

   Чтобы узнать, как включать и отключать блокировку рекламы, нажмите
   здесь.

VPN

   В обычном режиме браузер соединяется с сайтами напрямую, позволяя им
   определять ваш IP-адрес и приблизительное местоположение. Включив VPN,
   вы соединяетесь с веб-сайтом через VPN-сервер. В результате ваше
   определяемое местоположение меняется на местоположение сервера.

   Для включения VPN выполните следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Privacy & security (Конфиденциальность и безопасность) на
       боковой панели.
    3. Слева от строки VPN установите флажок Enable VPN (Включить VPN).

   Это автоматически активирует VPN, и в комбинированной адресной строке и
   строке поиска появляется синий значок VPN. Нажатие на значок отображает
   переключатель, данные о количестве переданных данных, виртуальном
   местоположении и виртуальном IP-адресе.

   С точки зрения веб-сайтов, ваш браузер запущен в регионе виртуального
   местоположения. Для изменения виртуального местоположения выберите
   регион из списка. Если вы не выбрали страну, вам автоматически
   назначается «оптимальное местоположение». Для выключения VPN сдвиньте
   переключатель.

   Благодаря тому, что соединение с браузером зашифровано, VPN повышает
   защиту ваших личных данных в локальной сети, даже если соединение с ней
   не зашифровано. Вы можете скрыть от пользователей этой сети свои
   действия в ней.

   Чтобы повысить конфиденциальность при подключении к веб-сайтам и
   затруднить им задачу по получению ваших личных данных, одной только
   функции VPN недостаточно. Остается проблема файлов cookies. Даже если
   ваше местоположение скрыто, веб-сайты все еще могут вас
   идентифицировать с помощью файлов cookie. Однако следует учитывать, что
   блокировка рекламы позволяет избавиться от источника отслеживающих
   cookie, а если вы запускаете браузер в приватном режиме, все файлы
   cookie удаляются с устройства по окончании сессии, то есть после
   закрытия браузера.

   VPN – бесплатная услуга, и объем передаваемых данных не ограничен.

Приватное окно

   Приватное окно

   Приватный просмотр означает, что все сведения о вашей сетевой
   активности будут удалены из истории сразу после закрытия всех приватных
   окон.

   Чтобы перейти в режим приватного просмотра на Mac, выберите File
   (Файл) > New Private Window (Новое приватное окно).

   Чтобы перейти в режим приватного просмотра в Windows и Linux, выберите
   меню O > New private window (Новое приватное окно).

   Когда вы закроете все приватные окна, Opera удалит следующие связанные
   с ними данные:
     * Историю посещений;
     * Элементы в кэше;
     * Файлы cookie.

   Закрытую приватную вкладку или окно невозможно восстановить с помощью
   списка Recently Closed (Недавно закрытые) в меню вкладок.

   После использования приватных окон не сохраняется никакой информации о
   сайтах, которые вы посетили, однако если вы специально сохраните
   какие-либо данные, например, сайт на Экспресс-панели, пароль или файл,
   эти данные будут доступны и после закрытия окна.

Удаление личных данных

   По умолчанию Opera сохраняет определенные данные браузера, чтобы
   ускорить соединение с сайтами, быстрее загружать общие элементы страниц
   и в целом улучшить взаимодействие с посещаемыми вами сайтами. Если вы
   хотите удалить все следы своих действий в интернете, это можно сделать,
   удалив личные данные.

   Чтобы удалить личные данные, пользователям Mac необходимо выполнить
   следующие действия:
    1. В главном меню выберите Opera > Clear Browsing Data… (Очистить
       историю посещений…).
    2. Выберите период времени, историю за который вы хотите удалить, с
       помощью выпадающего меню Obliterate the following items from
       (Уничтожить следующие элементы).
    3. Установите флажки напротив конкретных данных браузера, которые вы
       хотите удалить.
    4. Нажмите Clear browsing data (Очистить историю посещений).

   Чтобы удалить личные данные, пользователям Windows и Linux необходимо
   выполнить следующие действия:
    1. Перейдите в меню O > History (История) > Clear browsing data
       (Очистить историю посещений).
    2. Выберите период времени, историю за который вы хотите удалить, с
       помощью выпадающего меню Obliterate the following items from
       (Уничтожить следующие элементы).
    3. Установите флажки напротив конкретных данных браузера, которые вы
       хотите удалить.
    4. Нажмите Clear browsing data (Очистить историю посещений).

   При очистке истории посещений будут удалены все сведения о
   просмотренных страницах, их адреса и время просмотра.

   При очистке истории загрузок Opera будут удалены все записи о
   загруженных файлах. Сами загруженные файлы не будут удалены с
   компьютера, браузер удалит только сведения о времени и месте загрузки.

   При удалении файлов cookie и других данных сайтов будут удалены все
   отслеживаемые сведениях о сайтах. Подробнее об управлении файлами
   cookie можно прочитать здесь.

   При очистке кэша браузера будут удалены все временно сохраненные данные
   сайтов. Кэш используется для временного хранения элементов страниц,
   таких как изображения или поисковые запросы. Кэшированные данные также
   помогают сократить время загрузки при повторном переходе на сайт.
   Очистка кэша позволяет освободить место на жестком диске.

   При очистке данных с веб-приложений будут удалены все данные, которые
   сохраняются расширениями, установленными в браузере. Например, если вы
   установили на Экспресс-панель расширение для получения прогноза погоды
   и указали в настройках этого расширения свое местонахождение, после
   очистки данных расширение вернется к настройкам по умолчанию, и вам
   снова надо будет ввести свое местонахождение.
   Примечание. Будьте внимательны и не удалите нужные данные. Вместо
   удаления данных вам, возможно, удобнее будет пользоваться приватным
   просмотром. Данные приватного просмотра удаляются автоматически, как
   только вы закроете все приватные окна.

   Вместо того чтобы постоянно удалять все личные данные, имеет смысл
   настроить параметры сохранения личных данных в Opera. Подробнее о
   настройке веб-предпочтений можно прочитать здесь.

Значки безопасности

   Opera предупредит вас о подозрительных страницах, проверив
   запрашиваемые вами страницы по базе известных «фишинговых» и
   вредоносных сайтов. Для обеспечения защиты при вводе конфиденциальной
   информации всегда обращайте внимание на замок в значке безопасности в
   левой части объединенной адресной строки и строки поиска.

   Значки показывают дополнительную информацию о просматриваемой странице.
   Когда значок появится в объединенной адресной строке и строке поиска,
   нажмите на него, чтобы просмотреть дополнительную информацию, включая
   сертификаты безопасности и т.п.

                Значок                      показывает, что
   Значок акселератора             Ускоренное соединение
   Значок блокировки рекламы       Реклама заблокирована
   Значок камеры                   Доступ к камере
   Значок расширения               Расширение
   Значок предупреждения           Мошеннический или вредоносный сайт
   Значок локального файла         Локальный файл
   Значок местоположения           Доступ к местоположению
   Значок микрофона                Доступ к микрофону
   Значок Opera                    Страница Opera
   Значок безопасного соединения   Безопасное соединение
   Значок незащищенного соединения Незащищенное соединение
   Значок MIDI                     Доступ к MIDI
   Значок включения VPN            VPN-соединение установлено

   Если соединение безопасное, замок на значке безопасности закрыт,
   показывая, что никто не может получить доступ к информации, которой вы
   обмениваетесь с данным сайтом. Opera использует сертификаты для
   проверки безопасности сайтов. Закрытый замок означает, что информация,
   которой вы обмениваетесь с получателем, надежно зашифрована, и личность
   получателя проверена.

   Если обнаружится, что веб-сайт есть в «черном списке», появится
   предупреждение, и вы сможете самостоятельно решить, посещать ли этот
   сайт или вернуться на предыдущую страницу. Система защиты от
   мошенничества и вредоносных программ не приводит к задержке при
   открытии страниц.

Разблокирование и разрешение просмотра небезопасного контента

   При просмотре страниц через зашифрованное соединение (https://) Opera
   проверяет, все ли части сайта зашифрованы. Если Opera обнаруживает, что
   какой-либо активный элемент на странице, например скрипт, плагин или
   фрейм, обслуживается через открытое соединение (http://), все
   небезопасное содержимое блокируется. Это означает, что страница может
   частично отображаться неправильно.

   Opera не рекомендует загружать небезопасное содержимое через
   зашифрованное соединение. Для защиты вашей конфиденциальной информации
   лучше всего взаимодействовать только с безопасным содержимым. Когда
   Opera обнаруживает небезопасное содержимое и блокирует его, в правой
   части объединенной адресной строки и строки поиска появляется
   соответствующее предупреждение.

   Если вас не беспокоит безопасность соединения с данным сайтом, нажмите
   на предупреждение, чтобы появилась кнопка Unblock (Разблокировать). Эта
   кнопка позволит загрузить заблокированное содержимое на страницу, и
   значок безопасности изменится на открытый замок, показывающий, что вы
   разрешили отображение небезопасного содержимого через зашифрованное
   соединение.

Управление сертификатами безопасности

   Сертификаты безопасности используются для проверки и подтверждения
   безопасности сайтов. В большинстве случае сертификаты сайтов полностью
   действительны. Если вы видите в объединенной адресной строке и строке
   поиска значок безопасности в виде зеленого замка, вы можете без
   опасений продолжать просмотр сайта.

   Если вам хочется узнать больше о сертификате безопасности сайта,
   нажмите значок безопасности и выберите Details (Подробности). Opera
   указывает издателя и тип сертификата, а также является ли издатель
   общеизвестным и действительным.

   Общеизвестные издатели и выпущенные ими сертификаты проходят ряд
   проверок на предмет подлинности и безопасности. Opera предупредит вас,
   если что-либо в сертификате общеизвестного издателя вызывает
   подозрения. Вы можете принять решение продолжить просмотр, однако Opera
   не сможет гарантировать вашу безопасность.

   Для управления сертификатами безопасности и их обработкой в Opera
   выполните следующие действия.
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Privacy & security (Конфиденциальность и безопасность) на
       боковой панели.
    3. В разделе HTTPS/SSL нажмите кнопку Manage Certificates (Управление
       сертификатами).

О локальных издателях сертификатов

   В некоторых случаях соединение может обладать сертификатом от
   локального издателя, например от приложения, установленного на вашем
   компьютере, или другого непубличного источника (например, локальной
   сети). С помощью этих издателей можно проверять безопасность соединения
   в браузере. Как правило, в этих случаях соединению можно доверять. На
   локальные сертификаты полагаются, например, приложения для отладки ПО,
   сторонние антивирусы и фильтры родительского контроля.

   Соединения с сертификатом от локального издателя не проверяются по
   стандартам для общеизвестных издателей и сертификатов. Вследствие своей
   строгости они могут привести к неправильной работе соединения. С
   помощью таких сертификатов вредоносные программы и вирусы могут
   навязывать вам рекламу и получать доступ к зашифрованной информации.

   При желании вы можете настроить в Opera предупреждения о публичных
   сайтах, использующих сертификаты от локальных издателей. Продолжая
   пользоваться такими соединениями, учитывайте, что некоторые меры
   безопасности, например запоминание сертификатов и Certificate
   Transparency, будут отключены для них на время сеанса.

   Чтобы узнать подробнее об управлении сертификатами безопасности,
   нажмите здесь.

Как запретить сайтам отслеживать ваши действия

   Большинство сайтов во время их посещения отслеживают все совершаемые на
   них действия. Если вы не хотите быть объектом слежения, Opera может
   отправлять дополнительный заголовок с каждым запросом: «DNT: 1». Это
   своего рода предупреждение для сайтов о том, что пользователь не хочет
   быть объектом слежения. В некоторых странах использование DNT
   регулируется законодательством и большинство законопослушных владельцев
   сайтов соблюдают право пользователей на защиту с помощью такого
   дополнительного заголовка.

   Если вы хотите отказаться от отслеживания ваших действий в сети, можно
   настроить Opera соответствующим образом. Для этого выполните следующие
   действия:
    1. Перейдите в Settings (Настройки) (Preferences (Настройки) на Mac).
    2. Нажмите Privacy & security (Конфиденциальность и безопасность) на
       боковой панели.
    3. В разделе Privacy (Конфиденциальность) установите флажок Send a ‘Do
       Not Track’ request with your browsing traffic (Отправлять сайтам
       заголовок «Не отслеживать»).
