Privacy Policy

Orreco Privacy Policy


INTRODUCTION


About Us.

   Orreco Limited (“Orreco”) is a private company limited by shares
   incorporated in Ireland with company number 478047 and having a
   registered office at Unit 103, Research and Innovation Centre, NUI
   Galway, Newcastle Road, Galway (“we”/ “us”). We provide sports
   analytics, tools, applications and products to generate customised
   indicators of injury, optimise training, recovery and nutrition
   strategies for athletes (the “Services”).


About our Privacy Policy.

   We respect your right to privacy and take seriously our
   responsibilities in relation to the processing of personal data. We do
   not collect or process personal data unnecessarily.


   This privacy policy (the “Policy”) sets out important information about
   your rights in relation to the processing of your personal data, and
   the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you
   provide to us, will be processed in connection with your use of this

   App (the “FitrWoman App”) and/or the Services. We do not knowingly
   attempt to solicit or receive information from children.


Controller.

   Under this Policy, and unless we have entered into a different
   agreement with you, we will be what’s known under the General Data
   Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) as the “controller” of
   the personal data you provide to us. Subscribers to the App will
   normally enter into a different agreement in relation to their use of
   the App and in this case we would act as processor and the user or
   coach would be the controller.

   We will collect and process the following data about you for the
   following purposes:

   ‍

   Your Data. This is information about you that you give us by filling in

       or using the Services and/or the App.

   person’s ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
   beliefs, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely
   identifying a natural person and data concerning your mental or
   physical health.


   Special categories of data, including Health Data, may be collected by

Change of purpose.

   We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we
   collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
   another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
   If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new
   purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us
   at info@orreco.com. If we need to use your personal data for an
   unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal
   basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your
   personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with
   this Policy, where this is required or permitted by law.


How long we keep your information.

   We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
   fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
   satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. This means
   that the period of time for which we store your personal data may
   depend on the type of data we hold. To determine the appropriate
   retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
   sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from
   unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for
   which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
   purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
   requirements. For example, we may hold personal data as needed for our
   accounting or tax compliance purposes for a period of 6 years. For more
   information about our data retention policies please contact us
   at info@orreco.com.


DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION


   We do not sell your personal information to third parties for marketing
   purposes. We may disclose information to third parties if you consent
   to us doing so as well as in the following circumstances:


   You agree that we have the right to share your personal information
   with the following recipients or categories of recipients:


     * Any department or authorised person within our company or any
       member company within our group, which means any subsidiary or
       holding company within the meaning of sections 7 and 8 of the
       Companies Act 2014.


     * Selected third parties including:

   ·       business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors, including
   authorised coaches, for the performance of any contract we enter into
   with them or you in relation to the Services; and

   ·       analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the
   improvement and optimisation of our Site.


   We will disclose your personal information to third party recipients:


     * in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which
       case we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller
       or buyer of our business or assets;
     * if all or substantially all of our business or assets are acquired
       by or transferred to a third party whether in the event of a
       merger, reorganisation, transfer of undertakings, receivership,
       liquidation or other winding up or any other similar circumstances,
       in which case personal data held by us will be one of the
       transferred assets;
     * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in
       order to comply with any law, legal obligation or court order, or
       in order to enforce rights under the GDPR or any other applicable
       laws, regulations or agreements;
     * to protect our rights, property or safety and of our customers, or
       others. This includes exchanging information with other companies
       and organisations for the maintenance and security of the Site and
       Services.


INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS


   Personal Data may be transferred to our trusted partners and service
   providers who maintain their servers outside of the European Economic
   Area (“EEA”), where the privacy and data protection laws may not be as
   protective as those in your jurisdiction. This is only for the purposes
   of providing, and to the extent necessary to provide, the Services to
   you. There are special requirements set out under Chapter V of the GDPR
   (with which we would comply) to regulate such data transfers and ensure
   that adequate security measures are in place to safeguard and maintain
   the integrity of your personal data on transfer.


   For more information about this and the safeguards in place relating to
   the transfer, please contact us by email at info@orreco.com.


SECURITY MEASURES


   We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
   personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
   unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to
   your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other
   third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process
   your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty
   of confidentiality.


   We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
   data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
   breach where we are legally required to do so.


YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND YOUR RIGHTS


Accessing your Personal Data.

   You may request access at any time to a copy of the personal data we
   hold about you. Any such request should be submitted to us in writing
   and sent to info@orreco.com. We will need to verify your identity in
   such circumstances and may request more information or clarifications
   from you if needed to help us locate and provide you with the personal
   data requested.


   There is usually no charge applied to access your personal data (or to
   exercise any of the other rights). However, if your request is clearly
   unfounded, repetitive or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee.
   Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
   circumstances.


Right of Restriction.

   You may restrict us from processing your personal data in any of the
   following circumstances:
     * you have contested the accuracy of the personal data we hold on
       record in relation to you or for a period of time to enable us to
       verify the accuracy of the personal data;
     * the processing of your personal data is unlawful and you request
       the restriction of use of the personal data instead of its erasure;
     * we no longer require your personal data for the purpose of
       processing but you require this data for the establishment,
       exercise or defence of legal claims; or
     * where you have contested the processing (under Article 21(1) of the
       GDPR) pending the verification of our legitimate grounds.


Corrections or Erasure (Right to Rectification and Right to Be Forgotten).

   If we hold personal data concerning you which are no longer necessary
   for the purposes for which they were collected or if you withdraw
   consent for us to process your personal data, you can request the
   deletion of this personal data. This right, however, will not apply
   where we are required to process personal data in order to comply with
   a legal obligation or where the processing of this information is
   carried out for reasons of public interest in the area of public
   health. If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate,
   you may request to have your personal information updated and
   corrected. To do so at any time, please contact us by email
   at info@orreco.com.


Your Right to Object.

   You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at
   any time:


     * for direct marketing purposes
     * for profiling to the extent it relates to direct marketing
     * where we process your personal data for the purposes of legitimate
       interests pursued by us, except where we can demonstrate compelling
       legitimate grounds for this processing which would override your
       interests, rights and freedoms or in connection with the
       enforcement or defence of a legal claim.


   To exercise your right to object at any time, please
   email info@orreco.com.


   Should this occur, we will no longer process your personal data for
   these purposes unless doing so is justified by a compelling legitimate
   ground as described above. For more information about our marketing
   practices, please see the Marketing Communications section below.


Data Portability.

   Where we process your personal data by automated means (i.e., not on
   paper) and this processing is based on your consent or required for the
   performance of a contract between us, you have the right to request
   from us a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used
   machine-readable format and, where technically feasible, to request
   that we transmit your personal data in this format to another
   controller.


Profiling.

   Profiling is an automated form of processing of personal data often
   used to analyse or predict personal aspects about an individual person.
   This could relate to a person’s performance at work, economic
   situation, health, personal preferences, reliability, behaviour,
   location or movements. An example of this would be where a bank uses an
   automated credit scoring system to assess and reject a loan
   application.


   You have the right to be informed if your personal data will be subject
   to automated decision making, including profiling. You also have the
   right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated
   process, including profiling, where that decision impacts on your legal
   rights. There are some exceptions to this rule, where, for example, the
   decision is necessary in connection with the performance of a contract
   between us, is authorised by law or where you have given your explicit
   consent to this automated processing.


Personal Rights.

   The rights described in this section are personal rights and are
   exercisable only by the individual person (or data subject) concerned.


MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS

General.

   We will not use your data to send marketing communications to you about
   promotions, competitions, updates and new products or services that may
   be of interest to you, unless we have your permission to do so.

Your right to object.

   You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data
   for our marketing purposes. To object or if you change your mind at any
   later time, you can withdraw your consent to the processing of your
   personal data for such marketing purposes by contacting us
   at info@orreco.com. You may also opt out of receiving marketing
   communications at any time by selecting the unsubscribe option when you
   receive an electronic marketing communication from us. The withdrawal
   of your consent will not impact upon the lawfulness of processing based
   on your consent prior to the withdrawal.

   ‍

THIRD PARTY MATERIAL

   We always endeavour to deal with vendors and other third parties who
   are GDPR compliant or, in the case of the third parties located outside
   of the EEA, who are certified as compliant with the EU-US Privacy
   Shield, as applicable, or who have adequate security measures in place
   to safeguard the security of personal data. That said, we, our
   employees, agents, holding company and subsidiaries, accept no
   liability howsoever arising for the content or reliability of any third
   party materials or websites referenced by hyperlink or other means on
   the Site or for the data collection and use practices or security
   measures used by such third parties. If you submit personal data to any
   of those sites, your personal data is governed by their privacy policy.
   We encourage you to carefully read their privacy policies.


CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

   Any changes made to this Policy from time to time will be published at
   the Site.

   Any material or other change to the data processing operations
   described in this Policy which is relevant to or impacts on you or your
   personal data, will be notified to you in advance by email. In this
   way, you will have an opportunity to consider the nature and impact of
   the change and exercise your rights under the GDPR in relation to that
   change (e.g., to withdraw consent or to object to the processing) as
   you see fit.
