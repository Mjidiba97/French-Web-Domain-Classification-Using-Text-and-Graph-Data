New Milani Eyeshadow Palettes - Bold Obsessions and Most Loved Mattes

   [BoldObsessions.jpg]
   I stumbled upon these beauties in my local drugstore but they were
   totally sold out! Bummer, but only for a few days until I was able to
   order them directly from Milani's website at $20 each.  The palettes in
   the store were sold out, but they still had sample palettes to play
   with and swatch.  The colors looked so pretty and the golden glitter
   was calling my name.

   Each palette has 12 shadows and are cased in a mirrored gold finish.
   They also include a full size mirror.

   What's even better are the shadows inside.  Below is the Bold
   Obsessions palette.  Can you see why I'm crazy over the gold? It's even
   more beautiful in person.  This palette is a combo of shimmers and
   mattes, perfectly balanced to create numerous looks.

   A closer view of Obsessions.
   [Milani%2BBold%2BObesessions.jpg]
   The Most Loved Mattes palette is also beautiful, but many of the shades
   are close to my skin tone.  I just wish there were a few darker shades
   to create more of a contrast.
   [Milani%2BMattes.jpg]
   After swatching I see more contrast but I still wish there were a few
   more dark colors!  I do like that there are several shades of beige (50
   shades of beige, lol) because I find they all look different against my
   skin tone.  It's tricky to find just the right shade that serves as a
   base color and has some color correcting properties to help with the
   darkness of my lids.
   [MilaniMattes.jpg]
   The palettes look and feel high quality.  The performance of the Bold
   Obsessions palette surprised me.  I tried 6 of the shadows and they
   applied and blended very easily.  They are pigmented and have great
   color payoff.  I also like the matte palette but honestly I have not
   used it yet.
   I think these are a great buy for what you are getting.  Their quality
   rivals some of the higher end brands at half the price!

Impress Manicure Christian Siriano Collection

   [Pink%2BNails.jpg]
   Hey beauties! Today I want to share Impress Manicure "press on nails"
   with you, specifically, the Christian Siriano collection.  I've been
   rocking Impress Nails over the last few months and as a fan of Project
   Runway I was extremely excited to discover Christian designed a line
   for the company.
   [Impress.jpg]
   The great thing about his collection is that most of them are
   metallic-ey.  A small accomplish but nice because most press on nails
   are usually opaque.  Christian's nails are glossy, metallic and there's
   even a holographic set.  I choose 3 from the collection but I will be
   purchasing more as they are limited edition.
   [PurpleNails.jpg]
   Here's the holographic set, Stained Glass. I tried to show how they
   look different depending on how the light hits them.  I got soooooooooo
   many compliments on this set.
   [Pink%2BNails.jpg]
   The lace chrome set (Lacey Rose) is equally adorable and great for
   Valentines.
   As usual the nails lasted all week!  The down side is that Lacey Rose
   started to chip/peel at about day five.  Overall I'm really impressed
   with these press ons.  Christian did a fabulous job!
   The Christian Siriano Collection is only available online at
   impressmanicure.com.

   previous years and I must admit I am tempted.  The offer is good until

Too Faced Chocolate Gold Eyeshadow Palette - Swatches and Review

   [ChocGoldThumb.jpg]
   [cbone.jpg]
   The Chocolate Gold eyeshadow palette is the latest from
   Too Faced's plethora of fall releases.  The layer of melted gold
   embedded on top of the chocolate bar immediately caught my attention
   and drew me in.
   [cbtwo.jpg]
   The palette has the typical chocolate bar semi-random format of 16
   shadows (2 extra large).   There's real gold inside, where and what
   colors, I'm not sure.
   [CG%2BPic%2B1.jpg]
   At first glance the theme of the palette seems colorful, but when you
   subtract the bright purple and green everything else is pretty neutral.
    Here's swatches of the first half of the palette.  Chocolate Gold, the
   large transition shade, is a little too bright for my taste but would
   probably add to a dramatic holiday look.  I'm loving the fifth color
   here, Old Money, a golden bronze.  New Money, the bright purple, is
   gorgeous and would be a fun summer shade to sport.  All of the
   colors swatched here are shimmers.
   [CG%2BPic%2B2.jpg]
   With the second half of the swatches, you can really see how neutral
   the palette is.  This is a combo of shimmer and mattes.  I'm loving the
   look of Famous (warm gold) and Classy&Sassy (rose gold).  Rollin' in
   Dough is a little too light for me to use as a transition shade but so
   So Boujee is perfect.
   After the disappointment of the White Chocolate Bar, I didn't have high
   expectations of this palette, but I was pleasantly surprised.  So far I
   have used 6 shades and they applied and blended beautifully. Matte
   lovers may not be drawn to the palette since it's mostly shimmers.  I
   usually were mattes, but the pop of brights and the shiny gold drizzle
   drew me in.
   The Chocolate Gold palette is available for $49 at TooFaced.com and
   other retailers that carry the brand.

New Fall Drugstore Makeup: Milani Metallics

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2017-11-12%2Bat%2B5.24.37%2BPM.png]
   Hey beauties! I stumbled upon, the new Milani Metallics at my local
   drugstore.  They appear to be part of their Holiday collection (or
   marketed as such) because they were in a separate display.   I choose
   one shadow palette and lip creme from the collection.
   [shadow%2Bpalette.jpg]
   The shadow palette I choose is Metallic 08 Must Have Metallics Everyday
   Eyes
   [milani%2Bmattes.jpg]
   The swatches are really speaking for themselves. This palette is like a
   mini UD Heat palette but better.  All of the colors are gorgeous!
   [eyes%2Bpic%2B2.jpg]
   Eye look I created with the palette.

   Milani Metallic Lip Cream: Making Me Matte

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBvCch1KzjY?feature=player_embedded

   Video on the above look.
   There were 2 lip cremes in the Holiday display.  I chose the darker
   color Making Me Matte, because I thought it would go along better with
   the eyeshadow.  There was also a lighter lip creme available.  Like the
   name suggests the lippie is metallic.  The best thing about it, is that
   it lasts all day!  The down side is that it can be drying. I countered
   that by applying lip balm first.
   I've been using these 2 products all week and I'm pleasantly surprised.
   The palette consists of 5 shimmers and one matte black and can be used
   alone to create an everyday or dramatic evening look. I normally don't
   wear shimmers as an all over/transition color, but surprisingly it
   worked!  Color 1, the largest color in the palette, is a shimmer and I
   was able to use it as an all over/transition color.  It's very
   pigmented and helped to camouflage my dark circles.   The orange and
   red (colors 3 and 4) blend effortlessly and the gold (color 2) was
   great as an inner eye shade.   Of course you can mix and match them
   however you choose.  Overall, I'm impressed with the performance of
   these products.  Definitely worth the ten bucks, but an even better
   deal if you can catch them at BOGO 50% off!

Anastasia Beverly Hills Prism Palette

   [PRISM4.jpg]
   Today I have the new Anastasia Beverly Hills Prism palette to share
   with you.  I purchased it from the ABH website and it arrived a few
   days later.  The swatches online had me excited about this palette
   because they seem to look good on every skin tone.
   [prism%2B1.jpg]
   Here's the palette alone.  There are an equal number of mattes and
   glitter/shimmers.  I'm not sure why they positioned them in the palette
   scattered, instead of putting glitters in one row and mattes in the
   second row.
   [prism%2B3.jpg]
   The first row is my least favorite. The white glitter is somewhat sheer
   and I can't imagine when I would use the bright neon yellow.  The
   purple glitter (osiris) is also on the sheer side.  My favs from this
   row are eden (peach) and obsidian (black). Holly bat man, this black is
   pigmented.
   Names left to right: lucid, eden, unity, sphinx, osiris, sphere and
   obsidian.
   [prism2.jpg]
   The second row is my favorite from the palette.  Dimension
   (grey/purple) is a gorgeous shimmer and I can imaging a glamourous
   smokey eye with it.  Pyramid and eternal are very wearable shimmers
   since the colors are in the neutral family.  Throne is a gorgeous green
   and I choose it for this look.
   Names from left to right: dimension, parallel, pyramid, throne, saturn,
   eternal and lupe
   I like this palette but I was a bit deflated after swatching the first
   row and having difficulty picking up some of the colors.  The shadows
   that I used for the above look applied and blended very easily (unity,
   eden, throne and obsidian).  The mattes feel soft and buttery.  The
   shimmer/glitters are nice but the white and purple will require some
   work to build up (if you don't use a colored base)
     This is a predominantly a neutral palette with a few pops of color
   thrown in for interest: green, purple and neon yellow.  I would equate
   this palette to the Subculture palette as far as style and value.
   The Prism palette is available on Anastasia Beverly Hills and Sephora.
