About CentOS:

   The Community ENTerprise Operating System (CentOS) Linux is a
   community-supported enterprise distribution derived from sources freely
   provided to the public by Red Hat. As such, CentOS Linux aims to be
   functionally compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The CentOS
   Project is the organization that builds CentOS. We mainly change
   packages to remove upstream vendor branding and artwork.

   For information on CentOS please visit the CentOS website.

   CentOS is an Operating System and it is used to power this website;
   however, the webserver is owned by the domain owner and not the CentOS
   Project. If you have issues with the content of this site, contact the
   owner of the domain, not the CentOS Project.

   Unless this server is on the centos.org domain, the CentOS Project
   doesn't have anything to do with the content on this webserver or any
   e-mails that directed you to this site.
