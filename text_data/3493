HFSPO Privacy Policy

   15 April 2019

   The International Human Frontier Science Program Organization (HFSPO)
   was established in 1989 to promote innovative, cutting edge research at
   the frontiers of the life sciences through international collaboration
   in the spirit of science without borders and for the benefit of
   humankind. It is governed by the Board of Trustees composed of
   appointees from HFSPO Members, currently Australia, Canada, France,
   Germany, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, the Republic of
   Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
   Northern Ireland, the United States of America and the European
   Commission.

   This privacy policy explains how HFSPO uses the information collected
   via its website (http://www.hfsp.org/ ) and via the proposal submission
   process based on the online application tool
   (https://extranet.hfsp.org/ ).

   HFSPO is committed to safeguarding your personal information and this
   policy explains what kind of personal data we collect, store, and use
   from applicants and awardees of HFSP funding programs for the purpose
   of award selection through peer review (committee members and external
   reviewers), award management, and the statutory requirements for
   reporting to the HFSPO Members.

   HFSPO will collect and use your information where it is necessary for
   us to pursue our statutory mandate to provide research funds and where
   your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.

   Visiting the public HFSP website (www.hfsp.org)

   When you visit the HFSP website the following data are logged: your
   browser, operating system, IP address, the date and time of your visit,
   the pages visited, and the amount of data transferred.

   We collect this information to monitor suspicious outside activities
   (hacking of the site), to diagnose problems on the HFSP site (in
   particular the online application platform), and to create anonymous
   usage statistics. HFSPO does not use this data to identify or profile
   people. Allowing the HFSP website and extranet platform to remain
   secure and robust constitutes our lawful basis for collecting the data.

   The personal data is only accessible to selected HFSPO staff who,
   according to HFSPO internal regulations, maintain the website and the
   technical support staff of OCI and Prodware (third party processors of
   HFSPO).

   The data collected via the HFSP website is located on a server in the
   HFSP Secretariat in Strasbourg, and is not transferred to any other
   party. HFSPO will keep web logs for which information is archived after
   30 days. We use this information to improve our website and provide a
   better experience for our visitors. The information is available only
   to our web managers and staff who require it to perform their duties.

   The teams from OCI and Prodware have access to the HFSP servers to
   provide regular technical support for development and fixing problems.
   They do not have access to treat personal data of website visitors.
   Further information about their privacy statements is available at
   https://www.oci.fr/ and https://www.prodware.fr/

   Submitting a research proposal for an HFSP award

   When submitting a proposal for an HFSP Research Grant, Fellowship or
   Career Development Award we may collect the following information from
   you in your role as the applicant/investigator, co- investigator, host
   supervisor, or referee via our extranet portal:
     * first name, last name, academic title and degree, ORCID ID, date of
       birth;
     * nationality;
     * address, email address, telephone and fax numbers;
     * CV including education/training and career history;
     * information relating to career breaks. We will not request any
       specific health-related information;
     * letters of support;
     * details of proposal.

   We may ask for additional information about you relating to your
   application from external sources, e.g. other pending grants or
   support, publications, patents or clinical trials. We may also collect
   information about you and your research proposal from external
   reviewers and advisors (e.g. external mail reviewers and review
   committee members).

   All this information is used for selecting and managing the HFSP awards
   but also to report on the kind of research that HFSP funds. The
   information is also required to assess the achievements of HFSPO as a
   global funding organization of frontier research.

   We use your information for:
     *
          + displaying your award on the HFSP website;
          + the administration of your HFSP account on our extranet
            platform which provides password protected access for the
            submission of your proposal;
          + processing your application and assessing your eligibility and
            suitability for HFSP funding;
          + reviewing your application using external mail reviewers
            and/or members of the three HFSP review committees;
          + administration within our award database.

   HFSP will share your information for the purpose of:
     *
          + reporting, e.g. award rates and trends in application
            decisions;
          + evaluating and reporting (where it could be combined with
            other data), e.g. the fairness and efficiency of application
            decisions; and
          + research and outcome analyses (where it could be combined with
            other data), e.g. to determine the geographical reach of
            institutions that HFSP funds.

   We may share your information for these purposes with individuals and
   organizations outside HFSPO who are connected to or who work on behalf
   of HFSPO, for example, members of the HFSPO Board of Trustees or
   individuals that review HFSPO activities, some of whom may be based
   outside of the EEA.

   HFSPO’s legal basis for collecting and sharing the above mentioned data
   is our statutory mandate to act as a funding organization for
   international research collaboration, which vests us official authority
   to process your data.

   Information that HFSPO collects about its awardees

   In addition to the data collected during the submission process, HFSPO
   will collect the following information from you when you are awarded an
   HFSP Research Grant, Fellowship or Career Development Award:
     *
          + the banking information of your research institution;
          + with your consent, information relating to date of birth and
            gender;
          + with the consent of HFSP fellows, data on personal life
            (marital status and number of children) as this may result in
            additional financial support;
          + financial reports detailing the spending of HFSP funds;
          + annual reporting relating to scientific achievements;
          + information relating to unforeseen delays such as parental
            leave, extended sick leave or any other such circumstances.

   All this information is collected for the sole purpose of award
   management and will not be shared with other individuals or
   organizations.

   HFSPO publishes information about its awardees, such as awardee name,
   institutional affiliation, title of the research project, and research
   achievements on its public website and in the HFSPO Annual Report. The
   legal basis for disseminating this information is our statutory mandate
   to act as a funding organization for international research
   collaboration.

     * email address;
     * your photo;
     * institutional address;
     * ORCID id and Linkedin profile link;
     * other information relating to research activities.

   We use your information for:
     * creating your account on the alumni platform;

   HFSPO’s legal basis for collecting and sharing the above-mentioned data
   is your explicit consent, which you can withdraw at any moment by
   changing the settings in your alumni account or by contacting us at
   dpo@hfsp.org.

   Duration of data storage

   We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to
   fulfil the purposes for which we collected it. This may mean retaining
   your personal information for a period after the tenure of your HFSP
   award for the purposes of satisfying legal, accounting, or reporting
   requirements.

   For the purpose of archiving, we permanently archive certain
   information, which we hold within our organizational archives. This is
   information that supports the planning of HFSPO’s resources and funding
   activities.

   Cookie settings

   Like many other sites, HFSPO’s internet pages use cookies. These are
   text files that are stored on your computer when you use an Internet
   browser.

   Cookies contain a unique identifier, the cookie ID, which consists of a
   character string, permitting Internet pages and servers to recognize
   your particular browser through its unique ID number.

   HFSPO mainly uses cookies to provide visitors to our website with more
   user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie
   setting. For example, users may not have to enter their login details
   each time the website is accessed, because they can be recognized by
   the information in the cookie.

   However, HFSPO also uses Google Analytics cookies to analyze its
   traffic. This cookie is managed by Google Inc., a company which is part
   of the Privacy Shield agreement between the European Union and the
   United States of America. By using this cookie, Google Inc. collects
   your IP address as well as technical data on the way you use our
   website. For more information on Google Analytics, please refer to
   Google’s privacy policy at
   https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245.

   Users, whether they are applicants to HFSP funding programs or visitors
   to the HFSP website, may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies
   for our website through a setting on the Internet browser used. They
   may thus permanently deny the placing of cookies. Furthermore, cookies
   already set may be deleted at any time via the browser’s user menu
   settings or other software. However, if a user or visitor deactivates
   cookie settings, not all functions of the HFSP website may function
   properly.

   Your rights

   As an applicant to HFSP funding programs and as an HFSP awardee you
   have certain rights over your personal data. Further information on
   your rights and how to exercise them is set out below. If you have an
   HFSP online account with us for the purpose of proposal submission, we
   hope that you will find that your information is easy to access and
   update as it is important that the personal information we hold about
   you is accurate and current.

   You have the right to:
     * request access to your personal information. This enables you to
       receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to
       check that we are lawfully processing it;
     * request correction of the personal information that we hold about
       you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate
       information we hold about you corrected;
     * request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to
       ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no
       good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the
       right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information,
       should you have exercised your right to object to processing (see
       below);
     * object to the processing of your personal information where we are
       relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third-party) and
       where there is something about your particular situation which
       makes you want to object to processing on these grounds;
     * request the restriction of processing of your personal information.
       This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your
       personal information, for example if you want us to establish its
       accuracy or the reason for processing it;
     * request the transfer of your personal information to another party;
     * withdraw your consent for us to use your personal information at
       any time.

   If you would like to exercise any of the rights mentioned above, please

   that you request from HFSPO will be made available by electronic means
   using technology that relies on secure data transfer protocols.
