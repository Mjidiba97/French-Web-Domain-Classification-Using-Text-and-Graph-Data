The BeeMonitor with permanent scale

   The BeeMonitor prototype has been up and running sinds march 2017
   without any big issue’s, in the mean time some hardware/software
   upgrades were made. A complete new Arduino compatible Arduino
   bootloader allows faster startup even at very low voltages.

   Because the battery life was very promising I decided to add a load
   cell for a permanent scale and keep track of the beehive weight. The
   result is a wireless BeeMonitor + scale without external power or
   wires. The beehives can be placed everywhere within range of the
   gateway. Reference measurements indicate the two AAA batteries will
   keep the BeeMonitor powered for at least one year, collecting data
   every 15 minutes! Awesome!

   Setup: BeeMonitor prototype with internal beehive temperature sensor
   and permanent half-scale

   The scale is based on the half-scale principal. It’s designed to weigh
   only half the hive, making the design simpler because only 1 (high
   quality) load-cell is required. This design finally makes monitoring
   beehives affordable!

   There’s a on-the-go calibration procedure. The scale can be calibrated
   in the field by following a couple of steps, without the need of
   re-programming.

   Temperature graphs

   The graph below shows the ambient temperature (outside beehive, shade)
   vs. beehive cluster temperature (inside beehive). Past days have been
   mostly wet with almost no sunshine. The cluster temperature dropped a
   few degrees what probably indicates the queen is laying much less eggs
   and the bees are preparing for a long cold period.

   Ambient temperature (outside beehive, shade) vs. cluster temperature
   (inside beehive)

   Weight graph

   A couple of days before the beginning of this graph, the bees were
   given extra sugar water (the two steep drops in the graph are the
   removal of the empty sugar water reservoirs).

   Due to the bad weather the bees don’t fly much and certainly don’t
   bring much food in. The weight drops because of the erratic weather,
   the number of bees is also reducing because they prepare for winter.
   The weight rises and decreases slightly within one day but the overall
   weight is decreasing.

   The weight is displayed in grams, because of the half-scale design this
   is only the weight of half the hive. To know the total weight, it has
   to be multiplied by two. A future software upgrade will display the
   real weight.

   Beehive weight in grams

   Future plans

   A revision/upgrade of the BeeMonitor is in development. Below the key
   features of the first version with the most important upgrades in the
   new version.

   Key features
     * Atmega328p microcontroller (Arduino compatible)
     * 2 internal AAA batteries (3V)
     * Powerdown: 35 nA
     * Wakeup every 15′, 30′, 1h or 2h selected with internal dipswitch
     * Beehive ID selected with internal dipswitch (up to 15 hives without
       re-programming)
     * Low power 868 MHz radio with internal antenna (up to ± 250m),
       external antenna possible
     * Manual “wakeup” button
     * RGB led
     * Buzzer
     * Internal ambient temperature/humidity sensor
     * 2 RJ12 ports for external temperature/humidity beehive sensors

   Upgrades
     * New, slightly larger housing
     * 3 RJ12 ports for temperature/humidity beehive sensors
     * Internal (removable) HX711 ADC module
     * Separate (pluggable) connector for beehive load-cell scale
     * Extra “calibrate button” for easy scale calibration
     * Even lower power consumption
     * Integrated boost converter to operate down to 1,8V

   The current gateway is based on a Raspberry Pi, running open-source
   “Domoticz” software. This is actually home-automation software, because
   I had this running for other projects I chose to implement the
   BeeMonitor in Domoticz for the prototype.

   Because this is not really a plug & play option for beehives, a new
   cheaper Wi-Fi, IoT (LoRaWAN) gateway needs to be developed to forward
   all data to an online platform. Analyzing all available
   options, Hiveeyes.org seems the best option.

The “BeeMonitor” project

   Beekeeping is a time consuming hobby, it’s not so easy as it sounds.
   Making sure the bees are healthy takes a lot of knowledge and
   experience.

   Adding sensors to a beehive helps the beekeeper to monitor the hive and
   take action when things are not as expected.

   Therefor I decided to make my own “BeeMonitor”. Starting with the
   electronics, connecting our hives to the internet!

     The BeeMonitor with sensors

   The technical side:

   The BeeMonitor is a “battery powered wireless datalogger”. It’s a
   compact controller with user-changeable dipswitches, RGB led, buzzer,
   “plug & play” RJ12 connectors designed for different sensors
   combinations and is capable to carry 2 different wireless modules, a
   RFM69W for use in a private network or the RFM95W to connect to an
   LPWAN IoT network (LoRaWAN) on sub-gigahertz radio bands. Powered by 2
   AAA battery’s, operating on 3V the”BeeMonitor” only consumes 35nA in
   sleep the making the battery’s last for years! Great, isn’t it?

   Transmitted messages are received by a gateway, processed and stored in
   a database. Data can be shown on a website and even in online “live”
   graphs depending on the needs.

   BeeMonitor with custom front

   For example, some temperature & humidity data from one of our beehives:

   Battery life:

   The prototype has been up & running, collecting data for about 2 months
   now. So far the battery voltage has dropped from 3.17V to 3.12V without
   any (low power) software optimisation. Even without the battery will
   keep the BeeMonitor up & running for a very long time, all the way down
   to 1.9V. That’s when the voltage reaches the minimum operation voltage
   for some of the hardware.

   Power consumption:

   Measuring one wake-up cycle (about 2 seconds) gives a clear overview of
   the power consumption of the hardware. A short description of how
   things work here (reference: 1 mV = 1 mA):
     * 0 s: External input, interrupt or timer waking up a part of the
       hardware (50 nA)
     * 250 ms: Power enabled to other hardware (1.8 mA)
     * 320 ms: Microcontroller startup, bootloader (3.5 mA)
     * 1.7 s: Microcontroller running program, reading sensors, processing
     * 1.82 s: Sending message (50 mA)
     * 1.83 s: Waiting for ACK from gateway (18 mA)
     * 1.85 s: Blink green led (4 mA)
     * 2 s: Powerdown (35 nA)

   This graph makes clear I need to optimize the bootloader, because it
   takes 1.38 s! Thats way to long for battery powered hardware.

   Future plans:

   There are some improvements needed such as an optimized bootloader,
   optimized software for better battery life, ..

   September 2017: The prototype has been upgraded, read more about the
   plans & upgrades here.

LoRaWAN Node with onboard antenna

   After the great succes with the default LoRaWAN Node I really wanted to
   design an inexpensive Node with an build-in antenna for small LoRaWAN
   use cases.

   side_picture_export

   Good antenna’s are expensive!

   When it comes to antenna’s, one thing is certain: Good antenna’s aren’t
   cheap.
   I guess we all bought those crappy cheap antennas in the past to find
   out they are not designed for that frequency or don’t work at all..

   Choosing for an onboard antenna makes you node compact an even more low
   cost. You don’t need those antenna connectors, cables and antennas. Any
   PCB based antenna won’t have the same range as an “real” antenna but
   the goal is to get about half the distance.

   The new antenna: Ceramic chip or custom antenna design?

   For an onboard antenna you can easily chose an ceramic chip antenna for
   the desired frequency. There are a lot of these antenna chips available
   and it doesn’t take a lot of experience to use them. They can save you
   most space on your PCB.

   Ceramic chip antennas

   Most of these chips are affordable but I decided to not use any chip
   antenna and design my own antenna!
   Making the ideal antenna takes some time and a certain knowledge in
   electronics, HF and antenna’s. This includes everything from
   calculations, simulations, designing, prototyping, measuring, and
   modifying before the results are really satisfying.

   The design

   For the new Node I didn’t want to change anything from my existing
   proven “TvB LoRaWAN Node”. This limits the available space to a width
   of 26mm for the antenna.

   Here’s the initial design I came up with:

   pcb-design

   Verifying, measuring, optimizing and testing the antenna design took a
   while but the result was worth it.
   The final measurements concluded that the center frequency of the
   antenna design is about 20 MHz’s off the 868 MHz goal. So we’re not
   there yet.

   That’s great, but what does that mean?

   An design update, mostly based on measurements.
   The most important thing of any antenna is the range. To get the
   maximum out of your antenna the center frequency has to match the
   desired frequency as best possible. This point will transmit the most
   RF energy resulting in a better range.

   You can’t compare a lab measurement with an real world test so you
   always have to verify the range. After assembling the first prototype
   it’s time to put it to the test!

   top_view_battery_export

   For range testing I simply hooked up an GPS module to the battery
   powered Node.
   The Node receives a GPS location form the GPS module and transmits it’s
   location every 15 seconds over LoRaWAN.

   When a message is received on the gateway(‘s) you can simply plot the
   distance between transmitter and receiver.
   For testing purposes I used an RFM95W LoRa module from HopeRF, with the
   default LoRaWAN settings (SF12). That’s it!

   The range, what can you expect from internal, microstrip antenna’s?

   I didn’t expect much from a small antenna but I guess I’m wrong.
   LoRaWAN is a very impressive technology that’s able to send messages
   over many and many km’s.

   Practical measurements with a regular node (default λ/4 antenna for 868
   MHz) results in maximum ranges up to 20km and more in the ideal
   situation.
   I guessed the range of the internal antenna would be around a couple of
   km’s with a maximum range of 5 km’s. Everything beyond that would be
   great.

   Range test, the first test-drive

   I didn’t expect much from the first range test-drive. In the message
   log I was hoping to find a couple of messages but there much more
   received messages than “just a couple”. Meaning only one thing: The
   Node works!

   Analyzing all location data showed distances up to a whopping 9 km from
   inside the car!
   All other range measurements confirmed this first impression.

   Conclusion

   I may decide that this node has a guaranteed range of about 5 km for
   LoRaWAN use cases in real world. Almost all messages within that radius
   are well received on the gateways.

   The test data also showed that the antenna acts as a directional
   antenna, performing a little bit better in the one direction than the
   other. Unlike an default λ/4 antenna that radiates the same amount of
   energy in all directions.
   The node has to be used with the antenna pointing upwards for the best
   results.

   Hardware details

   top_bottom_combined

   Work in progress

   There’s still some space for improvement. Because the used frequency in
   Europe is 868MHz I’ve optimized the design for that exact frequency.
   Based on the measurements on the first design I made a couple of
   different modified versions. The good news: some of them perform better
   than the first version because they have more gain on 868MHz.

   The LoRaWAN Node is only 7.5 mm thick when used with an RN2483 LoRaWAN
   module (without JST battery connector).

   Pinout:

   tvb-lorawan-node-rev-2-pinout
   Because I like to use different LoRaWAN modules depending on the
   project I’ve added support for the 2 most popular LoRaWAN modules:
     * TvB LoRaWAN Node – RFM95W
     * TvB LoRaWAN Node – RN2483 (LoRaWAN Certified)

   Without any hardware modifications I can use one of these 2 modules.
   The practical range of both modules is the same, the only big
   difference is the missing LoRAWAN certification for the RFM95W.


   Here a more detailed picture of the Node with headers, SMA antenna
   connector and the JST battery connector to power the board (the power
   cable is not included).

   TvB LoRaWAN Node with accessories

   To make my applications more “Plug & Play” I made myself a great
   gadget: The “Proto Shield”.
   It’s designed to fit on the node to create prototyping space.
   It even has an extra mosfet load-switch circuit with LED indication to
   power ON/OFF external circuits! Great, isn’t it?

The new LoRaWAN Node is alive!


   Last week I found some time to assemble and test my new LoRaWAN Node
   and here’s the result.

   TvB LoRaWAN Node - Front view Features of the new board:
     * Only 25 mm x 40 mm!
     * Low power Atmega1284p microcontroller (Arduino compatible, incl.
       bootloader & library)
     * Standard JST battery connector
     * Onboard single cell li-ion / polymer battery charger with charge
       status LED (charging from USB programmer or solar panel)
     * Onboard 3.3V LDO regulator with protection circuit
     * Battery voltage measurement
     * Breadboard compatible headers
     * Reset button
     * RGB led
     * Extra blue led for RX/TX activity (default color, can be changed on
       request)
     * Full FTDI programming header
     * U.FL & SMA antenna connectors
     * LoRaWAN:
          + Support for Microchip RN2483 & RN2903 LoRaWAN modules
          + Support for HopeRF RFM9X LoRa modules

   The best part of this module is that the LoRaWAN module can be chosen.
   I’ve added support for both modules on the same board!
   TvB LoRaWAN Node - Back view

   This Node is a perfect starting base for most of my LoRaWAN projects.
   It’s the same size as the recent Sodaq LoRaONE and a whole lot cheaper!
   (But there’s no fancy GPS or accelerometer).

New “TvB LoRaWAN Node” in development

   After the succes with the first versions of the “TvB Wireless Node’s” I
   decided to develop a new, upgraded LoRaWAN node.

   This new node will support 2 different LoRaWAN modules:
     * Microchip RN2483 LoRaWAN module
     * HopeRF RFM9X LoRaWAN module

   This means the node can be fitted with an RFM95 or an RN2483, whatever
   fits you best.

   Here’s a sneak peek of the new node!

   TvB LoRaWAN Node

   The node is about te same size as the SODAQ LoRaONE and doesn’t have a
   build in GPS or accelerometer.
   When comparing the price tag there’s a huge difference!. Most project’s
   don’t need fancy extra’s. They only need a compact, powerful and multi
   purpose LoRaWAN node. So here’s my solution that fits all my use cases.

   Changes from the previous version:
     * Combined RFM9X and RN2483 design on back-side
     * Added voltage protection circuit
     * Added battery charger circuit with charging LED for lithium ion
       battery’s
     * Added a small RGB-led
     * Changed the programming header to a fully compatible 6-pin FTDI
       connector.

LoRaWAN IoT Node


   Past few month’s I’ve been researching and testing with LoRaWAN
   networks.
   After some good test results I decided to developed my own compact,
   fully Arduino compatible LoRaWAN Node and also develop use cases with
   them. When developing this hardware it was almost impossible to buy the
   RN2483 LoRaWAN modules from Microchip. That’s why I chose for RFM95W
   LoRa modules from HopeRF. Not a bad choice after all, the hardware is
   very impressive!

   The “TvB Wireless Node”, not just another LoRaWAN node:

   Oh wait, when I said “tiny”, just compare the node with the SODAQ Mbili
   development board for LoRaWAN. It’s just a little bigger than
   Microchip’s RN2483 LoRaWAN module.

   Easy prototyping

   A LoRaWAN node is nothing without easy prototyping options. This one is
   breadboard and prototype PCB compatible! All main data lines are
   available with enough digital I/O’s and ADC pins. All you need!

   Or just directly connect a battery for your mobile application. All
   types of battery’s can be used with a maximum input of 6V DC. The LDO
   voltage regulator guarantees a stable 3,3V power supply, even for
   voltages as low as 3,45V! This makes the use of single cell li-ion
   battery’s ideal without damaging the transceiver.

Affordable PoE? DIY

   PoE (Power Over Ethernet) enabled switches costs a lot of money, so I
   decided to make my own. After some research i found out how PoE works,
   and it’s fairly easy to modify an existing Fast Ethernet 10/100 Mbit/s
   switch.

   Here is how Ethernet cable / UTP cable is wired:

   PoE 802.3 af

   PoE is based on the 2 wire pairs who are not used in 10/100 Mbit/s
   networks, 1 pair + 48V DC and 1 pair Ground. ( 1 pair = 2 wires)

   My modification to the switch is similar to “Passive PoE” injectors.
   it’s based on “PoE 802.3 af” and it injects 48V DC but without the auto
   sense protocol to check if the connected device is PoE capable. This
   can cause permanent damage if you plug in other devices in the modified
   switch who are not PoE capable. In other words, it’s a dumb PoE switch.

   Note: Do not try this with Gigabit switches because these use all 4
   data pairs instead of only 2 pairs for 10/100 networks!
   Note: Use only straight cables, no cross over cables. These can damage
   the connected device.

   All components i needed for this mod:

   – 10/100 Mbit/s switch (5 port switch i had laying around)
   – electronics wire 0,2 mm²
   – External 48V DC power supply
   – Fuse holder with fuse (20 mm glas fuse, 0.75 A)
   – 5.5mm/2.1mm DC plug
   – LED with resistor (power ON indicator)
   – Diode 1N4007 (polarity safety)
   – Glue gun & glue sticks

   Here is the result of  the switch:

   PoE Switch

   On the back the 48V DC input with green power ON led:

   PoE Switch

   The connections to the Ethernet cables:

   PoE Switch

   The + 48 VDC is connected to pins 4 & 5 and ground (-) to pins 7 & 8 of
   the 4 outgoing PoE ports, the incoming LAN port is unmodified. The 20
   mm glass fuse is a regular blow 0.75 A. Just in case something goes
   wrong.

   All switches have resistors connected to ground on unused wires to
   avoid interference, in my case each unused wire was connected with a
   75Ω resistor to ground. If these resistors are not removed, the 48V
   input would flow through the resistor to ground. And there are 8
   resistors in total for 4 ethernet ports.

   Not a good idea to leave those resistors there, 1 resistor will have a
   current of 48V/75Ω = 0,64 A !

   This is how to prevent this: just break the PCB traces!

   Original:

   Before

   After:

   After

   I use this switch to power PoE capable IP camera’s (CCTV) with solid
   100% bare copper UTP cable.

   Note: Do not use CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum) UTP cables, these are not
   suitable for conducting currents (too high resistance) and can cause
   high power loss in the cables. Remember why they removed all aluminium
   conductors from residents?? Because the cables were overheating and
   causing fire.

Upgraded version of the Arduino Roller Shutters / Roller Blinds Controller

   It took a while to get all the components for the final version, found
   a little free time to etch the PCB, solder everything together, test
   the final version and shoot some pictures but it’s worth the result!

   (Note: the on screen display language is Dutch)

   2015-04-16 11.50.25

   Final result of the controller

   The controller is a mobile battery powered device, it can be placed
   everywhere! No longer dependent from power-consuming power
   adapters!!!!!

   Battery value is measured automatic and gives an indication when to
   recharge the controller. The operating periode is about 2 to 3 weeks
   with two re-used 6 years old lithium ion 18650 batteries from an old
   laptop battery pack. The remaining capacity is not much but good enough
   for this application.

   The OLED display consumes the most power. OLED stands for organic LED,
   this means the display continuously emits light and is easy to read in
   the dark. The “most” power is a couple of mA’s but this is a lot
   against some other LCD displays (some µA’s).

   The Arduino runs on a 8Mhz clock, with the necessary power saving
   functions it runs on a couple of hundreds µA (Note: the red power led
   on the Arduino Pro Mini is removed!), with the OLED display (and all
   the remaining electronics are negligible) it’s only mA’s of power
   consumption in total.
   That’s battery friendly i guess 🙂

   The overall operating voltage has to be between 2,7V and 5,5V for
   correct functionality. (battery protection auto. shutdown voltage at
   2,5V)

   Some features of the controller:

   2015-04-16 11.48.07

   Time schedule of 5 shutters (open/close)

   2015-04-16 11.47.38

   Option to choose between stored time or light sensor based (with adjust
   value: lighter/darker) closing of the rolling shutters

   2015-04-16 11.47.22

   Example: setting and storing time open/close for Rolling Shutter 1

   2015-04-16 11.46.34

   Setting and storing the day, month and year

   The controller has a menu to adjust, change and store:

   – time (hours: 0 to 23, minutes: 0 to 59)
   – day (1 to 31)
   – month (1 to 12)
   – year (2015 to 2099)
   – day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on)
   – random range in minutes (when time is set to 8:00 and random range is
   10 minutes: the shutters will open between 7:55 and 8:05)
   – light measurement adjustment (threshold “dark” value for light
   sensor)
   – all roller shutters have there own open/close hour (accuracy is 1
   minute, for instance 8:16)
   – enable/disable channels (for instance if you have a door, you can
   disable that channel so you can still re-enter. That would not be
   possible if the shutter was closed!!!)
   – automatic/timed shutter closing (the option can be “Time” of “Light”,
   Time means stored time and Light means sensor based)

   Note: the time, day, year, .. are kept by the DS3231 Real Time Clock IC
   and when powerless, powered by the 3V coin cell (= memory function)
   Note: other parameters are stored permanently in the Arduino’s EEPROM

   The printed circuit board in detail:

   The PCB is made in 2 stackable boards, the bottom module is the Arduino
   Pro Mini 3,3V controller with a LiPo Fuel Gauge from Sparkfun, Lithium
   ion battery charger module with battery protection for charging
   and discharging (with shutdown when the voltage drops below 2,5V for no
   battery damage), a ON/OFF master slide switch, reset button and battery
   connector terminal.

   To recharge the module, simply plug in a micro USB cable. The charger
   board has 2 on board indication leds: RED: charging and BLUE: charged.

   2015-04-16 11.44.12

   Bottom module

   The top module has al the features for time keeping (DS3231 IC in the
   middle of the board), light measurement, switching capabilities, 5
   input tactile push buttons for navigation in menu & settings and the
   OLED connector for the 1,3″ OLED display. At the top of the module is
   the connector for the Niko Easywave remote control.

   2015-04-16 11.40.41

   Top module (picture without OLED display)

   Side view
   The side view of the controller, the headers are default 2,54mm
   headers. The male headers are 17mm long in stead of the 10mm
   usual. (because the 3V coin cell backup battery for the RTC on the
   bottom of the top module)

   Following pictures are the bare PCB’s

   2015-03-18 13.39.19 2015-03-18 13.39.41

   That’s a short overview of the controller, more detailed information
   about the working and components can be found in the previous post of
   the “prototype” of the controller.

Arduino Roller Shutters / Roller Blinds Controller

   The Arduino Roller Shutters Controller is an Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V
   based device to automate the roller shutters / roller blinds.

   My current setup for the control of the roller shutters / roller
   blinds is a Niko Easywave system with multi channel 868,3 MHz remote
   control and built-in wall receivers. This remote controller has only
   buttons and no possibility to set a time for automated functions.
   Unfortunate in the Niko Easywave series there is no affordable
   alternative for automatisation so I decided to make my own custom
   Arduino home automation system. Here is an overview of my controller:

   Niko Easywave Prototype Final

   The home made controller

   Pro Mini

   Arduino Pro Mini used for the controller

   Rolling shutters Rolling shutters (picture only for demo)

   Niko materials:
   Niko Easywave build-in receiver for shutter control: product 05-333
   Niko Easywave remote controller with 4 channels and 13 buttons: product
   05-312

   Niko 05-333 Receiver       Niko 05-312 Remote      2015-02-26 13.32.43
   aangepast

   For more information about the Niko products: http://www.niko.eu

   The research, 868.3 MHz is a no-go:
   The radio frequency is 868.3 MHz, not a very often-used  radio
   frequency.
   The best solution would be to generate codes on this frequency in
   combination with a transmitter for the Arduino. But I was unable to
   successfully copy the transmitted codes or generate compatible codes.
   The receivers are self-learning so I also tried to learn them my codes
   but this didn’t work ether. So the used protocol stays a mystery.

   Arduino “push a button”:
   After that I decided to design a circuit so the Arduino can “push a
   button” on the remote.

   With a direct digital output/input from the Arduino you can bypass a
   real switch, witch in reality equals a “push” on a button. In my case
   iI wanted to keep the 2 systems completely separate. In this way I
   can’t damage the original remote with any external voltages.

   After some measurements and research on the PCB of the remote I
   connected wires directly to the buttons and brought them out with a pin
   female header connector so I can easily disconnect the remote when
   necessary.

   The “push” circuit is very simple and based on optocouplers I had
   laying around, the circuits are separated with an optical coupling. An
   optocoupler is a LED and photodiode in the same package. When current
   flows through the LED, the resistance of the photodiode decreases. This
   means no VCC of GND signal is connected. This also means the original
   battery has to remain in the remote to power itself.

   Optocoupler diagram

   Outputs required for controlling the remote:
   On the remote there are in total 12 buttons who need to be “pushed”, so
   12 optocouplers and 12 digital outputs are required. On a regular
   Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V there are not a lot pins. Well, this may be a
   problem considering what’s used in this project:
   The Atmel ATmega328P has only 32 pins with 22 I/O pins configurable.
   In reality these are not all digital outputs, some are analog input
   only like pin A6 & A7 and cannot be used as output.
   Pin D0 & D1 are the TXO en TXI programming lines and should be left
   alone if possible.
   Finally there are the data lines: I2C (A4 & A5) [Needed for RTC]
   and SPI (D9, D10, D11 and D12 mostly) [Needed for OLED display]

   This means I have 12 outputs and 2 analog inputs left for general
   purpose.
   Good luck I only needed 12 outputs! These were all used for controlling
   the remote.

   This also means I have 2 analog inputs left at the moment.

   Time keeping made easy:
   A feature of the controller is the function to keep track of the
   current time without loosing it when powered down. To solve this I used
   a RTC (Real Time Clock) DS3231 module. This module does al the time
   keeping including date and year. All I need to do is process and manage
   the time. When the module starts up it reads the current time stored in
   the module, from that moment the Arduino works interrupt based by
   counting the hour, minutes and seconds passed. To keep the time correct
   the Arduino synchronizes once a day with the RTC to get the exact time
   because the time shifts a couple of seconds a day.
   The module is connected on the I2C data line (SDA/SCL) and has a 3V
   cell as backup voltage to remember the real time.

   DS3231 RTC

   The DS3231 Module

   A small OLED display:
   A standalone device without any way to display information is not very
   handy. That’s the reason i chose to add a small 1.3″ SPI OLED graphics
   display. The display has 128×64 pixels and can be used for graphics,
   not only text. It uses SPI to communicate with the Arduino on 4
   general-purpose  I/O pins. I chose the default software SPI pins: 9
   (MOSI), 10 (CLK), 11 (DC), 12 (CS).

   Niko Easywave Prototype Screen

   What about controls for the display?
   Because I only have 2 analog inputs left and I need more than 2 buttons
   to use the controller I was forced to use a resistor network in
   combination with tactile switches to detect any inputs. I chose for
   5 tactile switches, this is the most users friendly for this
   application.
   The buttons are read by ADC (Analog to Digital conversion) and
   processed in the Arduino to decide which button was pushed.

   Tact Switch

   Extra feature: Photodiode for light measurement!
   After a while I came up with the idea of using a photodiode to measure
   the light intensity. This “sensor” looks like a ordinary 5mm LED
   (located next to the OLED display), is also read by ADC and is
   connected to the very last available pin on my Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V.
   The Arduino processes the value and now can be used for an automatic
   light intensity closing.

   A short specs overview:
   – Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V (8MHz)
   – 1.3″ SPI OLED display (128×64 pixels)
   – RTC DS3231 Module
   – 5 inputs switches
   – 12 outputs
   – 12 optocouplers
   – Photodiode

   Total expenses:
   Less than 15 euro everything together. This is really cheap compared to
   those expensive home automation controllers. Off course there are a lot
   of hours researching, developing and testing witch you don’t have when
   you buy a system.

   The big advantage of building your own controller is that I can do
   anything I want, that’s not possible with bought stuff.

   And this is the result:
   The device is still a prototype and made on pieces of stacked
   breadboard. In the future the device is getting it’s own PCB with
   Lithium-ion battery power supply. That’s off course the main reason the
   3.3V Arduino Pro Mini was used.

   Niko Easywave Prototype Final  Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V (8Mhz), RTC module
   DS 3231 and OLED display with 5 buttons.

   Niko Easywave Prototype Final

   Remote connected to the controller

    And this is how the remote is modified inside:

   Niko Easywave Remote inside

   Power consumption:

   At the moment the controller can operate between maximum 5.5V and will
   still work to a minimum of 2.8V to 2.7V. This is ideal to use with a
   Lithium-ion battery.
   On 5V the measured current is 15-20 mA
   On 3V the measured current is 10-12 mA

   For example, on a single 18650 3,7V Lithium-ion 2600 mAh cell the
   controller should work between 5 and 10 days in theory.

   Note: with a optimized Arduino code you can get even better battery
   life. (I did nothing in the Arduino code to save any power)

   Software:
   I’m not planning to post the code. But questions are welcome.

   Prototype in action!
   Video coming later!

DIY Mengpaneel

   Like on Facebook

   Op mijn planning stond dat ik een klein mengpaneeltje wil maken voor
   audio, na enige verdieping is dit ‘kleine’ mengpaneel veranderd in
   een professionele zelfgemaakte DJ mixer met uitgebreide functies van
   hoge kwaliteit.

   Hier zijn een aantal voorlopige specificaties:

   – Minimaal 3 Stereo mix kanalen (+ andere functies, staan nog niet
   allemaal in een schema)
   – Tone control (Hi, Mid, Low) per mixkanaal
   – Volume per mixkanaal regelbaar
   – Balance per mixkanaal regelbaar
   – Crossfader tussen A en B
   – Stereo out master volume met VU meters
   – Headphone out (cue functie)

   Andere voorziene aansluitingen zijn:

   – 3x Line in Stereo
   – Mic input (optioneel)
   – Mini-jack Stereo input (handig voor kleine toestellen zoals MP3 enz.)


   Dus dit is niet zomaar een kleine mixer, er komt veel passive en active
   elektronica bij kijken. De kostprijs zal onderdrukt blijven omdat alles
   zelfbouw is. Het resultaat zal een gepersonaliseerd mengpaneel zijn van
   hoge kwaliteit.

   Preview van hoe het zou moeten zijn (toch zo is het in het echt)
   Zo’n resultaat zou perfect zijn, we gaan proberen!

Smit Nederland

   Mijn deeltijdse hobby is ook modelbouw, ik ben graag bezig met
   elektronica. Daarom heb ik in mijn RC Boot zelf mijn elektronica
   ontworpen en gemaakt.

   Een aantal modules die ingebouwd zijn in de Smit Nederland zijn:
   – Digitale snelheidsregelaars (met PIC
   microcontroller, zelflerende nulpunt en maximum snelheid en achteruit)
   – 2 kanaals schakeldecoder met vermogenrelais (met PIC microcontroller,
   met- en zonder geheugen functie)
   – 12 kanaals Encoder en Decoder (met PIC
   microcontroller, multiplexer voor 1 kanaal 12 functies,  met- en zonder
   geheugen functie)
   – Dieselgeluidgenerator (met instelbaar geluid en snelheid gestuurd)
   – 12V naar 5V voeding, geen batterijen nodig voor de ontvanger

   Voor de rest heeft de boot ook nog verlichting, boegschroef, sleeplier,
   ankers,..

   De motoren zijn 2x 12V Decaperms. De batterij is een 12V loodaccu van
   7Ah.


   Hieronder enkele foto’s van de boot, Smit Nederland:

Filmpje van de robot in werking

   In de loop van deze week heb ik de beide printplaten voor de bumper
   modules gemaakt en gemonteerd op de robot. Ik heb er een filmpje van
   gemaakt met de robot in werking met de bumpers erop gemonteerd. In het
   filmpje bestuur ik de robot met de computer en schakel ik de
   verlichting ook aan en uit op afstand met de computer via de Bluetooth
   verbinding met de robot.

   Het eerste filmpje van de robot:

Microcontroller module PIC18F4550 met LCD scherm

   Ik heb de module die ik eerder gebruikt heb op het prototype van de
   Robot aangepast zodat er een LCD scherm op past. Op vraag van de
   leerkracht en naar de toekomstige jaren toe zullen we dit bordje gaan
   gebruiken in de lessen. Het is volledig universeel en daarom ideaal
   voor de leerlingen. De functies zijn volledig dezelfde als het bordje
   van begin dit schooljaar, enkel is het LCD scherm toegevoegd om het
   gemakkelijker te maken om te gebruiken. De modules vervangen de
   ‘Dwengo’ bordjes op school en zijn goedkoop te maken en daarom ideaal
   voor de leerlingen.

   Verder ligt dit bordje ideaal in de hand en is het zeer compact,
   volledig van functionaliteit en zeer gebruiksvriendelijk.

Bumper modules voor de Robot

   Ik heb deze week de Bumper modules afgewerkt. De bumpers zijn de
   voorbumper en de achterbumper van de robot.

   Hierop zitten de schakelaars voor de noodstop en een aantal Leds. De
   Leds hebben functies zoals de dimlichten; voorlichten en achterlichten,
   grootlichten en pinkers van een echte auto. Onderaan de voorbumper is
   een extra sensormodule voordien met 4 optische sensoren die kleuren
   kunnen detecteren. Hiermee kan onderscheid gemaakt worden tussen wit,
   zwart en alle andere kleuren. Ook is deze module capabel om de rand van
   een tafel te detecteren zodat de robot niet van een tafel kan rijden.

Hoofdmodule Bleutooth Robot

   In deze post ga ik het kort hebben over de Hoofdmodule van de volledige
   robot.

   Op deze module zitten alle functies in 1 module, dit wil zeggen dat
   deze module alle onderdelen bevat die nodig zijn voor de volledige
   robot. Op deze module zit een LCD scherm, motor sturing, LED sturing,
   5V regelaar, USB, programmer en nog andere functies die de robot slim
   maken zoals een lichtmeting en spanningsmetingen voor de interne
   batterijen. Op deze module kan een een batterij aangesloten worden, als
   de externe adapter verwijderd is zal de robot direct overschakelen op
   de batterijen. Zonder onderbreking en spanningsverlies. Er zijn 2
   schakelaars voorzien; één schakelaar voor de robot aan en uit te zetten
   en één voor de keuze van de spanning voor de motoren.

   De module is voorzien met de nodige aansluitingen voor bumpers, waarop
   led’s, schakelaars voor mechanische beveiliging en optische sensoren
   komen om kleurverschillen op de grond te kunnen volgen.

   Hoofdmodule met programmer, USB en voeding aangesloten

    Deze module is getest en werkt. Later komen de beide bumpers en de
   sensormodule (module waarop de optische sensoren gemonteerd zijn die
   vlak boven de grond aan de onderkant van de voorste module geplaatst
   worden)
