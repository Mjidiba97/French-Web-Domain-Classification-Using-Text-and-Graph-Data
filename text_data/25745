Oculus Quest Will Support Oculus Go Apps Later This Year

   Later this year Oculus Quest is going to get access to a heap of new VR
   content thanks to support for Oculus Go apps via official emulation.

   Oculus CTO John Carmack this week confirmed that Oculus Quest will
   eventually support Oculus Go apps ‚Äúby way of a compatibility layer that
   makes Quest report as a Go and emulate the Go controller for old apps.‚Äù
   The feature will be added sometime later this year, and will
   potentially bring hundreds of new apps to Oculus Quest.

   It isn‚Äôt clear if the entire library of Oculus Go content will be
   unleashed on Quest out of the gate; a likely scenario would be that
   that Oculus asks developers of Go apps to opt-in to allow their Go app
   to run on Quest.

   ‚ÄúWe will be working with developers to test against the emulator, but I
   hope some will be inspired enough to convert older apps to proper
   ‚Äòhybrid‚Äô Go / Quest apps with explicit support,‚Äù said Carmack.

   While Go apps aren‚Äôt built to support Quest‚Äôs 6DOF head and controller
   tracking, Carmack says that, for many apps, the emulation brings full
   tracking and then some.

   ‚ÄúNot everything works, but many old apps do magically get 6DOF headset
   and controller tracking, as well as higher resolution and frame rate,
   so it is fun to dig through some old favorites,‚Äù he said.
   Image courtesy Oculus

   The move seems at odds with Oculus‚Äô decision to be more strict about
   the quality of apps it will allow on Quest compared to its other
   headsets.

   ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve set a high bar for content quality on Quest, higher than we‚Äôve
   ever enforced before, in order to build a platform where everyone has
   confidence in the quality of the titles they‚Äôre buying and developers
   know that their investments have a strong chance of success,‚Äù the
   company said about the decision back in February.

   Indeed, Oculus Quest has a far smaller library of apps available today
   than Oculus Go, but the selection is choice compared to many smaller
   scope and generally less polished apps in the Go library. And while
   there‚Äôs certainly some gems on Go, allowing Quest to run Go apps‚Äîwhich
   weren‚Äôt even designed for the headset in the first place‚Äîseems like it
   could become a trojan horse for getting apps onto Quest which otherwise
   wouldn‚Äôt meet Oculus‚Äô more stringent quality standards. We‚Äôve reached
   out to the company to understand how they‚Äôll approach this.

       Rebuild the Hybrid is only good way‚Ä¶emulation Sucks at all 4s.
     * Mateusz Pawluczuk
       Finally some common sense. There‚Äôs just so much media oriented
       content on the Go whether it‚Äôs animation, interactive stories,
       meditation apps, various VR180 stuff (even Rodriguez‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Limit‚Äù
       with it‚Äôs mixed reviews is still a kind of milestone).

       One thing Quest is missing is iPhone (or whatever smart phone)
       screen mirroring. Big Screen Beta is sweet for casting from the
       computer but for portability casting from a cell would be deadly.
     * TonyVT SkarredGhost
       Nice idea‚Ä¶ I think we needed this. The problem is that Go has not
       the same content curation of Quest and so I wonder how they will
       manage this

   <p>Both headsets are said to include between 10-15% better panel
   utilization over its predecessor and the same 170-degree horizontal

   upcoming PC tethering feature coming to Quest headsets in November.
   Oculus Link, as it&#8217;s called, will let users plug into VR ready
   PCs and play games originally designed for Rift. Oculus is calling it
   &#8220;the best of both worlds,&#8221; but then where does that leave
   their latest PC VR headset, Rift S?</p> <p><span
   id="more-90856"></span></p> <p>Quest and Rift S, Oculus&#8217; newest
   headsets, launched just six months ago, but it wasn&#8217;t until today
   that Oculus announced a PC tethering featureîsomething which customers
   had been asking about well before the launch of the headsets.</p>
   <p>For many contemplating picking up one of the two headsets, the
   fundamental equation boiled down to this:</p> <ul> <li>Rift S: Costs
   $400;†plays high-end games connected to PC</li> <li>Quest: Costs $400;
   plays low-end games with no PC</li> </ul> <p>If you wanted the high-end
   experience, you&#8217;d clearly pick the Rift S. If you wanted
   portability and convenience, you&#8217;d pick Quest.</p> <p>But
   today&#8217;s announcement, as near as we can tell, completely changes
   that equation.</p> <ul> <li>Rift S: Costs $400; plays high-end games
   connected to PC</li> <li>Quest: Costs $400;†plays low-end games with no
   PC†<em>and</em>†plays high-end games connected to PC</li> </ul> <p>So why
   would anyone buy a Rift S for the same price as Quest when the latter
   effectively has twice the functionality? Yes, there&#8217;s some
   technical differences between the headsetsîthe display tech is a bit
   different and so are the ergonomicsîbut hardly enough to be
   consequential in the face of mobile + PC functionality vs. PC-only
   functionality.</p> <p>In fact, with Oculus Link, Oculus is calling
   Quest &#8220;the best of both worlds.&#8221; So&#8230; would you like
   &#8216;the best of both worlds for&#8217; $400, or &#8216;not the best
   of both worlds&#8217; for $400. The choice appears so obvious that the
   question itself seems an affront to your intelligence.</p> <p>Granted,
   Oculus Link won&#8217;t come until November, and there&#8217;s still
   some unanswered questions about exactly how it will work, which could
   make things a little less clear-cut. But at present, our understanding
   is that Oculus Link will turn question into a full-fledged PC VR
   headset. Oculus has confirmed to <em>Road to VR</em>†that Quest will not
   just be able to play the entire Rift library, it&#8217;ll be able to
   use all the same platform functionality that Rift uses, like Dash,
   Oculus Home, etc.</p> <p>For the record, I think that Oculus is making
   the right choice for the future by making Oculus Link and Quest PC
   tethering a reality. That said, there&#8217;s no denying that
   it&#8217;s creating an awkward moment for its customersîmany of whom had
   been suggesting all along that Quest should logically connect to PCs to
   no avail and then being shunted to buying a Rift S when Quest
   didn&#8217;t get have it at launch.</p> <p>If Oculus Link really does
   turn Quest into a full featured PC VR headset, then who the hell is
   Rift S for?</p> <p>Rift S already seemed like an awkward sibling rather
   than a proper sequel to the original Rift. Because many of the changes
   from Rift to Rift S felt like side-steps (or maybe even like
   downgrades) the Rift S wasn&#8217;t exactly an obvious upgrade for
   existing Rift owners.</p> <div class="rtovrintelly" style="clear:both;

   Choice for VR Newcomers, a Difficult Choice for VR
   Vets</div></div></div></div></a></div> <p>The only reasonable strategy
   for Oculus from here may follow this line of thought: slash the price
   of the Rift S down to $300 or even $200, thereby turning it into the
   unassailable recommendation for anyone looking to take their first step
   into PC VR. And while they&#8217;re at it, Oculus might want to think
   of a way to compensate their loyal and enthusiastic early adopter
   customers who may have begrudgingly chose Rift S over Quest so that
   they could stay in the PC VR ecosystem, only to watch the other headset
   subsume that functionality a few months later.</p> <p>So far, Oculus
   hasn&#8217;t said anything about plans to change pricing or strategy.
   The company tells†<em>Road to VR</em> that it will continue to sell the
   Rift S, and that it is still positioning the headset as &#8220;the gold
   standard for performance, graphics and the most immersive VR
   gameplay,&#8221; but without qualifying that statement against the
   capabilities of Oculus Link on Quest.</p> <p>Again, as we learn more
   about Oculus Link on the path to its November launch, maybe it&#8217;ll
   become more clear why someone would still want to choice Rift S over
   Quest, but from what the company has revealed thus far, it just
   isn&#8217;t clear.</p> <span

   Half Dome prototype showed off last year.</p> <p><span
   id="more-90840"></span></p> <p>Last year Facebook showed off Half Dome,
   a prototype VR headset which offered up a much larger field of view
   than current Rift or Quest headsets, as well as varifocal displays
   which allows the headset to display a more comfortable and natural view
   to our human eyes.</p> <p>Today the company revealed two new versions
   of Half Dome, simply called Half Dome 2 and Half Dome 3. While both
   still aim to deliver a wider field of view and varifocal display, they
   also focus on reducing the form-factor to make headsets smaller and
   more comfortable.</p> <p><iframe width="640" height="360"

   frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media;
   gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>While
   the original Half Dome used mechanic actuators to move the screen in
   order to achieve the varifocal feature, Half Dome 2 does this through a
   voice coil actuator which reduces sound and vibrations of the varifocal
   mechanism to &#8220;imperceptible&#8221; levels.</p> <p>What&#8217;s
   more, Half Dome 2 brings major advancements in the optical pipeline,
   substantially reducing the size of the headset form-factor. Abrash said
   this was achieved by &#8220;folding the optical path into a very small
   volume.&#8221; Indeed, renderings of the optical modules between Half
   Dome and Half Dome 2 show a drastic reduction in size.</p> <figure

   further. Instead of physically moving the display in order to achieve
   varifocal capability, the Half Dome 3 prototype uses an electronically
   controlled lens array which allows it to cycle through 64 discrete
   focus planes.</p> <figure id="attachment_90846" style="width: 640px"

   <p>This further shrinks the size of the optical module, making Half
   Dome 3 even more compact.</p> <p>Abrash did say that Half Dome 2 and 3
   had to trade-off some of the original Half Dome&#8217;s field of view
   improvements in order to achieve these compact form-factors, but said
   that even so they still offered a larger field of view than current
   Rift and Quest headsets.</p> <figure id="attachment_90847"

   unveiled a project yet, and says that the†process of experimenting and
   honing new interactions will be made public in some sense.</p>
   <p>&#8220;The plan is to post GIFs, experiments, stories, videos,
   examples, and other random peeks into our process. Itôs wacky, we know.
   But secrets are dumb anyway,&#8221; the studio explains.</p>
   <p>Although there&#8217;s nothing to show today, Absurd Joy has†outlined
   a few principles it wants to follow in its future experimentations,
   namely making AR/VR interactions more naturalistic and not forcing
   people to learn ad hoc concepts like unnatural gestures, making it fun,
   and breaking from the mould of using AR/VR as a games-only medium.</p>

   game is being published by Oculus Studios for Rift, which means it will
   be exclusive to the Oculus platform, and only officially available on
   the Rift (though with any luck it&#8217;ll <a
   href="https://www.roadtovr.com/valve-index-revive-oculus-rift-exclusive

   workaround</a>).</p> <p>Medal of Honor is a storied franchise spanning
   more than 15 games, with the first title launching in 1999. With eight
   years between the most recent Medal of Honor game (2012) and this
   upcoming 2020 rebirth, it&#8217;ll be very interesting to see how
   Respawn re-imagines the franchise for VR, and whether it can truly
   carry it forward.</p> <p>So far Respawn hasn&#8217;t offered too much
   detail on the features of the game, but at this point it&#8217;s clear
   it&#8217;ll be a WWII action shooting game. Hopefully it won&#8217;t be
   long until we learn more.</p> <span

   &#8220;we&#8217;re building an AR headset.&#8221; This has been more or
   less known for some time, but now the company is talking about the
   steps its taking to actually get there.</p> <p>In order to deliver the
   vision of breaking down the barrier between the real and digital
   worlds, Facebook says they first need a digital copy of the real worldîa
   foundation for an augmented reality headset to understand and interact
   with reality.</p> <p><iframe width="640" height="360"

   <p>Facebook is calling it LiveMaps, and says it will be a
   &#8220;multi-layer representation of the world,&#8221; and one which
   will†crowdsource†data from connected devices in real time to provide a
   constantly updated picture of the real world.</p> <p>This isn&#8217;t
   just about tracking a device&#8217;s location in physical space (though
   that will surely be an important part of it), it&#8217;s about laying a
   comprehensive foundation for augmented reality devices to understand
   and digitally modify our world.</p> <div class="rtovrintelly"

   announced an upcoming software feature called Oculus Link which will
   allow Quest headsets to tether to VR ready PCs to play any game in the
   Oculus Rift library.</p> <p><span id="more-90808"></span></p> <p>Oculus
   Quest, which currently runs a separate library of content from the
   PC-based Rift headsets, will soon be able to tether to high-end PCs to
   play the entire Oculus Rift library.</p> <p>This is a major boon for
   owners of the headset who, if they have a VR ready PC already, will now
   be able to play many top titles that were previously unavailable on
   Quest.</p> <p>The feature, called Oculus Link, will use a USB cable to
   tether the headset to a computer, effectively turning it into a
   tethered PC VR headset. Facebook said this feature will launch in
   November.</p> <p>Assuming it works with no compromises over the Rift S,
   this also means that customers also now have two choices in an Oculus
   PC headset.</p> <hr /> <p><strong><em>This story is breaking, check

   announced on stage at Oculus Connect 6 that Quest will soon have
   hand-tracking. Zuckerberg maintains it will arrive on Quest sometime
   early next year as an experimental feature for consumers and an SDK for
   developers.</p> <p>In a <a
   href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/introducing-hand-tracking-on-oculus-q
   uest-bringing-your-real-hands-into-vr/" target="_blank"
   rel="noopener">blogpost</a>, the company says its computer vision team
   developed &#8220;a new method of using deep learning to understand the
   position of your fingers using just the monochrome cameras on Quest
   today.&#8221; This means no active depth-sensing cameras, additional
   sensors, or extra processors required. It can, the company says,
   approximate the shape of your hand and creates a set of 3D points to
   accurately represent your hand and finger movement in VR.</p> <p>It
   will also be available for demo here at OC6, so we&#8217;ll be bringing
   our impressions to you as soon as possible. Check out the reveal video

   <p>úArizona Sunshine was one of the first full-feature games developed
   exclusively for VR. Ever since, weôve been eager to take it up a few
   notches and push hard at the boundaries of VR again,ù said Richard
   Stitselaar, Studio Director at Vertigo Games. úWith After the Fall, weôre
   bringing VR to life at a scale we believe hasnôt been done before ì a
   seamless multiplayer experience shared with as many players as possible
   set in a dynamic world that will keep them coming back for more.ù</p>
   <p>Vertigo is hosting demos of<em> After the Fall†</em>at E3 this year.
   We have feet on the ground in Los Angeles for the event, so check back
   soon.</p> <p><iframe width="640" height="360"

   exact same strap as Vive Pro! Vive Pro strap always felt very good on
   my head though. But Pimax5k+ was terrible on my eyes, impossible for me
   to comfortable use it. I do hope they&#039;ve improved things since
   then. In any case I&#039;m plenty happy with my Valve Index for now.

   +0000 https://www.roadtovr.com/?p=90856#comment-147701 Have to say
   I&#039;m dissappointed by the Reverb (I use one at work). Although the
   SDE is finer, I&#039;m just as aware of it and for me at least, only
   the centre is in focus. Also, either chromatic aberration is worse, or
   the better resolution makes it more apparent; either way it&#039;s a
   distraction. But experience differs from one individual to another
   depending on your eye position relative to the lenses; let&#039;s hope
   it works for you. I was considering importing an Odyssey+; from what
   you say, I&#039;ll give that a miss. <p>Have to say I&#8217;m

   +0000 https://www.roadtovr.com/?p=90840#comment-147700 One of the
   things about getting older is that your focal range diminishes. If I
   put lenses in to focus on near objects, the distance would be out of
   focus. The varifocal system and accompanying eye-tracking (could not
   work without this) would also add a lot of unnecessary cost for me. As
   others have said, just give us the wider FOV. Of course, more
   seriously, some people cannot use VR because of the disparity between
   eye convergence and accommodation, which is what Oculus are addressing

   year when all this gets close to release, it would be nice to have

   option. Newer snapdragon chip, perhaps slightly increased FOV. I would
   consider buying the device then. Real 2.0 may be a few years off.. but

   Later this year Oculus Quest is going to get access to a heap of new VR
   content thanks to support for Oculus Go apps via official emulation.

   Oculus CTO John Carmack this week confirmed that Oculus Quest will
   eventually support Oculus Go apps ‚Äúby way of a compatibility layer that
   makes Quest report as a Go and emulate the Go controller for old apps.‚Äù
   The feature will be added sometime later this year, and will
   potentially bring hundreds of new apps to Oculus Quest.

   It isn‚Äôt clear if the entire library of Oculus Go content will be
   unleashed on Quest out of the gate; a likely scenario would be that
   that Oculus asks developers of Go apps to opt-in to allow their Go app
   to run on Quest.

   ‚ÄúWe will be working with developers to test against the emulator, but I
   hope some will be inspired enough to convert older apps to proper
   ‚Äòhybrid‚Äô Go / Quest apps with explicit support,‚Äù said Carmack.

   While Go apps aren‚Äôt built to support Quest‚Äôs 6DOF head and controller
   tracking, Carmack says that, for many apps, the emulation brings full
   tracking and then some.

   ‚ÄúNot everything works, but many old apps do magically get 6DOF headset
   and controller tracking, as well as higher resolution and frame rate,
   so it is fun to dig through some old favorites,‚Äù he said.

   The move seems at odds with Oculus‚Äô decision to be more strict about
   the quality of apps it will allow on Quest compared to its other
   headsets.

   ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve set a high bar for content quality on Quest, higher than we‚Äôve
   ever enforced before, in order to build a platform where everyone has
   confidence in the quality of the titles they‚Äôre buying and developers
   know that their investments have a strong chance of success,‚Äù the
   company said about the decision back in February.

   Indeed, Oculus Quest has a far smaller library of apps available today
   than Oculus Go, but the selection is choice compared to many smaller
   scope and generally less polished apps in the Go library. And while
   there‚Äôs certainly some gems on Go, allowing Quest to run Go apps‚Äîwhich
   weren‚Äôt even designed for the headset in the first place‚Äîseems like it
   could become a trojan horse for getting apps onto Quest which otherwise
   wouldn‚Äôt meet Oculus‚Äô more stringent quality standards. We‚Äôve reached
   out to the company to understand how they‚Äôll approach this.

       Rebuild the Hybrid is only good way‚Ä¶emulation Sucks at all 4s.
     * Mateusz Pawluczuk
       Finally some common sense. There‚Äôs just so much media oriented
       content on the Go whether it‚Äôs animation, interactive stories,
       meditation apps, various VR180 stuff (even Rodriguez‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Limit‚Äù
       with it‚Äôs mixed reviews is still a kind of milestone).

       One thing Quest is missing is iPhone (or whatever smart phone)
       screen mirroring. Big Screen Beta is sweet for casting from the
       computer but for portability casting from a cell would be deadly.
     * TonyVT SkarredGhost
       Nice idea‚Ä¶ I think we needed this. The problem is that Go has not
       the same content curation of Quest and so I wonder how they will
       manage this

   Plus headset, which is slated to launch on October 30th, has the same

   &#8220;8K&#8221; Plus comes with optional 65/72/90 Hz refresh rate.</p>
   <p>Both headsets are said to include between 10-15% better panel
   utilization over its predecessor and the same 170-degree horizontal
   field of view. Both however will arrive†with a new modular audio strap
   and a wider facial interface called a &#8216;comfort kit&#8217;.</p>

   upcoming PC tethering feature coming to Quest headsets in November.
   Oculus Link, as it&#8217;s called, will let users plug into VR ready
   PCs and play games originally designed for Rift. Oculus is calling it
   &#8220;the best of both worlds,&#8221; but then where does that leave
   their latest PC VR headset, Rift S?</p> <p><span
   id="more-90856"></span></p> <p>Quest and Rift S, Oculus&#8217; newest
   headsets, launched just six months ago, but it wasn&#8217;t until today
   that Oculus announced a PC tethering featureîsomething which customers
   had been asking about well before the launch of the headsets.</p>
   <p>For many contemplating picking up one of the two headsets, the
   fundamental equation boiled down to this:</p> <ul> <li>Rift S: Costs
   $400;†plays high-end games connected to PC</li> <li>Quest: Costs $400;
   plays low-end games with no PC</li> </ul> <p>If you wanted the high-end
   experience, you&#8217;d clearly pick the Rift S. If you wanted
   portability and convenience, you&#8217;d pick Quest.</p> <p>But
   today&#8217;s announcement, as near as we can tell, completely changes
   that equation.</p> <ul> <li>Rift S: Costs $400; plays high-end games
   connected to PC</li> <li>Quest: Costs $400;†plays low-end games with no
   PC†<em>and</em>†plays high-end games connected to PC</li> </ul> <p>So why
   would anyone buy a Rift S for the same price as Quest when the latter
   effectively has twice the functionality? Yes, there&#8217;s some
   technical differences between the headsetsîthe display tech is a bit
   different and so are the ergonomicsîbut hardly enough to be
   consequential in the face of mobile + PC functionality vs. PC-only
   functionality.</p> <p>In fact, with Oculus Link, Oculus is calling
   Quest &#8220;the best of both worlds.&#8221; So&#8230; would you like
   &#8216;the best of both worlds for&#8217; $400, or &#8216;not the best
   of both worlds&#8217; for $400. The choice appears so obvious that the
   question itself seems an affront to your intelligence.</p> <p>Granted,
   Oculus Link won&#8217;t come until November, and there&#8217;s still
   some unanswered questions about exactly how it will work, which could
   make things a little less clear-cut. But at present, our understanding
   is that Oculus Link will turn question into a full-fledged PC VR
   headset. Oculus has confirmed to <em>Road to VR</em>†that Quest will not
   just be able to play the entire Rift library, it&#8217;ll be able to
   use all the same platform functionality that Rift uses, like Dash,
   Oculus Home, etc.</p> <p>For the record, I think that Oculus is making
   the right choice for the future by making Oculus Link and Quest PC
   tethering a reality. That said, there&#8217;s no denying that
   it&#8217;s creating an awkward moment for its customersîmany of whom had
   been suggesting all along that Quest should logically connect to PCs to
   no avail and then being shunted to buying a Rift S when Quest
   didn&#8217;t get have it at launch.</p> <p>If Oculus Link really does
   turn Quest into a full featured PC VR headset, then who the hell is
   Rift S for?</p> <p>Rift S already seemed like an awkward sibling rather
   than a proper sequel to the original Rift. Because many of the changes
   from Rift to Rift S felt like side-steps (or maybe even like
   downgrades) the Rift S wasn&#8217;t exactly an obvious upgrade for
   existing Rift owners.</p> <div class="rtovrintelly" style="clear:both;

   Choice for VR Newcomers, a Difficult Choice for VR
   Vets</div></div></div></div></a></div> <p>The only reasonable strategy
   for Oculus from here may follow this line of thought: slash the price
   of the Rift S down to $300 or even $200, thereby turning it into the
   unassailable recommendation for anyone looking to take their first step
   into PC VR. And while they&#8217;re at it, Oculus might want to think
   of a way to compensate their loyal and enthusiastic early adopter
   customers who may have begrudgingly chose Rift S over Quest so that
   they could stay in the PC VR ecosystem, only to watch the other headset
   subsume that functionality a few months later.</p> <p>So far, Oculus
   hasn&#8217;t said anything about plans to change pricing or strategy.
   The company tells†<em>Road to VR</em> that it will continue to sell the
   Rift S, and that it is still positioning the headset as &#8220;the gold
   standard for performance, graphics and the most immersive VR
   gameplay,&#8221; but without qualifying that statement against the
   capabilities of Oculus Link on Quest.</p> <p>Again, as we learn more
   about Oculus Link on the path to its November launch, maybe it&#8217;ll
   become more clear why someone would still want to choice Rift S over
   Quest, but from what the company has revealed thus far, it just
   isn&#8217;t clear.</p> <span

   and Half Dome 3. Both headsets offer improvements over the original
   Half Dome prototype showed off last year.</p> <p><span
   id="more-90840"></span></p> <p>Last year Facebook showed off Half Dome,
   a prototype VR headset which offered up a much larger field of view
   than current Rift or Quest headsets, as well as varifocal displays
   which allows the headset to display a more comfortable and natural view
   to our human eyes.</p> <p>Today the company revealed two new versions
   of Half Dome, simply called Half Dome 2 and Half Dome 3. While both
   still aim to deliver a wider field of view and varifocal display, they
   also focus on reducing the form-factor to make headsets smaller and
   more comfortable.</p> <p><iframe width="640" height="360"

   frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media;
   gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>While
   the original Half Dome used mechanic actuators to move the screen in
   order to achieve the varifocal feature, Half Dome 2 does this through a
   voice coil actuator which reduces sound and vibrations of the varifocal
   mechanism to &#8220;imperceptible&#8221; levels.</p> <p>What&#8217;s
   more, Half Dome 2 brings major advancements in the optical pipeline,
   substantially reducing the size of the headset form-factor. Abrash said
   this was achieved by &#8220;folding the optical path into a very small
   volume.&#8221; Indeed, renderings of the optical modules between Half
   Dome and Half Dome 2 show a drastic reduction in size.</p> <figure

   Oculus</figcaption></figure> <p>Half Dome 3 takes this one step
   further. Instead of physically moving the display in order to achieve
   varifocal capability, the Half Dome 3 prototype uses an electronically
   controlled lens array which allows it to cycle through 64 discrete
   focus planes.</p> <figure id="attachment_90846" style="width: 640px"

   <p>This further shrinks the size of the optical module, making Half
   Dome 3 even more compact.</p> <p>Abrash did say that Half Dome 2 and 3
   had to trade-off some of the original Half Dome&#8217;s field of view
   improvements in order to achieve these compact form-factors, but said
   that even so they still offered a larger field of view than current
   Rift and Quest headsets.</p> <figure id="attachment_90847"

   unveiled a project yet, and says that the†process of experimenting and
   honing new interactions will be made public in some sense.</p>
   <p>&#8220;The plan is to post GIFs, experiments, stories, videos,
   examples, and other random peeks into our process. Itôs wacky, we know.
   But secrets are dumb anyway,&#8221; the studio explains.</p>
   <p>Although there&#8217;s nothing to show today, Absurd Joy has†outlined
   a few principles it wants to follow in its future experimentations,
   namely making AR/VR interactions more naturalistic and not forcing
   people to learn ad hoc concepts like unnatural gestures, making it fun,
   and breaking from the mould of using AR/VR as a games-only medium.</p>

   game is being published by Oculus Studios for Rift, which means it will
   be exclusive to the Oculus platform, and only officially available on

   more than 15 games, with the first title launching in 1999. With eight
   years between the most recent Medal of Honor game (2012) and this
   upcoming 2020 rebirth, it&#8217;ll be very interesting to see how
   Respawn re-imagines the franchise for VR, and whether it can truly
   carry it forward.</p> <p>So far Respawn hasn&#8217;t offered too much
   detail on the features of the game, but at this point it&#8217;s clear
   it&#8217;ll be a WWII action shooting game. Hopefully it won&#8217;t be

   announced on stage at Oculus Connect 6 that Quest will soon have
   hand-tracking. Zuckerberg maintains it will arrive on Quest sometime
   early next year as an experimental feature for consumers and an SDK for

   href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/introducing-hand-tracking-on-oculus-q
   uest-bringing-your-real-hands-into-vr/" target="_blank"
   rel="noopener">blogpost</a>, the company says its computer vision team
   developed &#8220;a new method of using deep learning to understand the
   position of your fingers using just the monochrome cameras on Quest
   today.&#8221; This means no active depth-sensing cameras, additional
   sensors, or extra processors required. It can, the company says,
   approximate the shape of your hand and creates a set of 3D points to
   accurately represent your hand and finger movement in VR.</p> <p>It
   will also be available for demo here at OC6, so we&#8217;ll be bringing
   our impressions to you as soon as possible. Check out the reveal video

   ice-covered ruins of an alternate 1980s Los Angeles, After the Fall
   pits up to four players against a vast, hostile world in a raging fight
   for control of the city and the survival of humanity. Go solo or join
   forces with players worldwide as you scavenge the remains of
   civilization, face relentless hordes and larger-than-life bosses, craft
   a huge range of guns and deadly close combat weapons, and wield
   devastating powers with real-life movements.</p></blockquote> <style

   <p>úArizona Sunshine was one of the first full-feature games developed
   exclusively for VR. Ever since, weôve been eager to take it up a few
   notches and push hard at the boundaries of VR again,ù said Richard
   Stitselaar, Studio Director at Vertigo Games. úWith After the Fall, weôre
   bringing VR to life at a scale we believe hasnôt been done before ì a
   seamless multiplayer experience shared with as many players as possible
   set in a dynamic world that will keep them coming back for more.ù</p>
   <p>Vertigo is hosting demos of<em> After the Fall†</em>at E3 this year.
   We have feet on the ground in Los Angeles for the event, so check back

   exact same strap as Vive Pro! Vive Pro strap always felt very good on
   my head though. But Pimax5k+ was terrible on my eyes, impossible for me
   to comfortable use it. I do hope they&#039;ve improved things since
   then. In any case I&#039;m plenty happy with my Valve Index for now.

   +0000 https://www.roadtovr.com/?p=90856#comment-147701 Have to say
   I&#039;m dissappointed by the Reverb (I use one at work). Although the
   SDE is finer, I&#039;m just as aware of it and for me at least, only
   the centre is in focus. Also, either chromatic aberration is worse, or
   the better resolution makes it more apparent; either way it&#039;s a
   distraction. But experience differs from one individual to another
   depending on your eye position relative to the lenses; let&#039;s hope
   it works for you. I was considering importing an Odyssey+; from what
   you say, I&#039;ll give that a miss. <p>Have to say I&#8217;m

   +0000 https://www.roadtovr.com/?p=90840#comment-147700 One of the
   things about getting older is that your focal range diminishes. If I
   put lenses in to focus on near objects, the distance would be out of
   focus. The varifocal system and accompanying eye-tracking (could not
   work without this) would also add a lot of unnecessary cost for me. As
   others have said, just give us the wider FOV. Of course, more
   seriously, some people cannot use VR because of the disparity between
   eye convergence and accommodation, which is what Oculus are addressing

   hand tracking etc is not coming out tomorrow either. By the end of next
   year when all this gets close to release, it would be nice to have
   option for Quest Pro. Let&#039;s not call it 2.0, but &quot;pro&quot;
   option. Newer snapdragon chip, perhaps slightly increased FOV. I would
   consider buying the device then. Real 2.0 may be a few years off.. but
   PRO is needed now. <p>Yes true, bet hand tracking etc is not coming out
