UI Design Do’s and Don’ts

   iOS raises the bar for excellence in user interface design and offers
   great opportunities for you to deliver engaging and unique user
   experiences. Consider these common design concepts before you start
   coding to enhance the usability and appeal of your apps. To see more
   recommendations for great interface design, read the iOS Human
   Interface Guidelines.

     * Clarity

Formatting Content

   Create a layout that fits the screen of an iOS device. Users should see
   primary content without zooming or scrolling horizontally.

Touch Controls

   Use UI elements that are designed for touch gestures to make
   interaction with your app feel easy and natural.
   Learn more

Hit Targets

   Create controls that measure at least 44 points x 44 points so they can
   be accurately tapped with a finger.
   Learn more

Text Size

   Text should be at least 11 points so it’s legible at a typical viewing
   distance without zooming.
   Learn more

Contrast

   Make sure there is ample contrast between the font color and the
   background so text is legible.
   Learn more

Spacing

   Don’t let text overlap. Improve legibility by increasing line height or
   letter spacing.
   Learn more

High Resolution

   Provide high-resolution versions of all image assets. Images that are
   not @2x and @3x will appear blurry on the Retina display.
   Learn more

Distortion

   Always display images at their intended aspect ratio to avoid
   distortion.
   Learn more

Organization

   Create an easy-to-read layout that puts controls close to the content
   they modify.
   Learn more

Alignment

   Align text, images, and buttons to show users how information is
   related.

iOS Design Themes

   As an app designer, you have the opportunity to deliver an
   extraordinary product that rises to the top of the App Store charts. To
   do so, you'll need to meet high expectations for quality and
   functionality.

   Three primary themes differentiate iOS from other platforms:
     * Clarity. Throughout the system, text is legible at every size,
       icons are precise and lucid, adornments are subtle and appropriate,
       and a sharpened focus on functionality motivates the design.
       Negative space, color, fonts, graphics, and interface elements
       subtly highlight important content and convey interactivity.
     * Deference. Fluid motion and a crisp, beautiful interface help
       people understand and interact with content while never competing
       with it. Content typically fills the entire screen, while
       translucency and blurring often hint at more. Minimal use of
       bezels, gradients, and drop shadows keep the interface light and
       airy, while ensuring that content is paramount.
     * Depth. Distinct visual layers and realistic motion convey
       hierarchy, impart vitality, and facilitate understanding. Touch and
       discoverability heighten delight and enable access to functionality
       and additional content without losing context. Transitions provide
       a sense of depth as you navigate through content.

Design Principles

   To maximize impact and reach, keep the following principles in mind as
   you imagine your app’s identity.

Aesthetic Integrity

   Aesthetic integrity represents how well an app’s appearance and
   behavior integrate with its function. For example, an app that helps
   people perform a serious task can keep them focused by using subtle,
   unobtrusive graphics, standard controls, and predictable behaviors. On
   the other hand, an immersive app, such as a game, can deliver a
   captivating appearance that promises fun and excitement, while
   encouraging discovery.

Consistency

   A consistent app implements familiar standards and paradigms by using
   system-provided interface elements, well-known icons, standard text
   styles, and uniform terminology. The app incorporates features and
   behaviors in ways people expect.

Direct Manipulation

   The direct manipulation of onscreen content engages people and
   facilitates understanding. Users experience direct manipulation when
   they rotate the device or use gestures to affect onscreen content.
   Through direct manipulation, they can see the immediate, visible
   results of their actions.

Feedback

   Feedback acknowledges actions and shows results to keep people
   informed. The built-in iOS apps provide perceptible feedback in
   response to every user action. Interactive elements are highlighted
   briefly when tapped, progress indicators communicate the status of
   long-running operations, and animation and sound help clarify the
   results of actions.

Metaphors

   People learn more quickly when an app’s virtual objects and actions are
   metaphors for familiar experiences—whether rooted in the real or
   digital world. Metaphors work well in iOS because people physically
   interact with the screen. They move views out of the way to expose
   content beneath. They drag and swipe content. They toggle switches,
   move sliders, and scroll through picker values. They even flick through
   pages of books and magazines.

User Control

   Throughout iOS, people—not apps—are in control. An app can suggest a
   course of action or warn about dangerous consequences, but it’s usually
   a mistake for the app to take over the decision-making. The best apps
   find the correct balance between enabling users and avoiding unwanted
   outcomes. An app can make people feel like they’re in control by
   keeping interactive elements familiar and predictable, confirming
   destructive actions, and making it easy to cancel operations, even when
   they’re already underway.

UI Design Do’s and Don’ts

   iOS raises the bar for excellence in user interface design and offers
   great opportunities for you to deliver engaging and unique user
   experiences. Consider these common design concepts before you start
   coding to enhance the usability and appeal of your apps. To see more
   recommendations for great interface design, read the iOS Human
   Interface Guidelines.

     * Interactivity
     * Readability
     * Graphics
     * Clarity

Formatting Content

   Create a layout that fits the screen of an iOS device. Users should see
   primary content without zooming or scrolling horizontally.
   Learn more

Touch Controls

   Use UI elements that are designed for touch gestures to make
   interaction with your app feel easy and natural.
   Learn more

Hit Targets

   Create controls that measure at least 44 points x 44 points so they can
   be accurately tapped with a finger.
   Learn more

Text Size

   Text should be at least 11 points so it’s legible at a typical viewing
   distance without zooming.
   Learn more

Contrast

   Make sure there is ample contrast between the font color and the
   background so text is legible.
   Learn more

Spacing

   Don’t let text overlap. Improve legibility by increasing line height or
   letter spacing.
   Learn more

High Resolution

   Provide high-resolution versions of all image assets. Images that are
   not @2x and @3x will appear blurry on the Retina display.
   Learn more

Distortion

   Always display images at their intended aspect ratio to avoid
   distortion.
   Learn more

Organization

   Create an easy-to-read layout that puts controls close to the content
   they modify.
   Learn more

Alignment

   Align text, images, and buttons to show users how information is
   related.

iOS Design Themes

   As an app designer, you have the opportunity to deliver an
   extraordinary product that rises to the top of the App Store charts. To
   do so, you'll need to meet high expectations for quality and
   functionality.

   Three primary themes differentiate iOS from other platforms:
     * Clarity. Throughout the system, text is legible at every size,
       icons are precise and lucid, adornments are subtle and appropriate,
       and a sharpened focus on functionality motivates the design.
       Negative space, color, fonts, graphics, and interface elements
       subtly highlight important content and convey interactivity.
     * Deference. Fluid motion and a crisp, beautiful interface help
       people understand and interact with content while never competing
       with it. Content typically fills the entire screen, while
       translucency and blurring often hint at more. Minimal use of
       bezels, gradients, and drop shadows keep the interface light and
       airy, while ensuring that content is paramount.
     * Depth. Distinct visual layers and realistic motion convey
       hierarchy, impart vitality, and facilitate understanding. Touch and
       discoverability heighten delight and enable access to functionality
       and additional content without losing context. Transitions provide
       a sense of depth as you navigate through content.

Design Principles

   To maximize impact and reach, keep the following principles in mind as
   you imagine your app’s identity.

Aesthetic Integrity

   Aesthetic integrity represents how well an app’s appearance and
   behavior integrate with its function. For example, an app that helps
   people perform a serious task can keep them focused by using subtle,
   unobtrusive graphics, standard controls, and predictable behaviors. On
   the other hand, an immersive app, such as a game, can deliver a
   captivating appearance that promises fun and excitement, while
   encouraging discovery.

Consistency

   A consistent app implements familiar standards and paradigms by using
   system-provided interface elements, well-known icons, standard text
   styles, and uniform terminology. The app incorporates features and
   behaviors in ways people expect.

Direct Manipulation

   The direct manipulation of onscreen content engages people and
   facilitates understanding. Users experience direct manipulation when
   they rotate the device or use gestures to affect onscreen content.
   Through direct manipulation, they can see the immediate, visible
   results of their actions.

Feedback

   Feedback acknowledges actions and shows results to keep people
   informed. The built-in iOS apps provide perceptible feedback in
   response to every user action. Interactive elements are highlighted
   briefly when tapped, progress indicators communicate the status of
   long-running operations, and animation and sound help clarify the
   results of actions.

Metaphors

   People learn more quickly when an app’s virtual objects and actions are
   metaphors for familiar experiences—whether rooted in the real or
   digital world. Metaphors work well in iOS because people physically
   interact with the screen. They move views out of the way to expose
   content beneath. They drag and swipe content. They toggle switches,
   move sliders, and scroll through picker values. They even flick through
   pages of books and magazines.

User Control

   Throughout iOS, people—not apps—are in control. An app can suggest a
   course of action or warn about dangerous consequences, but it’s usually
   a mistake for the app to take over the decision-making. The best apps
   find the correct balance between enabling users and avoiding unwanted
   outcomes. An app can make people feel like they’re in control by
   keeping interactive elements familiar and predictable, confirming
   destructive actions, and making it easy to cancel operations, even when
   they’re already underway.

   modes in your app. If your app is running in iOS 12 or earlier, or if
   you need to create custom bitmap icons, follow the guidance below.

   Create recognizable, highly-simplified designs. Too many details can
   make an icon confusing or unreadable. Strive for a simple, universal
   design that most people will recognize quickly and won’t find
   offensive. The best icons use familiar visual metaphors that are
   directly related to the actions they initiate or content they reveal.

   Glyph (color applied)

   Design icons as glyphs. A glyph, also known as a template image, is a
   monochromatic image with transparency, anti-aliasing, and no drop
   shadow that uses a mask to define its shape. Glyphs automatically
   receive the appropriate appearance—including coloring, highlighting,
   and vibrancy—based on the context and user interactions. A variety of
   standard interface elements support glyphs, including navigation bars,
   tab bars, toolbars, and Home screen quick actions.

   Prepare glyphs with a scale factor of @2x and save them as PDFs.
   Because PDF is a vector format that allows for high-resolution scaling,
   it's typically sufficient to provide a single @2x version in your app
   and allow it to scale for other resolutions.

   Keep your icons consistent. Whether you use only custom icons or mix
   custom and system icons, all icons in your app should be the same in
   terms of level of detail, optical weight, stroke weight, position, and
   perspective.

   alarm clock, a heart, an envelope, and a conversation bubble. All six
   glyphs are solid gray; some include interior detail lines, all of which
   use the same weight.

   Make sure icons are legible. In general, solid icons tend to be clearer
   than outlined icons. If an icon must includes lines, coordinate the
   weight with other icons and your app's typography.

   indicate active and the icon on the right is solid gray to indicate
   inactive. A green checkmark shows that this is the recommended
   approach.

   blue to indicate active and the icon on the right is solid gray to
   indicate inactive. A red Ex shows that this is not the recommended
   approach.

   Use color to communicate selected and deselected states. Avoid toggling
   between two different icon designs, like a solid version and an
   outlined version.

   Avoid including text in an icon. If you need text, display a label
   beneath the icon and adjust its placement accordingly.

   Don’t use replicas of Apple hardware products. Apple products are
   copyrighted and can’t be reproduced in your icons or images. In
   general, avoid displaying replicas of devices because hardware designs
   tend to change frequently and can make your icon look dated.

   Provide alternative text labels for icons. Alternative text labels
   aren’t visible onscreen, but they let VoiceOver audibly describe what's
   onscreen, making navigation easier for people with visual impairments.

Custom Icon Sizes

   Above all, your app's icon family should be visually consistent in
   size. If individual icon designs vary in weight, some icons may need to
   be slightly larger than others to achieve this effect.

   Images of six glyphs, representing a video camera, a still camera, an
   alarm clock, a heart, an envelope, and a conversation bubble. Three
   horizontal dashed lines show that the alarm clock and bubble glpyhs are
   the tallest glyphs because of their greater weight.

Home Screen Quick Action Icon Size

   A Home screen quick action icon appears next to the title. If you need
   to create a custom icon for your Home screen quick action, use the
   following sizes for guidance.

   Image of a solid blue square, which represents the maximum size, with
   the outline of a smaller square centered inside it. A vertical line,
   extending to the top and bottom edges of the outer square, represents
   the maximum height. A horizontal line, extending to the left and right
   edges of the outer square, represents the maximum width.
         Maximum width and height
   104px × 104px (34.67pt × 34.67pt @3x)
   70px × 70px (35pt × 35pt @2x)

   Image of a solid blue square, which represents the target, centered
   inside a larger, white square. A vertical line, extending to the top
   and bottom edges of the inner square, represents the target's height. A
   horizontal line, extending to left and right edges of the inner square,
   represents the target's width.
         Target width and height
   80px × 80px (26.67pt × 26.67pt @3x)
   54px × 54px (27pt × 27pt @2x)

   Image of a solid blue rectangle, which represents the target, inside
   the outline of a larger square. The width of the rectangle is slightly
   larger than its height. A horizontal line, extending to the left and
   right edges of the rectangle, indicates the target's width.
   Target width (wide glyphs)
   88px (29.33pt @3x)
   60px (30pt @2x)

   Image of a solid blue rectangle, which represents the target, inside
   the outline of a larger square. The height of the rectangle is slightly
   larger than its width. A vertical line, extending to the top and bottom
   edges of the rectangle, indicates the target's height.
   Target height (tall glyphs)
   88px (29.33pt @3x)
   60px (30pt @2x)

Navigation Bar and Toolbar Icon Size

   Use the following sizes for guidance when preparing custom navigation
   bar and toolbar icons, but adjust as needed to create balance.
           Target sizes                  Maximum sizes
   72px × 72px (24pt × 24pt @3x) 84px × 84px (28pt × 28pt @3x)
   48px × 48px (24pt × 24pt @2x) 56px × 56px (28pt × 28pt @2x)

Tab Bar Icon Size

   In portrait orientation, tab bar icons appear above tab titles. In
   landscape orientation, the icons and titles appear side-by-side.
   Depending on the device and orientation, the system displays either a
   regular or compact tab bar. Your app should include custom tab bar
   icons for both sizes.

   Target width and height (circular glyphs)

   Image of a solid blue circle, which represents the target, centered
   inside the outlines of two squares. All three shapes are contained
   within the outline of a rectangle. The width of the inner square is
   slightly smaller than the diameter of the circle. The width of the
   outer square is the same as the diameter of the circle. The width of
   the rectangle is slightly larger than its height. A vertical line,
   extending to the top and bottom edges of the outer square, indicates
   the target's height. A horizontal line, extending to left and right
   edges of the outer square, represents the target's width.
         Regular tab bars              Compact tab bars
   75px × 75px (25pt × 25pt @3x) 54px × 54px (18pt × 18pt @3x)
   50px × 50px (25pt × 25pt @2x) 36px × 36px (18pt × 18pt @2x)

   Target width and height (square glyphs)

   Image of a solid blue square, which represents the target, centered
   inside the outline of a slightly larger square. Both shapes are
   contained within the outline of a rectangle. The solid blue square is
   slightly smaller than the outlined square. The width of the rectangle
   is slightly larger than its height. A vertical line, extending to the
   top and bottom edges of the blue square, represents the square's
   height. A horizontal line, extending to left and right edges of the
   blue square, indicates the target's width.
         Regular tab bars              Compact tab bars
   69px × 69px (23pt × 23pt @3x) 51px × 51px (17pt × 17pt @3x)
   46px × 46px (23pt × 23pt @2x) 34px × 34px (17pt × 17pt @2x)

   Target width (wide glyphs)

   Image of a solid blue rectangle, which represents the target,
   vertically centered inside the outline of a larger rectangle. The
   height of the blue rectangle is approximately half the height of the
   outlined rectangle. The outlines of two squares are horizontally
   centered within the outlined rectangle. The width of the outlined
   rectangle is slightly larger than its height. A horizontal line,
   extending to left and right edges of the outlined rectangle, represents
   the target's width.
   Regular tab bars Compact tab bars
   93px (31pt @3x)  69px (23pt @3x)
   62px (31pt @2x)  46px (23pt @2x)

   Target height (tall glyphs)

   Image of a solid blue rectangle, which represents the target,
   horizontally centered inside the outline of a larger rectangle. The
   width of the blue rectangle is approximately half the width of the
   outlined rectangle. The outlines of two squares are horizontally
   centered within the outlined rectangle. The width of the outlined
   rectangle is slightly larger than its height. A vertical line,
   extending to top and bottom edges of the outlined rectangle, represents
   the target's height.
   Regular tab bars Compact tab bars
   84px (28pt @3x)  60px (20pt @3x)

   Diffs.

   Please file any bug reports about this seed or this documentation using
   http://bugreport.apple.com/.

Major Features

   The following sections highlight features that span multiple technology
   areas or that are otherwise of particular importance in OS X v10.7.

  iCloud Storage APIs

   When you use the iCloud storage APIs, your app writes user documents
   and data to a central location. A user can view or edit those documents
   from any device without having to sync or transfer files explicitly.
   Storing documents in a user’s iCloud account also provides a layer of
   security for that user. Even if a user loses a device, the documents on
   that device are not lost if they are in iCloud storage.
   ../Art/syncing_intro.jpg ../Art/syncing_intro.jpg

   There are two types of iCloud storage that your app can take advantage
   of:
     * Use iCloud document storage to store user documents and data in a
       user’s iCloud account.
     * Use iCloud key-value data storage to share small amounts of data
       among instances of your app.

   To learn more about adding iCloud storage to your app, read iCloud
   Storage in Mac App Programming Guide.

  Automatic Reference Counting

   Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is a compiler-level feature that
   simplifies the process of managing the lifetimes of Objective-C
   objects. Instead of you having to remember when to retain or release an
   object, ARC evaluates the lifetime requirements of your objects and
   automatically inserts the appropriate method calls at compile time.
   ../Art/ARC_design_final.gif

   ARC replaces the traditional managed-memory-model style of programming
   found in earlier versions of OS X. Any new projects you create
   automatically use ARC. And Xcode provides migration tools to help
   convert existing projects to use ARC. For more information about how to
   perform this migration, see What’s New in Xcode. For more information
   about ARC itself, see Transitioning to ARC Release Notes.

  Resume

   Resume is a systemwide enhancement of the user experience, introduced
   in OS X v10.7, that supports app persistence. A user can log out or
   shut down the operating system, and on next login or startup, OS X
   automatically relaunches the apps that were last running and restores
   the windows that were last opened. If your app provides the necessary
   support, reopened windows have the same size and location as before; in
   addition, window contents are scrolled to the previous position and
   selections are restored.

   When an app that supports sudden termination goes unused or has no open
   windows, OS X may terminate it behind the scenes. When a user wants to
   use the app again, it usually relaunches instantly. Users who want to
   quit apps manually can still do so, but it is no longer necessary.

   App persistence requires you to implement the ancillary programmatic
   features of automatic and sudden app termination, user interface
   preservation, and automatic data saving.

   To learn more about the elements of Resume, read Support the Key
   Runtime Behaviors in Your Apps in Mac App Programming Guide.

  Cocoa Auto Layout

   Cocoa Auto Layout, a feature introduced in OS X v10.7, improves upon
   the “springs and struts” model previously used to lay out the elements
   of a user interface. Auto Layout is a rule-based system designed to
   implement the layout guidelines described in OS X Human Interface
   Guidelines. It expresses a larger class of relationships and is more
   intuitive to use than springs and struts.

   The entities used in Auto Layout are Objective-C objects called
   constraints. This approach brings you a number of benefits:
     * Localization through swapping of strings alone, instead of also
       revamping layouts
     * Mirroring of user-interface elements for right-to-left languages
       like Hebrew and Arabic
     * Better layering of responsibility between objects in the view and
       controller layers
       A view object usually knows best about its standard size and its
       positioning within its superview and relative to its sibling views.
       A controller can override these values if something nonstandard is
       required.

   For information about this feature, see Auto Layout Guide.

  File Coordination

   File coordination, introduced in OS X v10.7, eliminates file-system
   inconsistencies due to overlapping read and write operations from
   competing processes. When you use the NSDocument class from the AppKit
   framework, you get file coordination with very little effort. To use
   file coordination explicitly, you employ the NSFileCoordinator class
   and the NSFilePresenter protocol, both from the Foundation framework.

   Use file coordination only with files that you think users might share
   with other users, not (for example) with files written to cache or
   temporary locations. File coordination is an enabling technology for
   automatic document saving, App Sandbox, and other features introduced
   in OS X v10.7. For more information on file coordination, see
   Coordinating File Access with Other Processes in Mac App Programming
   Guide.

  Full-Screen Mode

   Starting in OS X v10.7, you can enable full-screen mode for your app by
   calling a single method. Enabling full-screen mode adds an Enter Full
   Screen menu item to the View menu or, if there is no View menu, to the
   Window menu. When a user chooses this menu item, the frontmost app or
   document window fills the entire screen.

   You enable and manage full-screen support through methods of the
   NSApplication and NSWindow classes and the NSWindowDelegate Protocol.
   To find out more about this feature, read Implementing the Full-Screen
   Experience in Mac App Programming Guide.

  Popovers

   Starting in OS X v10.7, AppKit provides support for popovers by way of
   the NSPopover class. A popover provides a means to display additional
   content related to existing content on the screen. The view containing
   the existing content—from which the popover arises—is referred to in
   this context as a positioning view. You use an anchor to express the
   relation between a popover and its positioning view.

   You configure a popover in terms of appearance and behavior. One
   important part of this task is to specify which user interactions cause
   the popover to close. By implementing the appropriate delegate method,
   you can configure a popover to detach itself and become a separate
   window when a user drags it.

   For more information, see NSPopover Class Reference and
   NSPopoverDelegate Protocol Reference. For guidelines on using popovers,
   see Popovers in OS X Human Interface Guidelines.

  App Sandbox

   Introduced in OS X v10.7, App Sandbox provides a last line of defense
   against stolen, corrupted, or deleted user data if malicious code
   exploits your app. App Sandbox also minimizes the damage from coding
   errors. Its strategy is twofold:
    1. App Sandbox enables you to describe how your app interacts with the
       system. The system then grants your app the access it needs to get
       its job done, and no more.
    2. App Sandbox allows the user to transparently grant your app
       additional access by using Open and Save dialogs, drag and drop,
       and other familiar user interactions.

   You describe your app’s interaction with the system by setting
   entitlements in Xcode. For details on all the entitlements available in
   OS X, see Entitlement Key Reference.

   Some app operations are more likely to be targets of malicious
   exploitation. Examples are the parsing of data received over a network
   and the decoding of video frames. You can improve the effectiveness of
   the damage containment offered by App Sandbox by separating such
   potentially dangerous activities into their own address spaces.

   For a complete explanation of App Sandbox and how to use it, read App
   Sandbox Design Guide.

Framework-Level Features

   The following sections highlight changes to frameworks and technologies
   in OS X v10.7.

  AV Foundation

   Introduced in OS X v10.7, the AV Foundation framework
   (AVFoundation.framework) provides services for capturing, playing,
   inspecting, editing, and reencoding time-based audiovisual media. The
   framework includes many Objective-C classes, with the core class being
   AVAsset; this class presents a uniform model and inspection interface
   for all forms and sources of audiovisual media.

   For most audio recording and playback requirements, you can use the
   AVAudioPlayer and AVAudioRecorder classes.

   AV Foundation is the recommended API for all new development involving
   time-based audiovisual media. AV Foundation is also recommended for
   transitioning existing apps that were based on QuickTime or QTKit.

   Note: The AV Foundation frameworks for OS X and iOS are almost
   identical.

   For more information about the classes of the AV Foundation framework
   and how to use them, see AVFoundation Programming Guide.

  AppKit

    Font Collections

   Starting in OS X v10.7, the NSFontCollection class provides all of the
   functionality provided by the CTFontCollectionRef opaque type, plus a
   few higher-level features to support font user interfaces. The two APIs
   are toll-free bridged.

   For more information, see NSFontCollection Class Reference.

    Multi-Image Drag and Drop

   OS X v.10.7 introduces new classes and protocols to support multi-image
   drag and drop in your app. This feature allows fine-grained control
   over the appearance of multiple dragged icons as a drag proceeds.

   When multiple items are dragged, they “flock” together. The source and
   destination apps can each influence the appearance of the icons at
   appropriate points during a drag.

   For more information, see AppKit Release Notes for macOS 10.13, the
   NSDraggingSession, NSDraggingItem, and NSDraggingImageComponent
   classes, and the NSDraggingSource and NSDraggingDestination formal
   protocols.

    Overlay Scrollbars

   OS X v10.7 introduces overlay scrollbars similar to those in iOS.
   Unless the user overrides scrollbar appearance using System
   Preferences, the following behavior occurs:
     * If all of a user’s pointing devices support both horizontal and
       vertical touch scrolling, the scrollbars are hidden during normal
       use. They appear as an overlay on top of the window’s content while
       the user is scrolling and remain visible briefly to allow scrollbar
       dragging.
     * If a user has at least one external pointing device that does not
       support scrolling, the scrollbar is displayed at all times and the
       usable space in the window is reduced, as in previous versions of
       OS X. (These permanent scrollbars are referred to as legacy
       scrollbars.)
     * If a user has no external pointing devices attached, the trackpad
       settings control the scrollbar behavior; if a user has disabled
       scrolling for the trackpad in System Preferences, legacy scrollbars
       are used.

   Compatibility Note: There are three situations in which legacy
   scrollbars are used regardless of hardware or preferences:

     * An NSScrollView with accessory views inside its scroll track
     * Any subclass of NSScroller that does not declare itself to be
       overlay-scroller compatible
     * Any NSScroller that is not managed by an NSScrollView

   In addition, the scrollbars no longer contain scroll arrows (in overlay
   mode or in legacy mode).

   Because these changes may affect your app layout, you should test your
   apps with both standard and scrolling pointing devices.

   For more information, see AppKit Release Notes for macOS 10.13.

    Scrolling Behavior

   The scroll views in OS X v10.7 allow developers additional control over
   scrolling behavior with respect to the Magic Mouse device and
   trackpads. Specifically, new methods allow the developer to control the
   stretching behavior of NSScrollView objects (auto or on/off in
   horizontal and vertical axes) and provide content hints to prevent
   unintentional scrolling drifts.

   Additionally, new NSEvent events have been added to support mouse
   momentum in scroll views.

   For more information, see AppKit Framework Reference.

    Text Autocorrection

   OS X v10.7 provides expanded UI for text autocorrection, similar to the
   functionality in iOS, with the opportunity for the user to accept or
   reject a proposed correction. As in iOS, the spell checker learns from
   the user’s responses, such as whether a correction was explicitly
   rejected, implicitly accepted, accepted at first and then revised, and
   so on.

   For more information, see AppKit Framework Reference.

    View-Based Tables and Outlines

   NSTableView and NSOutlineView in OS X v10.7 now support the use of
   NSView objects instead of NSCell objects for content. This extension
   allows apps to easily provide a much richer interface for the content
   of cells within a table view.

   OS X v10.7 also adds new functionality to provide animation of rows as
   they are added and deleted from the table view, providing a more
   context-based user experience.

   For more information, see AppKit Framework Reference.

    Window Support

   Safari, Xcode, and other apps support an in-window find. In OS X v10.7,
   this functionality has been extended to allow it to be used in views
   other than NSTextView.

   In addition, user-editable window titles allow the developer to
   programmatically begin editing the window title, typically in response
   to a user interaction.

   For more information, see AppKit Framework Reference.

  Core Data

   OS X v10.7 adds the following enhancements:
     * Core Data formalizes the concurrency model for managed object
       contexts by taking advantage of Grand Central Dispatch. When you
       create a context, you specify the dispatch queue association option
       it should adopt: confinement, private queue, or main queue.
       Contexts should always use the confinement pattern, just as they
       have prior to OS X v10.7. (In other words, you must not use the
       context on any thread other than the one on which you created it.)
       When sending messages to a context associated with a different
       queue (or thread), you must dispatch your block using the new
       performBlock: or performBlockAndWait: method.
     * You can create nested managed object contexts, in which the parent
       object store of a context is another managed object context rather
       than the persistent store coordinator. This means that fetch and
       save operations are mediated by the parent context instead of by a
       coordinator. This pattern has a number of usage scenarios,
       including:
          + Performing background operations on a second thread or queue
          + Managing discardable edits, such as in an inspector window or
            view
     * Managed objects support two significant new features: ordered
       relationships, and external storage for attribute values. If you
       specify that the value of a managed object attribute may be stored
       as an external record, Core Data heuristically decides on a
       per-value basis whether it should save the data directly in the
       database or store a URI to a separate file that it manages for you.
     * There are two new classes, NSIncrementalStore and
       NSIncrementalStoreNode, that you can use to implement support for
       nonatomic persistent stores. The store does not have to be a
       relational database—for example, you could use a web service as the
       back end.

   For more information, see Core Data Framework Reference.

  Foundation

    Index Set Range Enumeration

   OS X v10.7 adds support for enumerating ranges within an index set.

   NSIndexSet is an abstraction of a set of indexes. Developers often also
   view it as a set of noncontiguous ranges, which is a natural extension
   of this abstraction. As a result, developers often want to be able to
   enumerate the contents of an NSIndexSet object in terms of ranges,
   instead of individual indexes. Beginning in OS X v10.7, NSIndexSet
   includes convenience methods to provide this enumeration functionality.

   For more information, see NSIndexSet Class Reference.

    JSON Serialization

   In OS X 10.7, the Foundation framework adds a new class,
   NSJSONSerialization, to support conversion of JSON data
   (http://www.json.org/) into Foundation types and vice versa.

   For more information, see NSJSONSerialization and Foundation Framework
   Reference.

    Linguistic Tagging

   OS X v10.7 introduces a linguistic tagging class, NSLinguisticTagger,
   that lets you break down a sentence into its grammatical components,
   allowing the determination of nouns, verbs, adverbs, and so on. This
   tagging works fully for the English language. The API provides a method
   to find out what capabilities are currently available in other
   languages as well.

   For more information, see NSLinguisticTagger Class Reference.

    NSFileWrapper Now In Foundation

   In OS X v10.7, the NSFileWrapper class is in the Foundation framework
   instead of the AppKit framework.

   For more information, see Foundation Framework Reference and AppKit
   Framework Reference.

    Ordered Sets Support

   OS X v10.7 now provides support for ordered sets. An NSOrderedSet
   object contains each element at most once, and the elements can be
   accessed by a compact integer index space, numbered 0 .. (N-1). It thus
   combines two of the most salient features of the NSSet and NSArray
   classes.

   The NSOrderedSet class similarly borrows a lot from both NSArray and
   NSSet (and the mutable subclasses of each), but it is closer to NSArray
   than NSSet.

   The main client for NSOrderedSet is Core Data.

   For more information, see NSOrderedSet Class Reference.

    Regular Expressions

   OS X v10.7 adds a Unicode-compatible regular expression class,
   NSRegularExpression, along with related data detectors. This class is
   used to represent and apply regular expressions to Unicode strings. An
   instance of this class is an immutable representation of a compiled
   regular expression pattern and various option flags. The pattern syntax
   currently supported is that specified by International Components for
   Unicode (ICU).

   The fundamental matching method for NSRegularExpression is a block
   iterator. This method allows clients to supply a block object, which
   will be invoked each time the regular expression matches a portion of
   the target string. There are additional convenience methods for
   returning all the matches as an array, the total number of matches, the
   first match, and the range of the first match.

   For more information, see NSRegularExpression Class Reference.

    XML Streaming Parser

   Prior to OS X v.10.7, NSXMLParser always read the entire XML document
   into memory. Beginning in OS X v10.7, the class allows you to stream
   the data into memory as required.

   For more information, see NSXMLParser Class Reference.

  OpenGL 3.2

   OS X v10.7 now provides OpenGL 3.2 on hardware capable of supporting
   its feature set. Read OpenGL Programming Guide for Mac to learn about
   selecting the OpenGL 3.2 Core profile.

  Quick Look Thumbnails

   Beginning in OS X v10.7, Quick Look provides a simple synchronous
   public method to create a Quick Look thumbnail or icon for a file.

   Quick Look also now provides a public API for the Quick Look Preview
   panel, allowing the developer to display the panel.

   For more information see Quick Look Framework Reference for Mac.

  Store Kit

   The Store Kit framework, previously available in iOS, is now also part
   of OS X. Classes of the Store Kit framework allow you to request
   payment from a user to purchase additional functionality or content
   from the Mac App Store. For more information about Store Kit, read
   In-App Purchase Programming Guide and Store Kit Framework Reference.

BSD And Kernel Features

   The following sections highlight changes to the UNIX/POSIX portions of
   OS X, including command-line functionality and libSystem. They also
   highlight changes to the kernel, device drivers, and kernel extensions.

  64-Bit Kernel Support

   The list of computers that boot K64 by default has grown to include the
   following hardware:
     * Mac Mini (early 2009 and later)
     * MacBook (Aluminum; late 2008 and later)
     * MacBook Air (late 2008 and later)
     * MacBook Pro (mid 2007 and later)
     * iMac (mid 2007 and later)
     * XServe (early 2008 and later)

  Folder Permissions and Ownership

   A number of folders in the System and Local file system domains now
   have different ownership and permissions. Specifically:
     * Many folders in the System domain that were previously owned by the
       admin group are now owned by the wheel group.
     * Permissions for the root directory (/) are now mode 755 (writable
       only by root) instead of mode 775 (writable by the admin group).
     * Permissions for /Applications/Utilities are now mode 755 (writable
       only by root) instead of mode 775 (writable by the admin group).
     * Permissions for /Library are now mode 755 (writable only by root)
       instead of mode 775 (writable by the admin group), and are no
       longer sticky.
       All subdirectories within /Library now have mode 755 (writable only
       by root) permissions instead of mode 775 (writable by the admin
       group) except:
          + /Library/Caches
          + /Library/Fonts
          + /Library/Java
          + /Library/QuickTimeStreaming
          + /Library/Receipts
          + /Library/Tomcat
       The subdirectories listed above have the same permissions as in
       previous versions of OS X (usually mode 775, sometimes with the
       sticky bit set).
     * Permissions for /Network/Applications and /Network/Library are now
       mode 555 (unwritable even by root) instead of mode 755 (writable
       only by root).
     * Permissions for /var/log/DiagnosticMessages are slightly more lax,
       with mode 770 (writable by the admin group, unreadable by non-admin
       users) instead of mode 750 (writable only by root, unreadable by
       non-admin users).

  FileVault

   In OS X v10.7, FileVault provides built-in support for encrypted root
   volumes. When you enable encryption, the system’s root volume is
   encrypted in the background and you can continue to use the system
   normally. Once encryption is enabled, on reboot or wake from sleep, you
   must log in before you can access any data on the drive.

   Although this feature has limited developer impact (there is no public
   API for the underlying storage system), there are two things to notice:
     * Assumptions that “boot = root” are much more likely to be wrong.
       (You should be allowing OS X to handle KEXT caches, so in general,
       this change should not cause problems.)
     * The OS X UI may disallow enabling encryption if you have a
       particularly exotic driver stack. For example, if it is not
       possible to map a volume-relative block number to a physical block
       number.

   IT developers should also be aware that the FileVault UI is disabled.

   In general, if your driver worked correctly with AppleRAID in previous
   versions of OS X, it should also work correctly with Core Storage.

  I/O Kit–launchd Integration

   Beginning in OS X v10.7, you can use launchd to automatically launch an
   app whenever a specific device is detected by I/O Kit.

   To use this feature, add a property list file to the
   /Library/LaunchAgents folder. The property list has the standard
   structure of a launchd property list file (see launchd.plist), with one
   additional item: an I/O Kit matching dictionary.
   ../Art/matchingpluginplist.png

   The I/O Kit matching dictionary contains a separate dictionary for each
   distinct device that you want associated with your app. Each of these
   device dictionaries should provide the product number, vendor number,
   and provider class for its device.

   The I/O Kit matching plug-in watches for IOService objects that match
   any of the device dictionaries you provide and launches your app when
   at least one is detected. If your app terminates when there is at least
   one matching IOService object, the I/O Kit matching plug-in relaunches
   it automatically.

   Although your app is automatically launched when a corresponding device
   is detected, it is not automatically terminated when a device is
   removed. Therefore, you should configure your app to listen for
   notifications and respond appropriately when a device is removed. See
   the USBPrivateDataSample sample code for more information.

   If your app is already running when a corresponding device is attached,
   no action is taken.

  In-Kernel Video Capture

   OS X v10.7 provides a new kernel-level programming interface for
   writing video capture device drivers, I/O Video, that is intended to
   replace the QuickTime sequence grabber API as the primary means of
   getting video into OS X.

   I/O Video consists of (1) the IOVideoDevice class on the kernel side
   (along with various related minor classes) that your actual driver
   should subclass and (2) a user space device interface for communicating
   with the driver.

   For more information, see the header file in the Kernel framework.

App Features

   The following sections highlight changes to the behavior of built-in
   apps such as the Finder and Safari.

  Safari

    New Process Architecture

   Beginning in OS X v10.7, Safari includes a new process architecture
   that separates its rendering process from its app process. As a result,
   Safari is more responsive, stable, and secure.

    Plug-in Support in Safari

   In Safari on OS X v10.7, all browser plug-ins run in their own process,
   improving browser stability and security. Netscape plug-ins continue to
   work in Safari with no modification. However, Safari does not support
   WebKit plug-ins. The WebKit plug-in API is not compatible with this new
   process architecture and is being deprecated. Plug-in developers
   currently using the WebKit plug-in API should adopt the Netscape
   plug-in API in order to be compatible with Safari on OS X v10.7. You
   can find the documentation at WebKit Plug-In Programming Topics.

   Note: Some WebKit plug-ins can also be replaced by Safari Extensions.
   To learn about Safari Extensions, read Safari Extensions Development
   Guide in the Safari Reference Library.

    Full Screen API

   The WebKit framework’s Element and Document classes now provide methods
   to enable full-screen mode for web content and to control keyboard
   behavior while in full-screen mode.

  The Finder

   In OS X v10.7, the following files and folders are now hidden:
     * /lost+found
     * $HOME/Library

OS X Server

   The following sections highlight changes to OS X Server.

  Database Server Replacement

   Beginning in OS X v10.7, OS X Server ships with PostgreSQL as its
   database server instead of MySQL. If you are using other software that
   requires MySQL, you must install it yourself.

   You can find downloads and installation instructions for MySQL at the
   MySQL Community Edition site, http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/.

   In addition to the directions linked to above, you must manually
   reconfigure PHP if you use it to work with MySQL databases. Previous
   versions of PHP obtained their default values for mysql.default_port
   and mysql.default_socket from the mysql-config command-line tool.
   Because this tool is no longer available, you must explicitly define
   these values in /etc/php.ini.

   The default port for MySQL is traditionally 3306, and the traditional
   socket on OS X was /var/mysql/mysql.sock. For more information about
   the available directives, see
   http://us3.php.net/manual/en/mysql.configuration.php.

  Profile Management

   OS X now supports configuration profiles similar to those on iOS-based
   devices. As part of this functionality, OS X Server provides a full
   mobile-device-management (MDM) server. This configuration service
   provides you with the ability to administer both OS X clients and iOS
   clients.

   To enable the MDM server, launch Server Center and enable the Device
   Config service. Then manage devices using the device-configuration web
   interface. There is no need to use the iPhone Configuration Utility
   when working with this service.

   Although iOS configuration profiles are mostly compatible with OS X
   clients, there are some minor differences. Specifically, Exchange
   accounts behave differently because iOS uses ActiveSync whereas OS X
   uses Exchange Web Services. Also, the following features are not
   currently supported in OS X:
     * Certain advanced network settings, such as GPRS
     * Passcode policies
     * Calendar subscriptions (iCal)
     * The Clear Passcode command
     * Find My Mac

   As with iOS mobile device management, all managed computers must be
   able to reach the Apple Push Notification servers in order to receive
   push notifications.
