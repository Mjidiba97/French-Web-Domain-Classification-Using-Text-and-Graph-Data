How Trump's wall is affecting those at the borders

   The first in a series travelling along the US-Mexico border, talking to
   those who might be affected by Trump's wall.
   Massoud Hayoun by Massoud Hayoun
   02 Mar 2017 15:30 GMT

Story highlights

     * US and Mexico share a 1,954-mile border (3,142km)
     * President Trump has said his wall will cover 1,000 miles (1,609 km)
     * It has been estimated that the wall will be complete by the end of
       2020

   Tijuana, Mexico - Alfredo lives in a shelter for deportees on Tijuana
   Beach, a stone's throw from the border wall that bars him from the
   United States. That wall - not to be confused with the bigger one US
   President Donald Trump plans to build - has existed for decades.

   Alfredo's is among the most physically emblematic of these shelters.
   There are many others. In fact, there are more shelters and migrants
   here than ever, since Trump launched his campaign to keep Mexicans and
   other immigrants out of the US, activists say.

   The shelters are struggling to cope with what people familiar with the
   border-crossing industry - people-smugglers known here as "coyotes" -
   tell Al Jazeera is a wave of migrants and deportees coming to and from
   the US since Trump made calls to heighten deportations of undocumented
   people and signed an executive order calling to build the newer,
   stronger border wall.
   [afd55298754a46a0b7813dca3078bec0_6.jpg]

   The new wall won't do much to keep people out; many here say with
   confidence and often a cheeky sense of humour. Still, its imminent
   construction is taken as a sign that people who have acted as a driving
   force of the American economy - not just Mexican Americans but
   immigrants generally - are no longer welcome there.

   "America was built with Mexican hands," Alfredo says in a low, sober
   voice. He emphasised to Al Jazeera that this is what he wanted to tell
   English-language readers around the world.

   After six years as a construction worker in the southern US state of
   Mississippi, immigration officials rounded up Alfredo and several other
   undocumented American workers and deported them to Mexico. "Instead of
   at least treating us as humans, we are treated as animals. For them, we
   are animals," he says.

'We're family, we're brothers'

   In a small shack crammed with around 30 deportees originally from
   Mexico and El Salvador, Alfredo, 54, who asked to go only by his first
   name out of a mistrust of authorities common among deportees, spoke to
   Al Jazeera in the dark, his face obscured in a lampless, unheated
   sleeping area. Gusts of wind burst through a broken window as he spoke,
   holding back a severe cough shared by his roommates.
   [6d04671e28cc44deab3c21e8e04d2ca7_6.jpg]

   For Alfredo, whose struggle to earn a livelihood has taken him
   thousands of miles from his native Mexico City, he hopes his last stop
   will be this dilapidated shelter - his thin mat bedding among many on a
   cold asphalt floor under a crumbling roof.

   He won't make the dangerous, gruelling trek to the US again, he says.
   He's one of many migrants in Tijuana without dreams of America, but
   there are many more who do, in these shelters - packed with new
   deportees and migrants hoping to make it to the US before Trump
   tightens controls of what continues to be a porous border.

   In the next room, Ramon, one of the co-organisers of the shelter, has
   fallen severely ill with a flu. He also suffers from what his roommates
   describe as a mysterious limpness in one leg.

   His friends have prepared him a tonic - a broth with cinnamon. The warm
   smell perfumes the shack, the size of some walk-in closets just
   opposite the border.

   "We are a family. We are brothers," Alfredo explains. Like many US
   migrant workers struggling to survive, Alfredo has no wife or children.
   After years of building in the US, which he says he still "respects",
   he says the real separation between the US and Mexico is "we have love
   for human beings here. It doesn't matter your colour or religion -
   Catholic or not. We help how we can, even though we aren't a rich
   country. Because we know we might be the ones suffering tomorrow."

   Tijuana's people are scrambling to meet new challenges posed by Trump's
   plans to bolster the existing border walls with a larger wall and also
   to drastically ramp up deportations of undocumented Americans. Many
   come from across Mexico and Central America but also faraway Haiti and
   even Africa. They have rushed to Tijuana and other Mexican border
   cities, attempting to pay the coyotes thousands of dollars to smuggle
   them across. Activists also complain of a heightened rash of
   deportations since Trump's inauguration.

   As Trump seeks to tighten borders and increase deportation, more and
   more migrants hoping to reach the US have found themselves blocked at
   the border

   Al Jazeera counted at least 30 shelters for migrants in Tijuana; some
   are shacks, others are spare rooms in private homes or repurposed
   churches. Most house migrants free of charge - some charge 20 Mexican
   pesos, about $1, a day to cover maintenance. Of those,19 have opened in
   the past seven months, according to Hugo Castro, director of Angeles de
   la Frontera (Border Angels), an organisation dedicated to helping
   deliver resources to and raising awareness of migrants attempting to
   enter or who have been deported from the US.

   Non-migrant Tijuana residents have noticed a significant change in
   their city's make-up in recent months. "There are many more people
   suffering here than even before," said Rosario Corona, 19, at the
   city's signature cathedral Nuestra Senora de Guadelupe (Our Lady of
   Guadalupe). Corona works with a church youth group that administers aid
   to migrants and others in need.

   Corona waits in a line at the cathedral for a priest to administer the
   Catholic sacrament confession, where one seeks absolution for sins. She
   is flanked in the pews by migrants, some of whom sit in church not only
   for prayer but for lack of anywhere else to go. One tells Al Jazeera
   that he's going to enter the confession booth not to ask the priest for
   forgiveness but for charity. Moments later, he leaves empty-handed -
   with so many in this city in need, it remains unclear whether he got
   what he came for.

   "Unity and respect is what makes a place strong," says Liliana Vasquez,
   26, one of Corona's fellow youth group workers, as their group leaves
   the church.

   The sudden surge in the number of shelters and the influx of new
   migrants that prompted it, Castro says, happened amid mounting fears
   that Trump might win and make good on promises to build a wall and ramp
   up deportations.

'... Some I assume are good people'

   It began in June 2015, when Trump launched his presidential election
   campaign with a speech that bewildered many across the US-Mexico border
   and around the world: "When Mexico sends its people, they're not
   sending their best," he said.

   "They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're
   bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're
   bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."

   For many in Tijuana, these words hit a nerve. Susan Smith, 61, is a
   non-Latina US-born social justice and anti-nuclear-proliferation
   activist, born on the US border with Mexico in the state of New Mexico.
   She identifies as Mexican, not by birth or ethnicity, but by life
   experience and family. Her husband, child and grandchild are ethnically
   Mexican, and she lives in Tijuana's Playas or Beach neighbourhood - not
   far from Alfredo's shelter.

   For her, Trump's words about Mexicans are "slightly moderated hate
   speech, designed to turn a whole swath of humanity into caricatures
   from a Clint Eastwood movie, isn't it? All about the drama and
   soundbite, poisonous metaphors - messages of mass destruction."

   In July 2015, Trump made a brief visit to a US border town with Mexico
   - Laredo, Texas - where he reiterated promises to crack down on
   migrants.

   In mid-2016, Castro says, migrants began to realise that Trump might
   beat his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The migrants flocked to
   border towns, particularly Tijuana.

   On January 25, the freshly inaugurated president finally signed the
   executive order allowing for the creation of the wall - who will pay
   for the wall remains uncertain, despite Trump's insistence that Mexico
   will.

   Mexican officials have scoffed at that assertion. And then in early
   February, the Los Angeles Times newspaper reported, citing calculations
   of presidential directives, that Trump would deport as many as eight
   million undocumented Americans.

   Trump has that said he "wasn't kidding" about the border, telling the
   press that it was "being designed".

   But just hours earlier, across the US border in San Diego, a US Customs
   and Border Patrol (CBP) officer, who spoke without offering his name or
   being recorded because the officer was not authorised to speak to the
   press, joked that there was already a wall and said that the new one
   "will change nothing".

   CBP declined to respond to a request for comment on the wall and
   deportations - specifically criticism of the project's efficacy and
   potential impact on the communities it affects, saying that such
   questions are "speculative".

   The CBP press team also directed Al Jazeera to the Trump administration
   for further comment as well as the original executive order signed in
   January for more information.

   Trump's press team did not respond to an interview request from Al
   Jazeera. The Trump administration has repeatedly expressed disdain for
   media coverage that it complains is unflattering, provoking the ire of
   free press and US constitutional rights advocates.

'It's a war against international migrants'

   Among the criticisms of the wall and deportations are signs that they
   may actually hurt the US economy. Undocumented Americans contribute
   $11.64bn to the US economy in taxes annually, according to a February
   2016 study from US think-tank the Institute on Taxation and Economic
   Policy. But with Trump's promises to expel them, the burden is also
   strongly felt beyond the US border, in Mexico.

   "Trump is creating a humanitarian crisis" in Tijuana, Castro said.

   "He's a war criminal of a war that hasn't been declared. It's not a war
   against a country. It's a war against international migrants from
   Somalia, Mexico, Central America, Iraq, from all the world. The
   migrants are suffering, the risk of dying [in transit] has increased."

   Castro visits about five shelters a day with donations of food and
   cash, he says. A dual citizen with the US, he often visits universities
   there to explain the issues faced by migrants. He raises funds on
   Border Angels' website. But with so many newcomers to feed, he says
   resources are drying up faster than ever. "Money just evaporates,"
   Castro said.

   With the new pressure put on Tijuana's city infrastructure and a
   network of philanthropists rushing to house a surge in workers from
   around the country and world, Alfredo "thanks God" he lives in his
   overcrowded shelter, which in recent weeks has had new arrivals -
   freshly deported from the US, where their families - in one case a
   newborn baby - are left behind without a father.

   Some migrants don't have shelter at all, Alfredo says. Many migrants
   are crowding the streets - particularly in Tijuana's Zona Norte
   (Northern Zone) - infamous for rampant drug trafficking and other
   crimes. There, the migrants are in a vulnerable position, Castro says;
   one shelter has in recent months devolved into a crack house, as
   desperation and disillusionment abound.

   At the beach, just outside of Alfredo's shelter, a man sits on a bench
   before what appears to be a door at the wall that remains locked. The
   door is referred to by locals as the "gate of hell". The man sits
   before the "gate" much as one waits for a bus. Like many of the
   migrants wandering the city, he has an overstuffed backpack and a
   listless expression on his face. From there, beyond the grating and
   another series of small walls, the man looks at San Diego kilometres
   away, as dusk turns to night and lights turn on in the cookie-cutter
   high-rise buildings that differentiate the US from this place.

Rohingya repatriation: why the rush?

   Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh should not be forced to return to
   Myanmar until their safety and rights are guaranteed.

   It was a simple question, but 50-year-old Maimuna's eyes filled with
   tears as she contemplated her response. We had been talking for half an
   hour in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, but when I asked if
   she wanted to go home to Myanmar, she began crying quietly into her
   headscarf.

   "I don't know," she said eventually. "It depends on God's will. I
   really want to go back to Myanmar, but only if peace is available
   there."

   Three months on, it looks ever more unlikely that Maimuna will have a
   choice in the matter. Last week, the Bangladesh and Myanmar governments
   furthered their arrangements to return all 650,000 of the Rohingya who
   fled last year's military crackdown within two years. An
   announcement on Monday by Bangladesh that returns will be delayed
   pending further "preparations" was welcome, but the fact remains that
   this arrangement was agreed upon without any consultation with the
   Rohingya themselves.

   While the arrangement acknowledges the legal requirement that returns
   be voluntary and effected in safety and dignity, it is difficult to see
   how this could happen without a total transformation of Myanmar's
   policy towards the Rohingya. The obfuscation and denials of the Myanmar
   military regarding the atrocities it has committed against the Rohingya
   do not inspire confidence that the lot of the Rohingya in Myanmar will
   improve anytime soon. The military has, so far, admitted to killing
   just 10 people out of probable thousands, and still refers to the men,
   women and children killed and tortured in the crackdown as
   "terrorists".

   In all likelihood, returning Rohingya will face the same miserable,
   apartheid conditions that they so recently fled. Specific parts of the
   deal seem to confirm this. For example, it states that the Rohingya's
   freedom of movement will be based on "existing legislation and
   regulations" - in other words, a return to a status quo which
   discriminates against the Rohingya, segregates them in poverty-stricken
   townships and forbids them from travelling.

   This is why it is so important that refugees themselves are given a
   say. On Friday, a group of Rohingya elders in Maimuna's camp showed a
   Reuters reporter a petition they are drafting. It lists the conditions
   they want met before the repatriation process begins, including demands
   that they are granted citizenship and given back the land they used to
   occupy, and that the military is held accountable for the violations
   committed against them. Over the past few days, refugees have organised
   in protest, chanting and holding banners inside the camps demanding
   that their rights and dignity be guaranteed before returns begin. This
   is the kind of input that should be informing returns policy - not
   deadlines.

   Because many Rohingya no longer have homes in Myanmar, the two
   governments have proposed shuttling them between a series of transit
   camps and reception centres. Judging by the fact that some 120,000
   Rohingya have lived in "temporary" displacement camps in Rakhine State
   since 2012, the displacement of those returning will in all likelihood
   be prolonged on the other side of the border.

   So why the rush?

   Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest countries, and the presence of
   an estimated one million Rohingya refugees in the country - the latest
   arrivals joined hundreds of thousands of Rohingya displaced during
   previous crises - has pushed already straining services and
   infrastructure to breaking point. The failure to mitigate this strain
   has been a global one.

   On October 23, last year, a high-level pledging conference in Geneva to
   raise money for the humanitarian response in Bangladesh failed to raise
   the total funds requested. None of the funding that was pledged will go
   to support Bangladesh's infrastructure needs and, in any case, it is
   only designed to cover the most basic needs of the refugees - food and
   shelter - and only for six months. By early spring, Bangladesh will be
   back to square one. Other countries urgently need to commit to
   supporting Bangladesh, financially and otherwise, to continue to host
   those seeking asylum.

   The international community's cold shoulder towards the Rohingya is not
   a new story. In 2015, thousands of Rohingya spent months stranded in
   boats in the Andaman Sea, after being repeatedly rejected by coastal
   authorities in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. Last September, at the
   height of the military crackdown, Australia attempted to bribe Rohingya
   refugees at its detention centre on Manus Island to return to Myanmar.

   The message has been drummed into the Rohingya time and time again, by
   foreign governments as well as their own: They are not wanted. Drafting
   a return deal without any input from the refugees is the latest blow to
   a community that has grown sadly used to having no say in its own
   fate.

   Rohingya refugees have an inalienable right to return to Myanmar. This
   means that any individual who does wish to return under the agreement
   should be able to do so. Bangladesh and Myanmar must facilitate such
   returns, and, once in Myanmar, the authorities are obliged to safeguard
   their human rights. But before any state-sponsored returns begin,
   Myanmar needs to effect a fundamental change in the way it treats the
   Rohingya, dismantle the apartheid system that Rohingya have lived under
   and commit to ensuring accountability for past crimes perpetrated by
   the security forces.

   Until this happens, state-sponsored returns to Myanmar cannot truly be
   considered voluntary. Maimuna summed up this up perfectly, saying
   simply: "If the government doesn't want us in Myanmar, I don't want to
   go there."

Outrage from an African 'shithole' inhabitant

   We should not stay silent about Donald Trump's 'shithole' remarks.
   Netsanet Belay by Netsanet Belay
   12 Jan 2018 19:22 GMT

   Martin Luther King Jr day in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on

   Martin Luther King Jr day in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on

   I heard last night that the president of the United States believes
   that, as an African, I come from a shithole country. Charming.

   Donald Trump - despite his subsequent denials - apparently insisted in
   a White House meeting that people from "shithole" countries, by which
   he means Haiti and the entire continent of Africa, should not be
   encouraged or allowed to come to the United States. Norway is
   apparently still OK for him, so that's a relief.

   (To be honest, I almost feel sorry for Norway. Who would want to be on
   Donald Trump's personal list of most favoured nations?)

   But there's a more serious issue here: how should we react to racist
   statements from the president of the United States in a way that is
   appropriate to the gravity of what he is saying, and the basic
   dignities he seeks to erode?

   In the past year, we have been presented with an ever-growing
   multidecker sandwich of presidential offensiveness - with ingredients
   including Trump lying about the threat climate change poses to
   humanity, describing another country's population as "criminals" and
   conducting diplomacy by threatening to destroy another country while
   boasting about the size of his "nuclear button".

   His latest outburst is in flagrant defiance of values summed up in the
   Statue of Liberty itself. When I last looked, the poem at the foot of
   the statue did not read: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled
   masses yearning to breathe free … except if they come from shithole
   countries."

   His casual dismissal of countries, or even whole continents, shows a
   bottomless, unfathomable disdain for the people of Africa and beyond.

   But we would be losing the argument if we tried to respond to the
   falsity of his claims. Insisting that "Africa is not a shithole" likely
   means you've already been wrong-footed by the president.

   Trump knows that - in the US, as in many places - appealing to the
   lowest common denominator can pay political dividends. True leadership
   is about appealing to the better angels of our nature. The current
   president consciously does the opposite.

   So the real question is: What do we all do next, and how? Governments
   across Africa and around the world continue to remain silent in the
   face of Trump's behaviour due to the residing belief that the US still
   has a leadership role to play.

   There comes a time, however, when we must stand up against hatred and
   discrimination, not least when it emanates from the most powerful
   nation in the world.

   If Trump's government is not ready to stand up for human rights and
   speak up against such hateful statements, at the very least we need to
   see an obvious show of solidarity from governments worldwide - from
   Africa to Norway and elsewhere.

   As this continent's leaders prepare for the African Union summit later
   this month, we as Africans - like everyone else - deserve and expect a
   unified voice of outrage and unequivocal rejection of this blatant
   disregard for our dignity and rights.

The world has abandoned South Sudanese refugees

   Despite receiving only limited funds from international organisations,
   Uganda has given a warm welcome to refugees.

   At just 37 years of age, Joyce has seen it all. She's stared into the
   abyss of human cruelty and lived to tell the story. In September 2016,
   soldiers stormed her home in Kajo Keji, South Sudan, which she shared
   with her husband and their children. They tied her husband's arms
   behind his back and stabbed him multiple times until he lay dead.
   WATCH: South Sudan violence forcing thousands to flee to Uganda (2:48)

   A single mother with nine children to feed, Joyce decided to run away -
   to escape the violence in her native land. So she joined the hundreds
   of thousands of South Sudanese people fleeing southwards to Uganda.

   But although the trek to Uganda by foot has reduced her risk of being
   shot dead or raped by soldiers or rebels, her life is still a painful
   daily struggle. She still lacks basic supplies, including food, water
   or shelter.

   And she's not alone, thousands upon thousands of South Sudanese
   refugees in Uganda - nearly two-thirds of them children - are living in
   despicable conditions due to a shameful failure by the international
   community to fund refugee efforts in Uganda, a country that has
   continued to welcome refugees, despite its limited resources.

   The world's wealthiest countries are not doing enough to support these
   refugees.

   UN funding appeals for refugees remain grossly underfunded, leaving
   millions of refugees in destitute conditions, and dismally few
   resettlement places are being offered, contrary to international
   obligations for responsibility-sharing among states.

   The international community must step up and show its support to Uganda
   and the refugees it has given a warm welcome. Their lives depend on it.


   With more than 900,000 South Sudanese refugees already on its
   territory, and with thousands more arriving each day, Uganda is facing
   one of the world's biggest refugee crises.

   Known and praised for its progressive refugee policy, Uganda has kept
   its doors open to refugees against financial odds, but it is buckling
   under the pressure and needs global support.

   Under this policy, refugees are given pieces of land to live on and
   farm, and have equal access to basic services as citizens, including
   healthcare and education. They also have the right to work and own
   businesses.

   The authorities aim for refugees to be self-sufficient within five
   years - and to no longer have to rely on aid agencies.

   And yet the international community has still failed to provide Uganda
   and its refugees with adequate support. By May 2017, the South Sudan
   Refugee Response Plan for Uganda was only 15 percent funded. In 2016,
   it was funded up to 51.4 percent.

   Not only does this lack of funding risk the sustainability of Uganda's
   progressive refugee policy, it also has a direct and devastating impact
   on refugees' lives.

   REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: Children bearing the brunt of South Sudan refugee
   crisis

   Amnesty International spoke to more than 80 South Sudanese refugees in
   settlements across four districts of northern Uganda, as part of a
   recent report, all of whom gave harrowing accounts of the human rights
   abuses they had fled from, including killings, rape and torture. Some
   of them, like Joyce, saw their loved ones being killed.
   WATCH: Rapid population growth endangers Ugandan economy (2:25)

   But instead of full support to live in dignity in Uganda, they have
   been left struggling to cope. Even the most vulnerable, such as trauma
   victims with urgent mental health needs, have been neglected.

   Over 64 percent of the refugees from South Sudan in Uganda are children
   under the age of 18. Many are at risk and in need of urgent support.

   Yet appeals by the Ugandan government, the United Nations and aid
   agencies have fallen on deaf ears.

   But it is not too late.

   Donor countries, including the United States, the European Union and
   its member states, Australia, Canada, China and Japan, have an
   opportunity to change this tomorrow at the Uganda Solidarity Summit on
   Refugees in Kampala. The international community must step up and show
   its support to Uganda and the refugees it has given a warm welcome.
   Their lives depend on it.

Mexican official: CIA 'manages' drug trade

   Spokesman for Chihuahua state says US agencies don't want to end drug
   trade, a claim denied by other Mexican officials.

   Mexican official: CIA 'manages' drug trade
   The CIA refused to comment directly on the allegations of complicity
   made by a low-level Mexican official [Reuters]

   Juarez, Mexico - The US Central Intelligence Agency and other
   international security forces "don't fight drug traffickers", a
   spokesman for the Chihuahua state government in northern Mexico has
   told Al Jazeera, instead "they try to manage the drug trade".

   Allegations about official complicity in the drug business are nothing
   new when they come from activists, professors, campaigners or even
   former officials. However, an official spokesman for the authorities in
   one of Mexico's most violent states - one which directly borders Texas
   - going on the record with such accusations is unique.

   "It's like pest control companies, they only control," Guillermo
   Terrazas Villanueva, the Chihuahua spokesman, told Al Jazeera last
   month at his office in Juarez. "If you finish off the pests, you are
   out of a job. If they finish the drug business, they finish their
   jobs."

                                               [201262591618218734_20.jpg]

   A spokesman for the CIA in Washington wouldn't comment on the
   accusations directly, instead he referred Al Jazeera to an official
   website.

   Accusations are 'baloney'

   Villanueva is not a high ranking official and his views do not
   represent Mexico's foreign policy establishment. Other more senior
   officials in Chihuahua State, including the mayor of Juarez, dismissed
   the claims as "baloney".

   "I think the CIA and DEA [US Drug Enforcement Agency] are on the same
   side as us in fighting drug gangs," Hector Murguia, the mayor of
   Juarez, told Al Jazeera during an interview inside his SUV. "We have
   excellent collaboration with the US."

   Under the Merida Initiative, the US Congress has approved more than
   $1.4bn in drug war aid for Mexico, providing attack helicopters,
   weapons and training for police and judges.

   More than 55,000 people have died in drug related violence in Mexico
   since December 2006. Privately, residents and officials across Mexico's
   political spectrum often blame the lethal cocktail of US drug
   consumption and the flow of high-powered weapons smuggled south of the
   border for causing much of the carnage.

   Drug war 'illusions'

   Meeting the Juarez cartel

   "The war on drugs is an illusion," Hugo Almada Mireles, professor at
   the Autonomous University of Juarez and author of several books, told
   Al Jazeera. "It's a reason to intervene in Latin America."

   "The CIA wants to control the population; they don't want to stop arms
   trafficking to Mexico, look at [Operation] Fast and Furious,” he said,
   referencing a botched US exercise where automatic weapons were sold to
   criminals in the hope that security forces could trace where the guns
   ended up.

   The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms lost track of 1,700 guns as
   part of the operation, including an AK-47 used in 2010 the murder of
   Brian Terry, a Customs and Border Protection Agent.

   Blaming the gringos for Mexico's problems has been a popular sport
   south of the Rio Grande ever since the Mexican-American war of the
   1840s, when the US conquered most of present day California, Utah,
   Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico from its southern neighbour. But
   operations such as Fast and Furious show that reality can be stranger
   than fiction when it comes to the drug war and relations between the US
   and Mexico. If the case hadn't been proven, the idea that US agents
   were actively putting weapons into the hands of Mexican gangsters would
   sound absurd to many.

   'Conspiracy theories'

   "I think it's easy to become cynical about American and other
   countries' involvement in Latin America around drugs," Kevin Sabet, a
   former senior adviser to the White House on drug control policy, told
   Al Jazeera. "Statements [accusing the CIA of managing the drug trade]
   should be backed up with evidence… I don’t put much stake in it."

   Villanueva's accusations "might be a way to get some attention to his
   region, which is understandable but not productive or grounded in
   reality", Sabet said. "We have sort of 'been there done that' with CIA
   conspiracy theories."

   In 1996, the San Jose Mercury News published Dark Alliance, a series of
   investigative reports linking CIA missions in Nicaragua with the
   explosion of crack cocaine consumption in America's ghettos.

   In order to fund Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's socialist
   government, the CIA partnered with Colombian cartels to move drugs into
   Los Angeles, sending profits back to Central America, the series
   alleged.

   "There is no question in my mind that people affiliated with, or on the
   payroll of, the CIA were involved in drug trafficking," US Senator John
   Kerry said at the time, in response to the series.

   Other newspapers, including the Washington Post and the Los Angeles
   Times, slammed Dark Alliance, and the editor of the Mercury News
   eventually wrote that the paper had over-stated some elements in the
   story and made mistakes in the journalistic process, but that he stood
   by many of the key conclusions.

   Widespread rumours

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/kHqeQ5iaEq8

   US government has neglected border corruption

   "It's true, they want to control it," a mid-level official with the
   Secretariat Gobernacion in Juarez, Mexico's equivalent to the US
   Department of Homeland Security, told Al Jazeera of the CIA and DEA's
   policing of the drug trade. The officer, speaking on the condition of
   anonymity, said he knew the allegations to be correct, based on
   discussions he had with US officials working in Juarez.

   Acceptance of these claims within some elements of Mexico's government
   and security services shows the difficulty in pursuing effective
   international action against the drug trade.

   Jesús Zambada Niebla, a leading trafficker from the Sinaloa cartel
   currently awaiting trial in Chicago, has said he was working for the US
   Drug Enforcement Agency during his days as a trafficker, and was
   promised immunity from prosecution.

   "Under that agreement, the Sinaloa Cartel under the leadership of
   [Jesus Zambada's] father, Ismael Zambada and 'Chapo' Guzmán were given
   carte blanche to continue to smuggle tonnes of illicit drugs... into...
   the United States, and were protected by the United States government
   from arrest and prosecution in return for providing information against
   rival cartels," Zambada's lawyers wrote as part of his defence.
   "Indeed, the Unites States government agents aided the leaders of the
   Sinaloa Cartel."

   The Sinaloa cartel is Mexico's oldest and most powerful trafficking
   organisation, and some analysts believe security forces in the US and
   Mexico favour the group over its rivals.

   Joaquin "El Chapo", the cartel's billionaire leader and one of the
   world's most wanted men, escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 by
   sneaking into a laundry truck - likely with collaboration from guards -
   further stoking rumours that leading traffickers have complicit friends
   in high places.

   "It would be easy for the Mexican army to capture El Chapo," Mireles
   said. "But this is not the objective." He thinks the authorities on
   both sides of the border are happy to have El Chapo on the loose, as
   his cartel is easier to manage and his drug money is recycled back into
   the broader economy. Other analysts consider this viewpoint a
   conspiracy theory and blame ineptitude and low level corruption for El
   Chapo's escape, rather than a broader plan from government agencies.

   Political changes

                                                                  In Depth

   After an election hit by reported irregularities, Enrique Pena Nieto
   from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) is set to be sworn in
   as Mexico's president on December 1.

   He wants to open a high-level dialogue with the US about the drug war,
   but has said legalisation of some drugs is not an option. Some
   hardliners in the US worry that Nieto will make a deal with some
   cartels, in order to reduce violence.

   "I am hopeful that he will not return to the PRI party of the past
   which was corrupt and had a history of turning a blind eye to the drug
   cartels," said Michael McCaul, a Republican Congressman from Texas.

   Regardless of what position a new administration takes in order to calm
   the violence and restore order, it is likely many Mexicans - including
   government officials such as Chihuahua spokesman Guillermo Villanueva -
   will believe outside forces want the drug trade to continue.

   The widespread view linking the CIA to the drug trade - whether or not
   the allegations are true - speaks volumes about officials' mutual
   mistrust amid ongoing killings and the destruction of civic life in
   Mexico.

   "We have good soldiers and policemen," Villanueva said. "But you won't
   resolve this problem with bullets. We need education and jobs."

How Trump's wall is affecting those at the borders

   The first in a series travelling along the US-Mexico border, talking to
   those who might be affected by Trump's wall.
   Massoud Hayoun by Massoud Hayoun
   02 Mar 2017 15:30 GMT

Story highlights

     * US and Mexico share a 1,954-mile border (3,142km)
     * President Trump has said his wall will cover 1,000 miles (1,609 km)
     * It has been estimated that the wall will be complete by the end of
       2020

   Tijuana, Mexico - Alfredo lives in a shelter for deportees on Tijuana
   Beach, a stone's throw from the border wall that bars him from the
   United States. That wall - not to be confused with the bigger one US
   President Donald Trump plans to build - has existed for decades.

   Alfredo's is among the most physically emblematic of these shelters.
   There are many others. In fact, there are more shelters and migrants
   here than ever, since Trump launched his campaign to keep Mexicans and
   other immigrants out of the US, activists say.

   The shelters are struggling to cope with what people familiar with the
   border-crossing industry - people-smugglers known here as "coyotes" -
   tell Al Jazeera is a wave of migrants and deportees coming to and from
   the US since Trump made calls to heighten deportations of undocumented
   people and signed an executive order calling to build the newer,
   stronger border wall.
   [afd55298754a46a0b7813dca3078bec0_6.jpg]

   The new wall won't do much to keep people out; many here say with
   confidence and often a cheeky sense of humour. Still, its imminent
   construction is taken as a sign that people who have acted as a driving
   force of the American economy - not just Mexican Americans but
   immigrants generally - are no longer welcome there.

   "America was built with Mexican hands," Alfredo says in a low, sober
   voice. He emphasised to Al Jazeera that this is what he wanted to tell
   English-language readers around the world.

   After six years as a construction worker in the southern US state of
   Mississippi, immigration officials rounded up Alfredo and several other
   undocumented American workers and deported them to Mexico. "Instead of
   at least treating us as humans, we are treated as animals. For them, we
   are animals," he says.

'We're family, we're brothers'

   In a small shack crammed with around 30 deportees originally from
   Mexico and El Salvador, Alfredo, 54, who asked to go only by his first
   name out of a mistrust of authorities common among deportees, spoke to
   Al Jazeera in the dark, his face obscured in a lampless, unheated
   sleeping area. Gusts of wind burst through a broken window as he spoke,
   holding back a severe cough shared by his roommates.
   [6d04671e28cc44deab3c21e8e04d2ca7_6.jpg]

   For Alfredo, whose struggle to earn a livelihood has taken him
   thousands of miles from his native Mexico City, he hopes his last stop
   will be this dilapidated shelter - his thin mat bedding among many on a
   cold asphalt floor under a crumbling roof.

   He won't make the dangerous, gruelling trek to the US again, he says.
   He's one of many migrants in Tijuana without dreams of America, but
   there are many more who do, in these shelters - packed with new
   deportees and migrants hoping to make it to the US before Trump
   tightens controls of what continues to be a porous border.

   In the next room, Ramon, one of the co-organisers of the shelter, has
   fallen severely ill with a flu. He also suffers from what his roommates
   describe as a mysterious limpness in one leg.

   His friends have prepared him a tonic - a broth with cinnamon. The warm
   smell perfumes the shack, the size of some walk-in closets just
   opposite the border.

   "We are a family. We are brothers," Alfredo explains. Like many US
   migrant workers struggling to survive, Alfredo has no wife or children.
   After years of building in the US, which he says he still "respects",
   he says the real separation between the US and Mexico is "we have love
   for human beings here. It doesn't matter your colour or religion -
   Catholic or not. We help how we can, even though we aren't a rich
   country. Because we know we might be the ones suffering tomorrow."

   Tijuana's people are scrambling to meet new challenges posed by Trump's
   plans to bolster the existing border walls with a larger wall and also
   to drastically ramp up deportations of undocumented Americans. Many
   come from across Mexico and Central America but also faraway Haiti and
   even Africa. They have rushed to Tijuana and other Mexican border
   cities, attempting to pay the coyotes thousands of dollars to smuggle
   them across. Activists also complain of a heightened rash of
   deportations since Trump's inauguration.

   As Trump seeks to tighten borders and increase deportation, more and
   more migrants hoping to reach the US have found themselves blocked at
   the border

   Al Jazeera counted at least 30 shelters for migrants in Tijuana; some
   are shacks, others are spare rooms in private homes or repurposed
   churches. Most house migrants free of charge - some charge 20 Mexican
   pesos, about $1, a day to cover maintenance. Of those,19 have opened in
   the past seven months, according to Hugo Castro, director of Angeles de
   la Frontera (Border Angels), an organisation dedicated to helping
   deliver resources to and raising awareness of migrants attempting to
   enter or who have been deported from the US.

   Non-migrant Tijuana residents have noticed a significant change in
   their city's make-up in recent months. "There are many more people
   suffering here than even before," said Rosario Corona, 19, at the
   city's signature cathedral Nuestra Senora de Guadelupe (Our Lady of
   Guadalupe). Corona works with a church youth group that administers aid
   to migrants and others in need.

   Corona waits in a line at the cathedral for a priest to administer the
   Catholic sacrament confession, where one seeks absolution for sins. She
   is flanked in the pews by migrants, some of whom sit in church not only
   for prayer but for lack of anywhere else to go. One tells Al Jazeera
   that he's going to enter the confession booth not to ask the priest for
   forgiveness but for charity. Moments later, he leaves empty-handed -
   with so many in this city in need, it remains unclear whether he got
   what he came for.

   "Unity and respect is what makes a place strong," says Liliana Vasquez,
   26, one of Corona's fellow youth group workers, as their group leaves
   the church.

   The sudden surge in the number of shelters and the influx of new
   migrants that prompted it, Castro says, happened amid mounting fears
   that Trump might win and make good on promises to build a wall and ramp
   up deportations.

'... Some I assume are good people'

   It began in June 2015, when Trump launched his presidential election
   campaign with a speech that bewildered many across the US-Mexico border
   and around the world: "When Mexico sends its people, they're not
   sending their best," he said.

   "They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're
   bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're
   bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."

   For many in Tijuana, these words hit a nerve. Susan Smith, 61, is a
   non-Latina US-born social justice and anti-nuclear-proliferation
   activist, born on the US border with Mexico in the state of New Mexico.
   She identifies as Mexican, not by birth or ethnicity, but by life
   experience and family. Her husband, child and grandchild are ethnically
   Mexican, and she lives in Tijuana's Playas or Beach neighbourhood - not
   far from Alfredo's shelter.

   For her, Trump's words about Mexicans are "slightly moderated hate
   speech, designed to turn a whole swath of humanity into caricatures
   from a Clint Eastwood movie, isn't it? All about the drama and
   soundbite, poisonous metaphors - messages of mass destruction."

   In July 2015, Trump made a brief visit to a US border town with Mexico
   - Laredo, Texas - where he reiterated promises to crack down on
   migrants.

   In mid-2016, Castro says, migrants began to realise that Trump might
   beat his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The migrants flocked to
   border towns, particularly Tijuana.

   On January 25, the freshly inaugurated president finally signed the
   executive order allowing for the creation of the wall - who will pay
   for the wall remains uncertain, despite Trump's insistence that Mexico
   will.

   Mexican officials have scoffed at that assertion. And then in early
   February, the Los Angeles Times newspaper reported, citing calculations
   of presidential directives, that Trump would deport as many as eight
   million undocumented Americans.

   Trump has that said he "wasn't kidding" about the border, telling the
   press that it was "being designed".

   But just hours earlier, across the US border in San Diego, a US Customs
   and Border Patrol (CBP) officer, who spoke without offering his name or
   being recorded because the officer was not authorised to speak to the
   press, joked that there was already a wall and said that the new one
   "will change nothing".

   CBP declined to respond to a request for comment on the wall and
   deportations - specifically criticism of the project's efficacy and
   potential impact on the communities it affects, saying that such
   questions are "speculative".

   The CBP press team also directed Al Jazeera to the Trump administration
   for further comment as well as the original executive order signed in
   January for more information.

   Trump's press team did not respond to an interview request from Al
   Jazeera. The Trump administration has repeatedly expressed disdain for
   media coverage that it complains is unflattering, provoking the ire of
   free press and US constitutional rights advocates.

'It's a war against international migrants'

   Among the criticisms of the wall and deportations are signs that they
   may actually hurt the US economy. Undocumented Americans contribute
   $11.64bn to the US economy in taxes annually, according to a February
   2016 study from US think-tank the Institute on Taxation and Economic
   Policy. But with Trump's promises to expel them, the burden is also
   strongly felt beyond the US border, in Mexico.

   "Trump is creating a humanitarian crisis" in Tijuana, Castro said.

   "He's a war criminal of a war that hasn't been declared. It's not a war
   against a country. It's a war against international migrants from
   Somalia, Mexico, Central America, Iraq, from all the world. The
   migrants are suffering, the risk of dying [in transit] has increased."

   Castro visits about five shelters a day with donations of food and
   cash, he says. A dual citizen with the US, he often visits universities
   there to explain the issues faced by migrants. He raises funds on
   Border Angels' website. But with so many newcomers to feed, he says
   resources are drying up faster than ever. "Money just evaporates,"
   Castro said.

   With the new pressure put on Tijuana's city infrastructure and a
   network of philanthropists rushing to house a surge in workers from
   around the country and world, Alfredo "thanks God" he lives in his
   overcrowded shelter, which in recent weeks has had new arrivals -
   freshly deported from the US, where their families - in one case a
   newborn baby - are left behind without a father.

   Some migrants don't have shelter at all, Alfredo says. Many migrants
   are crowding the streets - particularly in Tijuana's Zona Norte
   (Northern Zone) - infamous for rampant drug trafficking and other
   crimes. There, the migrants are in a vulnerable position, Castro says;
   one shelter has in recent months devolved into a crack house, as
   desperation and disillusionment abound.

   At the beach, just outside of Alfredo's shelter, a man sits on a bench
   before what appears to be a door at the wall that remains locked. The
   door is referred to by locals as the "gate of hell". The man sits
   before the "gate" much as one waits for a bus. Like many of the
   migrants wandering the city, he has an overstuffed backpack and a
   listless expression on his face. From there, beyond the grating and
   another series of small walls, the man looks at San Diego kilometres
   away, as dusk turns to night and lights turn on in the cookie-cutter
   high-rise buildings that differentiate the US from this place.

Rohingya repatriation: why the rush?

   Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh should not be forced to return to
   Myanmar until their safety and rights are guaranteed.

   Hossain/Reuters]

   It was a simple question, but 50-year-old Maimuna's eyes filled with
   tears as she contemplated her response. We had been talking for half an
   hour in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, but when I asked if
   she wanted to go home to Myanmar, she began crying quietly into her
   headscarf.

   "I don't know," she said eventually. "It depends on God's will. I
   really want to go back to Myanmar, but only if peace is available
   there."

   Three months on, it looks ever more unlikely that Maimuna will have a
   choice in the matter. Last week, the Bangladesh and Myanmar governments
   furthered their arrangements to return all 650,000 of the Rohingya who
   fled last year's military crackdown within two years. An
   announcement on Monday by Bangladesh that returns will be delayed
   pending further "preparations" was welcome, but the fact remains that
   this arrangement was agreed upon without any consultation with the
   Rohingya themselves.

   While the arrangement acknowledges the legal requirement that returns
   be voluntary and effected in safety and dignity, it is difficult to see
   how this could happen without a total transformation of Myanmar's
   policy towards the Rohingya. The obfuscation and denials of the Myanmar
   military regarding the atrocities it has committed against the Rohingya
   do not inspire confidence that the lot of the Rohingya in Myanmar will
   improve anytime soon. The military has, so far, admitted to killing
   just 10 people out of probable thousands, and still refers to the men,
   women and children killed and tortured in the crackdown as
   "terrorists".

   In all likelihood, returning Rohingya will face the same miserable,
   apartheid conditions that they so recently fled. Specific parts of the
   deal seem to confirm this. For example, it states that the Rohingya's
   freedom of movement will be based on "existing legislation and
   regulations" - in other words, a return to a status quo which
   discriminates against the Rohingya, segregates them in poverty-stricken
   townships and forbids them from travelling.

   This is why it is so important that refugees themselves are given a
   say. On Friday, a group of Rohingya elders in Maimuna's camp showed a
   Reuters reporter a petition they are drafting. It lists the conditions
   they want met before the repatriation process begins, including demands
   that they are granted citizenship and given back the land they used to
   occupy, and that the military is held accountable for the violations
   committed against them. Over the past few days, refugees have organised
   in protest, chanting and holding banners inside the camps demanding
   that their rights and dignity be guaranteed before returns begin. This
   is the kind of input that should be informing returns policy - not
   deadlines.

   Because many Rohingya no longer have homes in Myanmar, the two
   governments have proposed shuttling them between a series of transit
   camps and reception centres. Judging by the fact that some 120,000
   Rohingya have lived in "temporary" displacement camps in Rakhine State
   since 2012, the displacement of those returning will in all likelihood
   be prolonged on the other side of the border.

   So why the rush?

   Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest countries, and the presence of
   an estimated one million Rohingya refugees in the country - the latest
   arrivals joined hundreds of thousands of Rohingya displaced during
   previous crises - has pushed already straining services and
   infrastructure to breaking point. The failure to mitigate this strain
   has been a global one.

   On October 23, last year, a high-level pledging conference in Geneva to
   raise money for the humanitarian response in Bangladesh failed to raise
   the total funds requested. None of the funding that was pledged will go
   to support Bangladesh's infrastructure needs and, in any case, it is
   only designed to cover the most basic needs of the refugees - food and
   shelter - and only for six months. By early spring, Bangladesh will be
   back to square one. Other countries urgently need to commit to
   supporting Bangladesh, financially and otherwise, to continue to host
   those seeking asylum.

   The international community's cold shoulder towards the Rohingya is not
   a new story. In 2015, thousands of Rohingya spent months stranded in
   boats in the Andaman Sea, after being repeatedly rejected by coastal
   authorities in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. Last September, at the
   height of the military crackdown, Australia attempted to bribe Rohingya
   refugees at its detention centre on Manus Island to return to Myanmar.

   The message has been drummed into the Rohingya time and time again, by
   foreign governments as well as their own: They are not wanted. Drafting
   a return deal without any input from the refugees is the latest blow to
   a community that has grown sadly used to having no say in its own
   fate.

   Rohingya refugees have an inalienable right to return to Myanmar. This
   means that any individual who does wish to return under the agreement
   should be able to do so. Bangladesh and Myanmar must facilitate such
   returns, and, once in Myanmar, the authorities are obliged to safeguard
   their human rights. But before any state-sponsored returns begin,
   Myanmar needs to effect a fundamental change in the way it treats the
   Rohingya, dismantle the apartheid system that Rohingya have lived under
   and commit to ensuring accountability for past crimes perpetrated by
   the security forces.

   Until this happens, state-sponsored returns to Myanmar cannot truly be
   considered voluntary. Maimuna summed up this up perfectly, saying
   simply: "If the government doesn't want us in Myanmar, I don't want to
   go there."

   The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not
   necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance.

Outrage from an African 'shithole' inhabitant

   We should not stay silent about Donald Trump's 'shithole' remarks.
   Netsanet Belay by Netsanet Belay
   12 Jan 2018 19:22 GMT

   Martin Luther King Jr day in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on

   US President Donald Trump before signing a proclamation to honour
   Martin Luther King Jr day in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on
   January 12, 2018 [Joshua Roberts/Reuters]

   I heard last night that the president of the United States believes
   that, as an African, I come from a shithole country. Charming.

   Donald Trump - despite his subsequent denials - apparently insisted in
   a White House meeting that people from "shithole" countries, by which
   he means Haiti and the entire continent of Africa, should not be
   encouraged or allowed to come to the United States. Norway is
   apparently still OK for him, so that's a relief.

   (To be honest, I almost feel sorry for Norway. Who would want to be on
   Donald Trump's personal list of most favoured nations?)

   But there's a more serious issue here: how should we react to racist
   statements from the president of the United States in a way that is
   appropriate to the gravity of what he is saying, and the basic
   dignities he seeks to erode?

   In the past year, we have been presented with an ever-growing
   multidecker sandwich of presidential offensiveness - with ingredients
   including Trump lying about the threat climate change poses to
   humanity, describing another country's population as "criminals" and
   conducting diplomacy by threatening to destroy another country while
   boasting about the size of his "nuclear button".

   His latest outburst is in flagrant defiance of values summed up in the
   Statue of Liberty itself. When I last looked, the poem at the foot of
   the statue did not read: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled
   masses yearning to breathe free … except if they come from shithole
   countries."

   His casual dismissal of countries, or even whole continents, shows a
   bottomless, unfathomable disdain for the people of Africa and beyond.

   But we would be losing the argument if we tried to respond to the
   falsity of his claims. Insisting that "Africa is not a shithole" likely
   means you've already been wrong-footed by the president.

   Trump knows that - in the US, as in many places - appealing to the
   lowest common denominator can pay political dividends. True leadership
   is about appealing to the better angels of our nature. The current
   president consciously does the opposite.

   So the real question is: What do we all do next, and how? Governments
   across Africa and around the world continue to remain silent in the
   face of Trump's behaviour due to the residing belief that the US still
   has a leadership role to play.

   There comes a time, however, when we must stand up against hatred and
   discrimination, not least when it emanates from the most powerful
   nation in the world.

   If Trump's government is not ready to stand up for human rights and
   speak up against such hateful statements, at the very least we need to
   see an obvious show of solidarity from governments worldwide - from
   Africa to Norway and elsewhere.

   As this continent's leaders prepare for the African Union summit later
   this month, we as Africans - like everyone else - deserve and expect a
   unified voice of outrage and unequivocal rejection of this blatant
   disregard for our dignity and rights.

The world has abandoned South Sudanese refugees

   Despite receiving only limited funds from international organisations,
   Uganda has given a warm welcome to refugees.

   At just 37 years of age, Joyce has seen it all. She's stared into the
   abyss of human cruelty and lived to tell the story. In September 2016,
   soldiers stormed her home in Kajo Keji, South Sudan, which she shared
   with her husband and their children. They tied her husband's arms
   behind his back and stabbed him multiple times until he lay dead.

   A single mother with nine children to feed, Joyce decided to run away -
   to escape the violence in her native land. So she joined the hundreds
   of thousands of South Sudanese people fleeing southwards to Uganda.

   But although the trek to Uganda by foot has reduced her risk of being
   shot dead or raped by soldiers or rebels, her life is still a painful
   daily struggle. She still lacks basic supplies, including food, water
   or shelter.

   And she's not alone, thousands upon thousands of South Sudanese
   refugees in Uganda - nearly two-thirds of them children - are living in
   despicable conditions due to a shameful failure by the international
   community to fund refugee efforts in Uganda, a country that has
   continued to welcome refugees, despite its limited resources.

   The world's wealthiest countries are not doing enough to support these
   refugees.

   UN funding appeals for refugees remain grossly underfunded, leaving
   millions of refugees in destitute conditions, and dismally few
   resettlement places are being offered, contrary to international
   obligations for responsibility-sharing among states.

   The international community must step up and show its support to Uganda
   and the refugees it has given a warm welcome. Their lives depend on it.


   With more than 900,000 South Sudanese refugees already on its
   territory, and with thousands more arriving each day, Uganda is facing
   one of the world's biggest refugee crises.

   Known and praised for its progressive refugee policy, Uganda has kept
   its doors open to refugees against financial odds, but it is buckling
   under the pressure and needs global support.

   Under this policy, refugees are given pieces of land to live on and
   farm, and have equal access to basic services as citizens, including
   healthcare and education. They also have the right to work and own
   businesses.

   The authorities aim for refugees to be self-sufficient within five
   years - and to no longer have to rely on aid agencies.

   And yet the international community has still failed to provide Uganda
   and its refugees with adequate support. By May 2017, the South Sudan
   Refugee Response Plan for Uganda was only 15 percent funded. In 2016,
   it was funded up to 51.4 percent.

   Not only does this lack of funding risk the sustainability of Uganda's
   progressive refugee policy, it also has a direct and devastating impact
   on refugees' lives.

   REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: Children bearing the brunt of South Sudan refugee
   crisis

   Amnesty International spoke to more than 80 South Sudanese refugees in
   settlements across four districts of northern Uganda, as part of a
   recent report, all of whom gave harrowing accounts of the human rights
   abuses they had fled from, including killings, rape and torture. Some
   of them, like Joyce, saw their loved ones being killed.

   But instead of full support to live in dignity in Uganda, they have
   been left struggling to cope. Even the most vulnerable, such as trauma
   victims with urgent mental health needs, have been neglected.

   Over 64 percent of the refugees from South Sudan in Uganda are children
   under the age of 18. Many are at risk and in need of urgent support.

   Yet appeals by the Ugandan government, the United Nations and aid
   agencies have fallen on deaf ears.

   But it is not too late.

   Donor countries, including the United States, the European Union and
   its member states, Australia, Canada, China and Japan, have an
   opportunity to change this tomorrow at the Uganda Solidarity Summit on
   Refugees in Kampala. The international community must step up and show
   its support to Uganda and the refugees it has given a warm welcome.
   Their lives depend on it.

Mexican official: CIA 'manages' drug trade

   Spokesman for Chihuahua state says US agencies don't want to end drug
   trade, a claim denied by other Mexican officials.
   Chris Arsenault by Chris Arsenault

   Mexican official: CIA 'manages' drug trade
   The CIA refused to comment directly on the allegations of complicity
   made by a low-level Mexican official [Reuters]

   Juarez, Mexico - The US Central Intelligence Agency and other
   international security forces "don't fight drug traffickers", a
   spokesman for the Chihuahua state government in northern Mexico has
   told Al Jazeera, instead "they try to manage the drug trade".

   Allegations about official complicity in the drug business are nothing
   new when they come from activists, professors, campaigners or even
   former officials. However, an official spokesman for the authorities in
   one of Mexico's most violent states - one which directly borders Texas
   - going on the record with such accusations is unique.

   "It's like pest control companies, they only control," Guillermo
   Terrazas Villanueva, the Chihuahua spokesman, told Al Jazeera last
   month at his office in Juarez. "If you finish off the pests, you are
   out of a job. If they finish the drug business, they finish their
   jobs."

                                               [201262591618218734_20.jpg]

   A spokesman for the CIA in Washington wouldn't comment on the
   accusations directly, instead he referred Al Jazeera to an official
   website.

   Accusations are 'baloney'

   Villanueva is not a high ranking official and his views do not
   represent Mexico's foreign policy establishment. Other more senior
   officials in Chihuahua State, including the mayor of Juarez, dismissed
   the claims as "baloney".

   "I think the CIA and DEA [US Drug Enforcement Agency] are on the same
   side as us in fighting drug gangs," Hector Murguia, the mayor of
   Juarez, told Al Jazeera during an interview inside his SUV. "We have
   excellent collaboration with the US."

   Under the Merida Initiative, the US Congress has approved more than
   $1.4bn in drug war aid for Mexico, providing attack helicopters,
   weapons and training for police and judges.

   More than 55,000 people have died in drug related violence in Mexico
   since December 2006. Privately, residents and officials across Mexico's
   political spectrum often blame the lethal cocktail of US drug
   consumption and the flow of high-powered weapons smuggled south of the
   border for causing much of the carnage.

   Drug war 'illusions'

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/26Bo_2xAwk4

   Meeting the Juarez cartel

   "The war on drugs is an illusion," Hugo Almada Mireles, professor at
   the Autonomous University of Juarez and author of several books, told
   Al Jazeera. "It's a reason to intervene in Latin America."

   "The CIA wants to control the population; they don't want to stop arms
   trafficking to Mexico, look at [Operation] Fast and Furious,” he said,
   referencing a botched US exercise where automatic weapons were sold to
   criminals in the hope that security forces could trace where the guns
   ended up.

   The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms lost track of 1,700 guns as
   part of the operation, including an AK-47 used in 2010 the murder of
   Brian Terry, a Customs and Border Protection Agent.

   Blaming the gringos for Mexico's problems has been a popular sport
   south of the Rio Grande ever since the Mexican-American war of the
   1840s, when the US conquered most of present day California, Utah,
   Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico from its southern neighbour. But
   operations such as Fast and Furious show that reality can be stranger
   than fiction when it comes to the drug war and relations between the US
   and Mexico. If the case hadn't been proven, the idea that US agents
   were actively putting weapons into the hands of Mexican gangsters would
   sound absurd to many.

   'Conspiracy theories'

   "I think it's easy to become cynical about American and other
   countries' involvement in Latin America around drugs," Kevin Sabet, a
   former senior adviser to the White House on drug control policy, told
   Al Jazeera. "Statements [accusing the CIA of managing the drug trade]
   should be backed up with evidence… I don’t put much stake in it."

   Villanueva's accusations "might be a way to get some attention to his
   region, which is understandable but not productive or grounded in
   reality", Sabet said. "We have sort of 'been there done that' with CIA
   conspiracy theories."

   In 1996, the San Jose Mercury News published Dark Alliance, a series of
   investigative reports linking CIA missions in Nicaragua with the
   explosion of crack cocaine consumption in America's ghettos.

   In order to fund Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's socialist
   government, the CIA partnered with Colombian cartels to move drugs into
   Los Angeles, sending profits back to Central America, the series
   alleged.

   "There is no question in my mind that people affiliated with, or on the
   payroll of, the CIA were involved in drug trafficking," US Senator John
   Kerry said at the time, in response to the series.

   Other newspapers, including the Washington Post and the Los Angeles
   Times, slammed Dark Alliance, and the editor of the Mercury News
   eventually wrote that the paper had over-stated some elements in the
   story and made mistakes in the journalistic process, but that he stood
   by many of the key conclusions.

   Widespread rumours

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/kHqeQ5iaEq8

   US government has neglected border corruption

   "It's true, they want to control it," a mid-level official with the
   Secretariat Gobernacion in Juarez, Mexico's equivalent to the US
   Department of Homeland Security, told Al Jazeera of the CIA and DEA's
   policing of the drug trade. The officer, speaking on the condition of
   anonymity, said he knew the allegations to be correct, based on
   discussions he had with US officials working in Juarez.

   Acceptance of these claims within some elements of Mexico's government
   and security services shows the difficulty in pursuing effective
   international action against the drug trade.

   Jesús Zambada Niebla, a leading trafficker from the Sinaloa cartel
   currently awaiting trial in Chicago, has said he was working for the US
   Drug Enforcement Agency during his days as a trafficker, and was
   promised immunity from prosecution.

   "Under that agreement, the Sinaloa Cartel under the leadership of
   [Jesus Zambada's] father, Ismael Zambada and 'Chapo' Guzmán were given
   carte blanche to continue to smuggle tonnes of illicit drugs... into...
   the United States, and were protected by the United States government
   from arrest and prosecution in return for providing information against
   rival cartels," Zambada's lawyers wrote as part of his defence.
   "Indeed, the Unites States government agents aided the leaders of the
   Sinaloa Cartel."

   The Sinaloa cartel is Mexico's oldest and most powerful trafficking
   organisation, and some analysts believe security forces in the US and
   Mexico favour the group over its rivals.

   Joaquin "El Chapo", the cartel's billionaire leader and one of the
   world's most wanted men, escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 by
   sneaking into a laundry truck - likely with collaboration from guards -
   further stoking rumours that leading traffickers have complicit friends
   in high places.

   "It would be easy for the Mexican army to capture El Chapo," Mireles
   said. "But this is not the objective." He thinks the authorities on
   both sides of the border are happy to have El Chapo on the loose, as
   his cartel is easier to manage and his drug money is recycled back into
   the broader economy. Other analysts consider this viewpoint a
   conspiracy theory and blame ineptitude and low level corruption for El
   Chapo's escape, rather than a broader plan from government agencies.

   Political changes

                                                                  In Depth

   After an election hit by reported irregularities, Enrique Pena Nieto
   from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) is set to be sworn in
   as Mexico's president on December 1.

   He wants to open a high-level dialogue with the US about the drug war,
   but has said legalisation of some drugs is not an option. Some
   hardliners in the US worry that Nieto will make a deal with some
   cartels, in order to reduce violence.

   "I am hopeful that he will not return to the PRI party of the past
   which was corrupt and had a history of turning a blind eye to the drug
   cartels," said Michael McCaul, a Republican Congressman from Texas.

   Regardless of what position a new administration takes in order to calm
   the violence and restore order, it is likely many Mexicans - including
   government officials such as Chihuahua spokesman Guillermo Villanueva -
   will believe outside forces want the drug trade to continue.

   The widespread view linking the CIA to the drug trade - whether or not
   the allegations are true - speaks volumes about officials' mutual
   mistrust amid ongoing killings and the destruction of civic life in
   Mexico.

   "We have good soldiers and policemen," Villanueva said. "But you won't
   resolve this problem with bullets. We need education and jobs."

India: 'World’s wettest place' suffers water shortage

   Climate change, population increase set off water shortages in what was
   once the wettest place on earth.

   India: 'World’s wettest place' suffers water shortage
   Despite a relatively wet environment, Cherrapunji is suffering from
   water shortage for human use [Subhamoy Bhattacharjee/Al Jazeera]

   Meghalaya state, India  -  For those recently debating climate change
   at the global summit in Paris, the coinciding deluge in India's
   southern city of Chennai seemed a powerful illustration that the
   gathering urgently needed to succeed in its aims.
   WATCH: Will the climate deal be enough to save the planet?

   While flooding hit the south, an increasing lack of water in
   Cherrapunji, a northeastern town which was once the world’s wettest
   place, is causing growing concern among residents.

   Both Indian examples point to the vicissitudes of climate change on our
   planet in a country where a rising population always creates huge
   pressures on the environment.

   In 1861, Cherrapunji, known to locals as Sohra, created a world record
   with 22,987mm of rainfall in a year.

   More than 150 years later, and experiencing an average annual rainfall
   of 11,430mm, it is still the second wettest place in the world.

   Mawsynram, a village just six kilometres away and boasting an average
   annual rainfall of 11,887km, is now considered the dampest place on the
   globe.

   However, the current rainfall in Cherrapunji, located in Meghalaya
   state, is just one third of what it was in the 1970s.

   declined over the past decades [Subhamoy Bhattacharjee / Al Jazeera ]

Deforestation

   The reasons for the dramatic decline in rainfall are disputed.

   Residents blame events beyond their control for the problems they face
   - the place is hotter, drier and shorter of water than even before.

   "We never had very large forests around Cherrapunji. Those that were
   there were sacred to us and we did not cut a branch," says Millergrace
   Symlieh, a senior member of the Sohra Science Society.

   "We are affected by what's happening all over the world," he told Al
   Jazeera.

   "This hot weather and less rain here is not due to huge deforestation
   or massive industrialisation. We only have a cement plant near here."

   However, Amarjyoti Borah of the Centre of Environment and Social Policy
   Research, based in India's northeastern city of Guwahati, says
   deforestation by illegal logging groups enjoying political patronage
   has badly damaged the forests around Cherrapunji, and that has
   adversely affected the local ecology.

   "The place still gets much rain, but with very few trees still
   standing, all the water just washes away downhill," says Borah.

   "There is no culture of rain harvesting here, as residents never felt
   it was necessary.

   "So Cherrapunji suffers acute water scarcity when the rainfall starts
   to drop sharply from November until March."

Population growth

   The past 10 years have seen a major drop in the average annual rainfall
   in Cherrapunji.

   "It is basically since 2005 that we are often getting 8,000mm to
   9,000mm of rain in Cherrapunji annually - against the normal average of
   11,000mm," says Amit Chaudhuri in the Cherrapunji weather office.

   Even Chadhuri’s "normal average" of 11,000mm of annual rain is a far
   cry from the 1970s, when Cherrapunji got almost double that amount of
   annual rainfall.

   In 1974, Cherrapunji experienced 24,555mm of annual rain, a world
   record.

   So at about 8,000mm to 9,000mm, the present average is only about a
   third of the town's annual rainfall compared with only 40 years ago.

   That was when Cherrapunji had far fewer people living in the town.

   In 1961, it had 7,000 residents – now it has 10 times more.

   "Our water supply was meant to cater to a small population, but now it
   cannot cater to a much bigger population," says Symlieh.

Water supply system

   Such is the shortage of water in the months between November and March
   that Cherrapunji's residents have to walk down the hill for several
   hours to fetch water from the springs.

   It is hard work, with buckets placed in wooden carts which are dragged
   uphill with some effort.

   "The other option is to buy water," says Mary Pariat, a housewife in
   Cherrapunji.

   Tankers loaded with water go up the hill to Cherrapunji every day in
   the lean months -   from November to March - and sell water for
   anything between 10 to 15 Indian rupees (about 20 cents) for a big
   bucket.

   "That is our last option," says Pariat, as she gestures towards a
   unique water point near her home - a leak in the town's water
   pipeline.

   "We put our buckets under the leak and collect the water," she says.
   "But often that is not enough."

   The water supply in the town provided by the state’s public health
   engineering department is active only for a few hours.

   "People rush to the taps in the localities and fill up as many buckets
   as possible," says community elder William Shalong. "For washing and
   bathing, we go down to the springs."

   But even the discharge in the springs drops sharply in the lean months
   - so the Public Health Engineering (PHE) would not be able to improve
   water supply in the town even if they wanted to.

   Officials of the department, unwilling to be quoted because they are
   not authorised to speak to the media, say the water supply system was
   built for 15,000 to 20,000 people.

   "How can that hold for 70,000 people," says a PHE official, pointing to
   the rising population's pressure on resources, a familiar story all
   over heavily populated India.

    'Earlier we got rains here even during the winters and that is not
   happening now,' says teacher Manora Nongbri. 'Now we have to purchase
   water in winter'   [Subhamoy Bhattacharjee/Al Jazeera]

Rainfall

   Reminiscing about Cherrapunji' s decades-old claim to fame, local
   teacher Ila Manora Nongbri said: "That seems like history. We can't
   expect that anymore.

   "Earlier, we got rains here even during the winters and that is not
   happening now. We have to purchase water here in the winter where
   before there was so much rain. We never learnt water harvesting, but we
   don't have a choice now."

   Meanwhile, her sister Mimi complains that rainfall is now very erratic.

   "We suddenly get rains when they are not expected and we don't get them
   when we expect them," she tells Al Jazeera.

   "Also rains have got very localised here and it does not rain all over
   the place anymore. Often one locality gets rain, while the other
   doesn't."

   Meghalaya is not alone in experiencing major changes in its climate.

   The neighbouring state of Assam was once, and perhaps still is ,famous
   for its destructive floods caused by rivers like the Brahmaputra.

   But for the past two years, during the late winter and summer months,
   half of its 28 districts have suffered drought.

Drought

   India named Meghalaya - "home of the clouds" in Hindi - when a new
   separate hill state was created from the Khasi, Garo and Jaintia Hills
   of the large imperial province of Assam in 1972.

   But the kind of relentless downpour for 14 days that the Khasi
   tribespeople here called "khadsaw-miat" is clearly a thing of the past.

   Now the Khasi say "slaup" for rain, but they also have a new word in
   their vocabulary, picked up from English - "drought". And when they
   talk of drought in Meghalaya, there is little doubt the world is
   changing - as is its climate.

India unveils Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft for moon-landing mission

   ISRO plans controlled landing of rover on moon which, if successful,
   will make India fourth country to achieve the feat.

   India has said it will launch its second lunar mission in mid-July, as
   it moves to consolidate its status as a leader in space technology by
   achieving a controlled landing on the moon.

   The mission, if successful, would make India only the fourth country
   behind the United States, Russia and China to perform a "soft" landing
   on the moon and put a rover on it. China successfully landed a lunar
   rover in January.

   The unmanned mission, called Chandrayaan-2, which means "moon vehicle"
   in Sanskrit, will involve an orbiter, a lander and a rover, which have
   been built by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).
   190401093645706

   The mission is scheduled to launch on July 15 on board ISRO's
   Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III. It will cost about 10
   billion rupees ($144m), ISRO said on Wednesday.

   After a journey of more than 50 days, ISRO's lander will attempt a
   "soft", controlled landing near the lunar South Pole around September
   6.

   Once it touches down, the rover will carry out experiments while being
   controlled remotely by ISRO scientists.

   "The last 15 minutes to the landing are going to be the most terrifying
   moments for us," ISRO Chairman K. Sivan told media. The agency said
   variations in lunar gravity, terrain and dust could all cause problems.

'Most complex mission'

   The Indian mission would be the third attempted lunar landing this year
   after China's successful Chang'e-4 lunar probe and the Israeli
   spacecraft Beresheet, which failed and crashed onto the moon in April.

   "It is the most complex mission ISRO has ever undertaken," Sivan said.

   Chandrayaan-1, India's first lunar mission in 2008, cost $79m and
   helped confirm the presence of water on the moon.

   The Chandrayaan-2 was originally planned as a collaboration with
   Russia's Roscosmos space agency, but in 2013 India scrapped the tie-up
   due to technical differences with the Russian programme.

   In 2014, India launched an unmanned Mars mission at a cost of $74m, or
   less than the budget of the Hollywood space blockbuster, Gravity, and a
   fraction of the $671m the US space agency NASA spent on its MAVEN Mars
   mission.

   In 2017, India launched a record 104 satellites in a single mission and
   has also built a reputation for low-cost space exploration and science
   missions.

   In March, India said it shot down one of its own satellites, making it
   one of only four countries in the world to possess this technology.

Democrats call contents of whistle-blower complaint 'disturbing'

   Washington, DC - US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff
   told reporters on Wednesday that allegations laid out in
   the whistle-blower complaint concerning President Donald Trump were
   "very credible" and "deeply disturbing".

   After previously resisting calls from members of Congress to release
   the complaint, the White House sent its contents to the House and
   Senate Intelligence Committees on Wednesday.

   "The report reinforces our concerns," said House Democrat Mike Quigley.

   "It's serious. It's troubling. It's detailed. It's thorough. It
   deserves consideration by the American people," said Representative
   Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat member of the Intelligence Committee.

   Republican Senator Ben Sasse told reporters that there are "real
   troubling" things in the report, adding that "Republicans ought not
   just circle the wagons".

   But other Republicans said they did not see anything that was
   concerning to them.

   "I haven't seen anything that bothers me," said Mike Conaway, a
   Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee.

   The Trump administration's decision to release the complaint's contents
   to the committees came just hours before the House voted 421-0 on a
   non-binding resolution condemning the Trump administration for
   withholding its contents and demanding its release. Two representatives
   voted present.

   Reports of the complaint, as well as Trump comments surrounding it,
   were the basis of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to announce the House
   was moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry of Trump.

   The complaint was reportedly centred on a June phone call between Trump
   and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the US president
   prodded his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate political rival Joe
   Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination. A
   memo of the phone call was released earlier on Wednesday.

   Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire had been
   prevented from giving Congress the whistle-blower complaint by White
   House and Justice Department lawyers who argued it did not rise to a
   sufficient level of concern. Maguire is scheduled to testify publicly
   before Schiff's committee on Thursday.

   Wednesday's House vote came after the US Senate unanimously approved a
   similar non-binding resolution with Republicans joining Democrats in
   support of the measure and putting pressure on the White House to be
   more forthcoming.

'I didn't do it'

   Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. At a news conference before
   Wednesday's vote, Trump denied he had linked delivery of US military
   aid to Zelensky's help in investigating Biden.

   "I didn't do it," Trump said. "You take a look at that call. It was
   perfect. There was no quid pro quo."
   At the time of the call, Trump was withholding nearly $400m in military
   aid to Ukraine.

   He has called the Democrats' impeachment inquiry "witch-hunt garbage"
   and a "hoax".

   "I respect the responsibility of the president to engage with foreign
   leaders as part of his job. It is not part of his job to use taxpayer
   money to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign,"
   Pelosi said in a statement released by her office earlier today.
   Schiff told reporters at a news conference the president's phone call
   "was a classic Mafia-like shakedown".
   Many House Democrats called the information in the Trump-Zelensky call
   evidence of impeachable conduct by the president. Others withheld
   judgment saying the goal of the impeachment inquiry should be to
   methodically assemble the facts.

   "It's treason. It's treason. And treason, last time I checked, is an
   impeachable offence," Representative Peter DeFazio, a 17-term senior
   Democrat, told reporters in the Capitol.
   "You have to lay out the facts very carefully. We don't have all the
   facts yet. That's why we are going to have hearings because you have to
   gather the facts, particularly on this Ukrainian situation," said
   Representative Donna Shalala, who served in the administration of
   former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment in 1998.
   Republicans sought to discount the implications of what Trump said in
   the phone call, saying there is no evidence the president was linking
   the future delivery of US military aid to Zelensky opening an
   investigation of Biden's family.

   Americans are tired of what they see as political games in Washington,
   said Representative Dan Crenshaw, a Republican and former US Navy SEAL.
   "The Russian collusion thing, all of this stuff, this is so far down
   the list when it comes to regular voters," Crenshaw told Al Jazeera.

   "They see this as noise in the media. They are exhausted by what they
   perceive to be political games. And in this case, boy, are they right,"
   he added. "This is the height of political gamesmanship. This attempt
   to read-in to some kind of ill intent behind the president's
   conversation is beyond the pale. You have really got to squint. You
   have got to do mental gymnastics."

   Representative Al Green, the first Democrat to push for impeachment
   earlier this year, said he expects the political dialogue going forward
   in the US to be divisive as Democrats move forward on impeachment.
   "I don't think this is going to be easy for us because it hasn't been
   easy for me. I am the guy who has received death threats. I'm the guy
   that they said they want to lynch," Green told Al Jazeera. "It hasn't
   been easy for me. It is not going to be easy for any of us. But we have
   got to put principle above politics."

   The House is preparing to take a two-week break from Washington and
   members will be going home to their districts where they inevitably
   will have to face voter's questions.
   "It is very important that members go home and explain to their
   constituents their thinking," Representative Steny Hoyer, the
   number-two Democrat leader, told reporters. "This is a matter of grave
   importance and the American people need to understand what is
   occurring."
