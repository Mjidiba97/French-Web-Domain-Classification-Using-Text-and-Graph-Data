   Since we integrated the customer journey attribution model with
   Tradedoubler, we got all the way positive feedback. We analysed that a
   lot of partners, which were not considered in the last click model, are
   profiting of the new model. All in all it’s a big benefit for us and
   the partners and we will start rolling out the attribution model in
   more countries.

   Plan.Net Performance recently migrated the IKEA DE program to
   Tradedoubler.  The migration was processed without any issues and on
   time.  We were pleased that the migration, far from having an adverse
   effect on the program revenue, had a positive effect which was achieved
   through the pro-active account management and re-engagement of
   publishers throughout the process and since.

Part 2 – Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting privacy principles

Introduction

   Tradedoubler processes digital information about Users (web surfers)
   who visit websites belonging to Clients with whom Tradedoubler has
   contracted to serve advertisements (the „Advertising Network“). This
   part of the Privacy Policy lets you know what information we collect
   and process about you as a User on behalf of our Clients, why we
   collect it and how it is used in relation to our Interest Based
   Advertising and Retargeting services to our Clients. The Policy
   contains instructions on how you can display and delete information
   collected by Tradedoubler yourself and how you can opt-out from further
   Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting activities of Tradedoubler.
   Further, the Policy contains instructions to our publishers on how to
   notify Users about Tradedoubler’s services on their websites.

What is Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting?

   There exists a range of different kinds of online Interest Based
   Advertising and Retargeting services; from fairly simple forms to the
   far-reaching monitoring of web surfer activities carried out by
   search-engine owners or services carried out in partnerships between
   technology companies and Internet Service Providers. As a common
   denomination, you could say that Interest Based Advertising and
   Retargeting is intended to make online display advertising more
   relevant to web surfers‘ likely interests.

   Tradedoubler’s Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services use
   a combination of cookie- and cookieless technologies.. „Cookies“ are
   small simple text files (not programs or spyware) stored on the hard
   drive of a web surfer’s computer. Cookie-less solutions gather data
   points from the User´s device to create a unique ID for the device. The
   data points collected are non-PII (non-Personally Identifiable
   Information). Based on the anonymous information stored in the User’s
   cookie, Tradedoubler is able provide more relevant advertising to the
   User on behalf of our Clients. For example, a User that visits sports
   sites often will be categorized in the „sports fan“ segment, and will
   primarily be served advertisements that are relevant to the interests
   of a sports fan, and a User that shows interest in a certain car model
   or a certain computer model, may be served advertisements or specific
   offers for such car model or computer model.

   Tradedoubler may also link multiple devices used by a single User into
   an anonymous user profile. This is done withhashed (anonymous,
   de-identified) User login IDs used across various devices to login to
   websites belonging to Tradedoubler’s Advertising Network by the User.
   Such linking enables Tradedoubler to offer its IBA and Retargeting
   services across devices but not to identify the User.

   The fundamental integrity principle underlying all Tradedoubler’s
   processing of digital data relating to Users, is that such data shall
   be anonymous. Therefore, we do not store IP addresses on the cookie of
   a User, only a unique randomly generated ID that does not allow
   Tradedoubler to identify the User; we do not have, and will not
   initiate, any co-operation with Internet Service Providers in order to
   identify Users. The data stored on the cookie is limited to information
   collected at the User’s visits to websites belonging to Tradedoubler’s
   Advertising Network. With the exception of a marginal proportion of
   cookie data saved for statistical purposes solely, a User’s cookie can
   only be viewed by Tradedoubler when the User visits a website that
   belongs to our Advertising Network.

Information stored on cookies

   The cookie information stored on the User’s hard drive for Interest
   Based Advertising and Retargeting purposes is: (i) User segment hits or
   information on a specific product, service, brand or model in which the
   User has shown interest during its visit to a certain website (for
   example a User that visits a sport site of one of Tradedoubler’s
   Clients, will record a hit in the ’sports‘ segment and a User that has
   shown interest in a certain car model will record a hit of that car
   model) and (ii) time and date stamp of the latest update of the User
   profile. The User segments used by Tradedoubler for cookie hits are:
   (1) Animals; (2) Humanities; (3) Automotive (4) Business; (5) Computers
   & electronics; (6) Entertainment; (7) Finance; (8) Food & drink; (9)

   For the sake of clarity, no segments relating to sensitive information
   have been or will be created, such as segments relating to political
   opinions, religious beliefs, physical or mental health conditions or
   sexual life. Further, Tradedoubler is very sensitive to the issue of
   children’s privacy and marketing directed to children. No segments are
   intended to be established for the profiling of children.

Use of collected digital data

   Tradedoubler will use the User data in order to better target
   advertisements on behalf of our Clients, to provide aggregated
   non-personal reporting to our Clients, and to improve our advertising
   systems and products. The data may be combined with other anonymous
   information collected from other sources so that we may better serve
   Users with offers that may be of interest to them. We may also share
   anonymous data between companies within the Tradedoubler group of
   companies.

Security

   Tradedoubler is dedicated to maintain the security of all its data and
   to prevent unauthorized access through the implementation of
   appropriate technical and organizational measures, as far as is
   reasonably possible. Such security measures also include access
   restrictions, i.e. that data may be accessed only by a limited number
   of persons within Tradedoubler.

   Our employees are made aware of and must comply with Tradedoubler’s
   security measures. When we occasionally use third-party contractors to
   perform tasks that might otherwise be performed by our employees, these
   contractors are contractually bound to adhere to this Privacy Policy
   and they are subject to similar restrictions as our employees.

Part 2 – Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting privacy principles

Introduction

   Tradedoubler processes digital information about Users (web surfers)
   who visit websites belonging to Clients with whom Tradedoubler has
   contracted to serve advertisements (the „Advertising Network“). This
   part of the Privacy Policy lets you know what information we collect
   and process about you as a User on behalf of our Clients, why we
   collect it and how it is used in relation to our Interest Based
   Advertising and Retargeting services to our Clients. The Policy
   contains instructions on how you can display and delete information
   collected by Tradedoubler yourself and how you can opt-out from further
   Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting activities of Tradedoubler.
   Further, the Policy contains instructions to our publishers on how to
   notify Users about Tradedoubler’s services on their websites.

What is Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting?

   There exists a range of different kinds of online Interest Based
   Advertising and Retargeting services; from fairly simple forms to the
   far-reaching monitoring of web surfer activities carried out by
   search-engine owners or services carried out in partnerships between
   technology companies and Internet Service Providers. As a common
   denomination, you could say that Interest Based Advertising and
   Retargeting is intended to make online display advertising more
   relevant to web surfers‘ likely interests.

   Tradedoubler’s Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services use
   a combination of cookie- and cookieless technologies.. „Cookies“ are
   small simple text files (not programs or spyware) stored on the hard
   drive of a web surfer’s computer. Cookie-less solutions gather data
   points from the User´s device to create a unique ID for the device. The
   data points collected are non-PII (non-Personally Identifiable
   Information). Based on the anonymous information stored in the User’s
   cookie, Tradedoubler is able provide more relevant advertising to the
   User on behalf of our Clients. For example, a User that visits sports
   sites often will be categorized in the „sports fan“ segment, and will
   primarily be served advertisements that are relevant to the interests
   of a sports fan, and a User that shows interest in a certain car model
   or a certain computer model, may be served advertisements or specific
   offers for such car model or computer model.

   Tradedoubler may also link multiple devices used by a single User into
   an anonymous user profile. This is done withhashed (anonymous,
   de-identified) User login IDs used across various devices to login to
   websites belonging to Tradedoubler’s Advertising Network by the User.
   Such linking enables Tradedoubler to offer its IBA and Retargeting
   services across devices but not to identify the User.

   The fundamental integrity principle underlying all Tradedoubler’s
   processing of digital data relating to Users, is that such data shall
   be anonymous. Therefore, we do not store IP addresses on the cookie of
   a User, only a unique randomly generated ID that does not allow
   Tradedoubler to identify the User; we do not have, and will not
   initiate, any co-operation with Internet Service Providers in order to
   identify Users. The data stored on the cookie is limited to information
   collected at the User’s visits to websites belonging to Tradedoubler’s
   Advertising Network. With the exception of a marginal proportion of
   cookie data saved for statistical purposes solely, a User’s cookie can
   only be viewed by Tradedoubler when the User visits a website that
   belongs to our Advertising Network.

   shown interest in a certain car model will record a hit of that car
   model) and (ii) time and date stamp of the latest update of the User
   profile. The User segments used by Tradedoubler for cookie hits are:

   In den ersten zwei Jahren der Zusammenarbeit hat NA-KD
   einen erheblichen internationalen Erfolg feststellen können. Wir sind
   zwar für unsere Influencer-Aktivitäten bekannt, jedoch liegt unser
   Fokus auch darauf, den richtigen digitalen Kanal zu finden, um
   qualitativen Traffic zu erzeugen. Tradedoubler spielte eine wichtige
   Rolle darin, neue Kanäle zu testen und neue Zielgruppen zu erreichen,
   die wir sonst nicht erreicht hätten.
   Christopher Fänge

   Ich bewerte die Kooperation äußerst positiv. Die Tatsache, dass wir
   seit über 10 Jahren zusammen arbeiten, ist wohl die beste Bestätigung

   Plan.Net Perfomance hat vor Kurzem das IKEA DE-Programm bei
   Tradedoubler eingeführt. Die Migration erfolgte problemlos und
   pünktlich. Wir waren sehr erfreut darüber, dass die Migration nicht zu
   Umsatzrückgängen führte, sondern sogar einen positiven Effekt hatte.
   Dies wurde durch das proaktive Account Management und die
   Neuverpflichtungen von Publishern während des gesamten Prozesses
   erreicht.

   Seitdem wir das Customer Journey Attribution-Modell bei Tradedoubler
   integiert haben, haben wir nur positives Feedback erhalten. Wir haben
   festgestellt, dass einige unserer Partner, die im Last Click-Modell
   nicht berücksichtigt worden sind, von dem neuen Modell profitieren.
   Generell ist das ein großer Vorteil für uns und unsere Partner, und wir
   werden das Attribution-Modell in mehreren Ländern ausrollen.

   Depuis que nous avons intégré le modèle d’attribution du « customer
   Journey » avec Tradedoubler, nous n’avons eu que des retours positifs.
   Nous avons analysé que de nombreux partenaires qui n’étaient pas
   considérés dans le modèle de « Last click » profitent désormais du
   nouveau modèle. En fin de compte, c’est un gros bénéfice pour nos
   partenaires et nous-mêmes : nous allons commencer à déployer ce modèle
   d’attribution dans plus de pays.

   Since we integrated the customer journey attribution model with
   Tradedoubler, we got all the way positive feedback. We analysed that a
   lot of partners, which were not considered in the last click model, are
   profiting of the new model. All in all it’s a big benefit for us and
   the partners and we will start rolling out the attribution model in
   more countries.

   Plan.Net Performance recently migrated the IKEA DE program to
   Tradedoubler.  The migration was processed without any issues and on
   time.  We were pleased that the migration, far from having an adverse
   effect on the program revenue, had a positive effect which was achieved
   through the pro-active account management and re-engagement of
   publishers throughout the process and since.

Part 2 – Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting privacy principles

Introduction

   Tradedoubler processes digital information about Users (web surfers)
   who visit websites belonging to Clients with whom Tradedoubler has
   contracted to serve advertisements (the „Advertising Network“). This
   part of the Privacy Policy lets you know what information we collect
   and process about you as a User on behalf of our Clients, why we
   collect it and how it is used in relation to our Interest Based
   Advertising and Retargeting services to our Clients. The Policy
   contains instructions on how you can display and delete information
   collected by Tradedoubler yourself and how you can opt-out from further
   Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting activities of Tradedoubler.
   Further, the Policy contains instructions to our publishers on how to
   notify Users about Tradedoubler’s services on their websites.

What is Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting?

   There exists a range of different kinds of online Interest Based
   Advertising and Retargeting services; from fairly simple forms to the
   far-reaching monitoring of web surfer activities carried out by
   search-engine owners or services carried out in partnerships between
   technology companies and Internet Service Providers. As a common
   denomination, you could say that Interest Based Advertising and
   Retargeting is intended to make online display advertising more
   relevant to web surfers‘ likely interests.

   Tradedoubler’s Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services use
   a combination of cookie- and cookieless technologies.. „Cookies“ are
   small simple text files (not programs or spyware) stored on the hard
   drive of a web surfer’s computer. Cookie-less solutions gather data
   points from the User´s device to create a unique ID for the device. The
   data points collected are non-PII (non-Personally Identifiable
   Information). Based on the anonymous information stored in the User’s
   cookie, Tradedoubler is able provide more relevant advertising to the
   User on behalf of our Clients. For example, a User that visits sports
   sites often will be categorized in the „sports fan“ segment, and will
   primarily be served advertisements that are relevant to the interests
   of a sports fan, and a User that shows interest in a certain car model
   or a certain computer model, may be served advertisements or specific
   offers for such car model or computer model.

   Tradedoubler may also link multiple devices used by a single User into
   an anonymous user profile. This is done withhashed (anonymous,
   de-identified) User login IDs used across various devices to login to
   websites belonging to Tradedoubler’s Advertising Network by the User.
   Such linking enables Tradedoubler to offer its IBA and Retargeting
   services across devices but not to identify the User.

   The fundamental integrity principle underlying all Tradedoubler’s
   processing of digital data relating to Users, is that such data shall
   be anonymous. Therefore, we do not store IP addresses on the cookie of
   a User, only a unique randomly generated ID that does not allow
   Tradedoubler to identify the User; we do not have, and will not
   initiate, any co-operation with Internet Service Providers in order to
   identify Users. The data stored on the cookie is limited to information
   collected at the User’s visits to websites belonging to Tradedoubler’s
   Advertising Network. With the exception of a marginal proportion of
   cookie data saved for statistical purposes solely, a User’s cookie can
   only be viewed by Tradedoubler when the User visits a website that
   belongs to our Advertising Network.

Targeting information

   tion

Information stored on cookies

   The cookie information stored on the User’s hard drive for Interest
   Based Advertising and Retargeting purposes is: (i) User segment hits or
   information on a specific product, service, brand or model in which the
   User has shown interest during its visit to a certain website (for
   example a User that visits a sport site of one of Tradedoubler’s
   Clients, will record a hit in the ’sports‘ segment and a User that has
   shown interest in a certain car model will record a hit of that car
   model) and (ii) time and date stamp of the latest update of the User
   profile. The User segments used by Tradedoubler for cookie hits are:
   (1) Animals; (2) Humanities; (3) Automotive (4) Business; (5) Computers
   & electronics; (6) Entertainment; (7) Finance; (8) Food & drink; (9)
   Gaming; (10) Health & beauty; (11) Home & garden; (12) Insurance; (13)
   Lifestyle & society; (14) News & current events; (15) Reference; (16)
   Shopping & retail; (17) Social; (18) Sports & recreation; and (19)
   Telecom & utilities

   For the sake of clarity, no segments relating to sensitive information
   have been or will be created, such as segments relating to political
   opinions, religious beliefs, physical or mental health conditions or
   sexual life. Further, Tradedoubler is very sensitive to the issue of
   children’s privacy and marketing directed to children. No segments are
   intended to be established for the profiling of children.

Use of collected digital data

   Tradedoubler will use the User data in order to better target
   advertisements on behalf of our Clients, to provide aggregated
   non-personal reporting to our Clients, and to improve our advertising
   systems and products. The data may be combined with other anonymous
   information collected from other sources so that we may better serve
   Users with offers that may be of interest to them. We may also share
   anonymous data between companies within the Tradedoubler group of
   companies.

Security

   Tradedoubler is dedicated to maintain the security of all its data and
   to prevent unauthorized access through the implementation of
   appropriate technical and organizational measures, as far as is
   reasonably possible. Such security measures also include access
   restrictions, i.e. that data may be accessed only by a limited number
   of persons within Tradedoubler.

   Our employees are made aware of and must comply with Tradedoubler’s
   security measures. When we occasionally use third-party contractors to
   perform tasks that might otherwise be performed by our employees, these
   contractors are contractually bound to adhere to this Privacy Policy
   and they are subject to similar restrictions as our employees.

Opt-out

   You may at any time easily block further Interest Based Advertising and
   Retargeting activities which are based on cookie-, cookieless or
   Cross-device tracking from Tradedoubler by opting-out. To do so please
   follow the instructions above in section “Tradedoubler’s targeting
   technologies”..

   In addition, note that you are always able to prevent cookies from any
   website from being installed on your computer by readjusting your
   browser settings. For more information about cookies and how to disable
   them, you should consult the help section of your browser.

   If the cookie is deleted by the User, all profile data is removed.

Publisher notification

   If you are a publisher, please note that you are obligated to notify
   visitors of your website about third parties who are serving
   advertisements on your website by way of use of cookies. If using
   Tradedoubler’s cross-device tracking solution, you are required to
   notify visitors to your website of this fact, gain their consent for
   passing data to Tradedoubler and to hash the data in accordance with
   Tradeoubler´s instructions before sending it to Tradedoubler. As a
   party to the publisher agreement with Tradedoubler, you agree to
   provide clear and unambiguous notice about this. In relation to
   Tradedoubler’s Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting (if you have
   chosen to be provided with such services), such information shall at
   least include the following text:

   “By using our website you consent to our Privacy policy [Link]
   includingthird-party advertising companies serving ads when you visit
   our website. These companies may use information (not including your
   name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to
   this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods
   and services of interest to you. In order to do this, our advertising
   partners may place a cookie (a small text file) on your computer; or
   collect device ids or other device data and link you various devices to
   the same anonymous user profile using hashed (de-identified) user login
   ids. Please, read our Privacy policy [Link] for detailed information
   and for instructions to disable third-party advertising.

   For avoidance of doubt, please note that the foregoing requirement of
   notification does not limit any of your obligations according to
   applicable law. You are yourself as a publisher responsible for
   providing relevant and accurate information required by law, including
   applicable privacy laws.

Part 2 – Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting privacy principles

Introduction

   Tradedoubler processes digital information about Users (web surfers)
   who visit websites belonging to Clients with whom Tradedoubler has
   contracted to serve advertisements (the „Advertising Network“). This
   part of the Privacy Policy lets you know what information we collect
   and process about you as a User on behalf of our Clients, why we
   collect it and how it is used in relation to our Interest Based
   Advertising and Retargeting services to our Clients. The Policy
   contains instructions on how you can display and delete information
   collected by Tradedoubler yourself and how you can opt-out from further
   Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting activities of Tradedoubler.
   Further, the Policy contains instructions to our publishers on how to
   notify Users about Tradedoubler’s services on their websites.

What is Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting?

   There exists a range of different kinds of online Interest Based
   Advertising and Retargeting services; from fairly simple forms to the
   far-reaching monitoring of web surfer activities carried out by
   search-engine owners or services carried out in partnerships between
   technology companies and Internet Service Providers. As a common
   denomination, you could say that Interest Based Advertising and
   Retargeting is intended to make online display advertising more
   relevant to web surfers‘ likely interests.

   Tradedoubler’s Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services use
   a combination of cookie- and cookieless technologies.. „Cookies“ are
   small simple text files (not programs or spyware) stored on the hard
   drive of a web surfer’s computer. Cookie-less solutions gather data
   points from the User´s device to create a unique ID for the device. The
   data points collected are non-PII (non-Personally Identifiable
   Information). Based on the anonymous information stored in the User’s
   cookie, Tradedoubler is able provide more relevant advertising to the
   User on behalf of our Clients. For example, a User that visits sports
   sites often will be categorized in the „sports fan“ segment, and will
   primarily be served advertisements that are relevant to the interests
   of a sports fan, and a User that shows interest in a certain car model
   or a certain computer model, may be served advertisements or specific
   offers for such car model or computer model.

   Tradedoubler may also link multiple devices used by a single User into
   an anonymous user profile. This is done withhashed (anonymous,
   de-identified) User login IDs used across various devices to login to
   websites belonging to Tradedoubler’s Advertising Network by the User.
   Such linking enables Tradedoubler to offer its IBA and Retargeting
   services across devices but not to identify the User.

   The fundamental integrity principle underlying all Tradedoubler’s
   processing of digital data relating to Users, is that such data shall
   be anonymous. Therefore, we do not store IP addresses on the cookie of
   a User, only a unique randomly generated ID that does not allow
   Tradedoubler to identify the User; we do not have, and will not
   initiate, any co-operation with Internet Service Providers in order to
   identify Users. The data stored on the cookie is limited to information
   collected at the User’s visits to websites belonging to Tradedoubler’s
   Advertising Network. With the exception of a marginal proportion of
   cookie data saved for statistical purposes solely, a User’s cookie can
   only be viewed by Tradedoubler when the User visits a website that
   belongs to our Advertising Network.

Information stored on cookies

   The cookie information stored on the User’s hard drive for Interest
   Based Advertising and Retargeting purposes is: (i) User segment hits or
   information on a specific product, service, brand or model in which the
   User has shown interest during its visit to a certain website (for
   example a User that visits a sport site of one of Tradedoubler’s
   Clients, will record a hit in the ’sports‘ segment and a User that has
   shown interest in a certain car model will record a hit of that car
   model) and (ii) time and date stamp of the latest update of the User
   profile. The User segments used by Tradedoubler for cookie hits are:
   (1) Animals; (2) Humanities; (3) Automotive (4) Business; (5) Computers
   & electronics; (6) Entertainment; (7) Finance; (8) Food & drink; (9)
   Gaming; (10) Health & beauty; (11) Home & garden; (12) Insurance; (13)
   Lifestyle & society; (14) News & current events; (15) Reference; (16)
   Shopping & retail; (17) Social; (18) Sports & recreation; and (19)
   Telecom & utilities

   For the sake of clarity, no segments relating to sensitive information
   have been or will be created, such as segments relating to political
   opinions, religious beliefs, physical or mental health conditions or
   sexual life. Further, Tradedoubler is very sensitive to the issue of
   children’s privacy and marketing directed to children. No segments are
   intended to be established for the profiling of children.

Use of collected digital data

   Tradedoubler will use the User data in order to better target
   advertisements on behalf of our Clients, to provide aggregated
   non-personal reporting to our Clients, and to improve our advertising
   systems and products. The data may be combined with other anonymous
   information collected from other sources so that we may better serve
   Users with offers that may be of interest to them. We may also share
   anonymous data between companies within the Tradedoubler group of
   companies.

Security

   Tradedoubler is dedicated to maintain the security of all its data and
   to prevent unauthorized access through the implementation of
   appropriate technical and organizational measures, as far as is
   reasonably possible. Such security measures also include access
   restrictions, i.e. that data may be accessed only by a limited number
   of persons within Tradedoubler.

   Our employees are made aware of and must comply with Tradedoubler’s
   security measures. When we occasionally use third-party contractors to
   perform tasks that might otherwise be performed by our employees, these
   contractors are contractually bound to adhere to this Privacy Policy
   and they are subject to similar restrictions as our employees.

   Retargeting activities which are based on cookie-, cookieless or
   Cross-device tracking from Tradedoubler by opting-out. To do so please

   In den ersten zwei Jahren der Zusammenarbeit hat NA-KD
   einen erheblichen internationalen Erfolg feststellen können. Wir sind
   zwar für unsere Influencer-Aktivitäten bekannt, jedoch liegt unser
   Fokus auch darauf, den richtigen digitalen Kanal zu finden, um
   qualitativen Traffic zu erzeugen. Tradedoubler spielte eine wichtige
   Rolle darin, neue Kanäle zu testen und neue Zielgruppen zu erreichen,
   die wir sonst nicht erreicht hätten.
   Christopher Fänge

   Ich bewerte die Kooperation äußerst positiv. Die Tatsache, dass wir
   seit über 10 Jahren zusammen arbeiten, ist wohl die beste Bestätigung
   und Weiterempfehlung.

   Seit vielen Jahren arbeiten wir eng mit Tradedoubler zusammen, um

   Ich arbeite seit 10 Jahren mit Tradedoubler in verschiedenen

   Bei Traventina wollten den Affiliate-Kanal testen und haben
   Tradedoubler als Partner gewählt. Wir sind sehr zufrieden mit den
   Ergebnissen, da wir im vergangenen Jahr, dank der hervorragenden Arbeit
   und des Engagements von Traventina und Tradedoubler unseren Umsatz um
   400% gesteigert haben.

   Plan.Net Perfomance hat vor Kurzem das IKEA DE-Programm bei
   Tradedoubler eingeführt. Die Migration erfolgte problemlos und
   pünktlich. Wir waren sehr erfreut darüber, dass die Migration nicht zu
   Umsatzrückgängen führte, sondern sogar einen positiven Effekt hatte.
   Dies wurde durch das proaktive Account Management und die
   Neuverpflichtungen von Publishern während des gesamten Prozesses
   erreicht.

   Seitdem wir das Customer Journey Attribution-Modell bei Tradedoubler
   integiert haben, haben wir nur positives Feedback erhalten. Wir haben
   festgestellt, dass einige unserer Partner, die im Last Click-Modell
   nicht berücksichtigt worden sind, von dem neuen Modell profitieren.
   Generell ist das ein großer Vorteil für uns und unsere Partner, und wir
   werden das Attribution-Modell in mehreren Ländern ausrollen.

   The first two years of business, NA-KD has seen significant growth not

   has played an important role in testing new channels, ultimately
   reaching new audiences that we wouldn’t reach through  our own

   Depuis que nous avons intégré le modèle d’attribution du « customer
   Journey » avec Tradedoubler, nous n’avons eu que des retours positifs.
   Nous avons analysé que de nombreux partenaires qui n’étaient pas
   considérés dans le modèle de « Last click » profitent désormais du
   nouveau modèle. En fin de compte, c’est un gros bénéfice pour nos
   partenaires et nous-mêmes : nous allons commencer à déployer ce modèle
   d’attribution dans plus de pays.

   Plan.Net Performance ha recentemente migrato il programma IKEA DE su
   Tradedoubler. La migrazione è stata effettuata senza problemi e in
   tempi brevi. Siamo lieti che la migrazione, lungi dall’avere un effetto
   negativo sulle revenue del programma, abbia avuto un esito positivo
   grazie alla gestione proattiva degli account e al trasferimento degli
   editori durante il processo.

   In Traventia volevamo testare il canale di affiliazione e Tradedoubler
   è stato il partner prescelto. Siamo molto soddisfatti dei risultati,
   avendo aumentato il nostro fatturato del 400% lo scorso anno, grazie
   all’ottimo lavoro e all’impegno da entrambe le parti, Traventia e
   Tradedoubler.

   Da quando abbiamo integrato il modello di attribuzione mediante
   Customer Jounrey con Tradedoubler, abbiamo ottenuto un ottimo
   riscontro. Dalle analisi abbiamo evidenziato che molti partner, che non
   venivano premiati da un modello di attribuzione in last click, traggono
   profitto dal nuovo modello. Tutto sommato è un grande vantaggio per noi
   e per i partner e inizieremo ad implementare lo stesso modello di
   attribuzione in più paesi.

   Nel corso degli ultimi 10 anni ho avuto l’opportunità di lavorare con
   Tradedoubler in diverse aziende e su vari Paesi. Sono riusciti a
   raggiungere quello che, a mio parere, è il più complesso livello di
   servizio che un network di affiliazione può offrire; sono un partner di
   fiducia che ha a cuore il tuo business e fa propri i tuoi obbiettivi.

   Sedan vi integrerade customer journey attribution-modellen har vi
   enbart fått positiv feedback. Genom att ge våra partners information om
   hur hela kundresan ser ut, från första till sista klick, skapas en
   bättre förståelse för hur man ska fördela budgetar för att maximera sin
   försäljning. Detta gynnar både oss och våra partners och vi siktar på
   att lansera denna modell i fler länder.

   Plan.Net Performance migrerade IKEAs tyska affiliateprogram till
   Tradedoubler. Processen gick utan problem och blev gjord i tid. Vi är
   nöjda över att migrationen genomfördes utan negativ inverkan på
   programintäkterna. Vi ser positiva effekter som uppnåtts genom
   proaktivt arbete under hela processen och effektivt återinförande av
   publicister.

   Tradedoublers white label-lösning har alla nödvändiga verktyg för vår

   På Traventia ville vi testa affiliatemarknadsföring och valet av
   partner föll på Tradedoubler. Vi är mycket nöjda med resultatet och har
   ökat omsättningen med 400% under förra året, mycket tack vara
   fantastiskt engagemang och samarbetet mellan Traventia och

   Jag har jobbat med Tradedoubler under de senaste 10 åren via olika
   företag och länder. Tradedoubler har lyckats uppnå det som, enligt min
   mening, är bland den svåraste av servicen ett affiliatenätverk kan
   uppnå.
   De är riktiga partners som verkligen bryr sig om ditt företag och gör
   dina mål till sina egna.
   David Ibáñez

   De första två åren har NA-KD haft en väsentlig tillväxt, inte bara i
   sitt hemland Sverige utan  även internationellt.
   Vi är kända för våra influenseraktiviteter, men samtidigt är vi mycket
   fokuserade på att hitta andra digitala kanaler för att driva kvalitativ
   trafik. TradeDoubler har spelat en viktig roll i avseendet att testa
   nya kanaler och i slutändan nå nya publikgrupper som vi inte skulle nå
   via våra egna kanaler.

   Plan.Net Performance heeft onlangs het IKEA DE-programma gemigreerd
   naar Tradedoubler. De migratie is zonder problemen en op tijd verwerkt.
   We waren blij dat de migratie geen negatief effect had op de

   het proactieve accountbeheer en de betrokkenheid van publishers
   gedurende het hele proces.

   Sinds we het attributie model hebben geïntegreerd met Tradedoubler,
   hebben we positieve feedback gekregen. We analyseerden dat veel
   partners, die niet in het laatste clickmodel voorkwamen, profiteren van
   het nieuwe model. Al met al is het een groot voordeel voor de partners
   en voor ons. We gaan dit attributiemodel in meer landen uitrollen.

   In de eerste twee jaar heeft NA-KD een grote groei gezien, niet alleen
   in ons thuisland Zweden, maar ook internationaal. Wij staan bekend om
   onze influencer activiteiten maar daarnaast zijn wij ook gefocussed om
   de beste digitale kanalen te vinden, die kwalitatieve traffic kan
   genereren. Tradedoubler heeft daarin een belangrijke rol gespeeld door
   het testen van nieuwe kanalen waarbij ze nieuwe doelgroepen hebben
   kunnen aanspreken. Dit hadden wij niet gekund via onze eigen kanalen.

   Firma Plan.Net Performance niedawno przeniosła program IKEA DE do firmy
   Tradedoubler.  Migracja przebiegła terminowo i bez żadnych problemów.
   Cieszyliśmy się, że migracja nie wpłynęła nawet w najmniejszym stopniu
   negatywnie na przychody z programu – była wręcz korzystna, co udało się
   osiągnąć dzięki proaktywnej współpracy z klientami oraz ponownemu
   zaangażowaniu wydawców w czasie trwania procesu oraz po jego
   zakończeniu.

   Od kiedy zintegrowaliśmy model atrybucji podróży klienta dzięki firmie
   Tradedoubler otrzymujemy w pełni pozytywne informacje zwrotne. Z
   naszych danych wynika, że szereg partnerów, którzy nie byli brani pod
   uwagę w ostatnim modelu opartym na kliknięciach, czerpie korzyści z
   nowego rozwiązania. Jest to zatem niezwykle korzystne dla nas i dla
   naszych parterów, a co za tym idzie model atrybucji będziemy wdrażać na
   kolejnych rynkach.

   Przez ostatnich 10 lat współpracowałem z Tradedoubler w różnych firmach
   i krajach. Udało im się osiągnąć to, co moim zdaniem jest
   najtrudniejszym elementem usług, jakie oferuje sieć afiliacyjna.
   Tradedoubler to prawdziwy partner, któremu zależy na sukcesie klienta i
   który traktuje jego cele jak własne.

   Tradedoubler posiada know-how i partnerów, których pomoc jest niezbędna

   W Traventia chcieliśmy wypróbować kanał afiliacyjny, a na partnera
   wybraliśmy firmę Tradedoubler. Jesteśmy bardzo zadowoleni z wyników,
   jako że w zeszłym roku nasze obroty wzrosły o 400% dzięki doskonałej
   współpracy i zaangażowaniu obu partnerów – Traventia i Tradedoubler.

   Oprócz wysokiej jakości kontaktów z klientami oraz sprzedaży
   generowanej przez niszowych wydawców, cieszy mnie fakt, że dzięki
   rozwiązaniu Display mogę także dotrzeć do nowych odbiorców. Wyniki były
   pozytywne i przedstawione w formie przyjaznych dla oka zestawień.

   100% na wydajność i dysponującą własną siecią wydawców. Od 2013 r.
   wypracowaliśmy sobie pozycję pierwszej agencji medialnej w Hiszpanii
   oferującej tego rodzaju rozwiązanie. Dzisiaj z powodzeniem obsługujemy
   szereg klientów z branży finansów, ubezpieczeń, motoryzacji, handlu
   detalicznego i telekomunikacji. Pragniemy podkreślić jakość usług

   W pierwszych dwóch latach działalności NA-KD osiągnęła znaczny wzrost
   nie tylko w swojej ojczystej Szwecji, lecz także w innych krajach.
   Jesteśmy znani z naszych działań marketingowych z udziałem
   influencerów, a jednocześnie aktywnie poszukujemy właściwych kanałów
   cyfrowych, które pozwolą nam zwiększyć ruch pod względem jakościowym.
   Tradedoubler odegrał ważną rolę w testowaniu nowych kanałów,
   umożliwiając nam z czasem dotarcie do nowych odbiorców, do których nie
   dotarlibyśmy za pośrednictwem własnych kanałów.
