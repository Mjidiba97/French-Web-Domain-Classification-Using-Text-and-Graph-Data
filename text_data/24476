   1. What are cookies?

   Cookies are text files that are placed and stored on the hard drive of
   your terminal (computer, Smartphone, tablet or any other device that
   can be used to browse the internet) by a website server.

   Some of these cookies are required to access some site functionalities.
   Others are used to record statistics and site visit figures (number of
   visitors to each page, geographical origin of the devices used to visit
   the site, etc.) and statistics concerning the consultation and use of
   various elements present on the site (sections and content browsed,
   duration of visit, etc.). They can also be used to provide additional
   services such as the sharing of content on a website via social
   networking sites.

   You are not obliged to accept the use of cookies and can choose to
   refuse them by changing your internet browser settings, as explained
   below.

   To read more about cookies:
     * CNIL website (in French)
     * http://www.aboutcookies.org/


   2. Cookies present on Alstom's internet sites

   Especially on the following ones:

   www.alstom.com
   www.foundation.alstom.com
   www.partners.alstom.com

   Functionality cookies or strictly necessary cookies:

   Depending on regulations, these cookies can be placed on your digital
   device without user consent. They are essential for browsing our
   websites or strictly necessary to provide a service expressly requested
   by the user. We recommend that you do not delete those cookies as this
   may hamper browsing.

   Analytical cookies

   These cookies enable us to monitor the use and performance of our
   websites, establish statistics, number of visitors and the use of
   various site elements (which pages or sections are consulted the most
   often, which articles are read the most, etc.) to ensure that our
   services are as interesting and user-friendly as possible.

   These cookies are mostly set by Alstom. Being third-party cookies, they
   are not saved by us. We therefore suggest that you read the websites of
   these third parties to find out more about the saved cookies and how
   they are managed.

   You can refuse these cookies at any time by changing your browser
   settings as indicated below.

   Sharing cookies (social links)

   Our sites contain links to Facebook, Twitter and other similar social
   media sites that enable you to share the content of our websites with
   other people via social media. When you use these share buttons, a
   third-party cookie is installed.

   If you are connected to a social media site when browsing our websites,
   the share button will allow you to link the content viewed to your
   social media user account. If you do not want the social media site to
   link the information gathered through our sites to your user account,
   you will need to log out of the social media site first.

   In any case, you can also refuse these cookies by changing your browser
   settings as described below.

   Please read the privacy policies of these social media sites to ensure
   that you are aware of your rights and the usage purposes, in particular
   advertising, of browsing information they may collect via these
   application buttons.

   Advertising cookies

   A third-party advertising cookie is set by the server of a domain
   separate from that of the visited site. The most common advertising
   third-party cookies are generally those used by media sales agencies.

   Advertising third-party cookies are used to monitor a network of sites.
   For example, they are used to collect information about how visitors
   use a website and can be used to “recognise” an internet user on a
   number of different sites. In this case, the network management cookie
   is set or used from the pages of each site through the use of a tag.

   We use the following types of cookies on our website (this list was
   drawn up in August 2014. It is subject to change over time. Please
   consult the cookies section in your navigator parameters regularly):

       What's this you wonder? Today, in beautiful Malaga, Spain, we have
       presented the latest innovation in our proven range of ground-based
       recharging systems: SRS dedicated to electric buses. The premiere,
       as part of the #PALOMA pilot project currently underway, sees a
       prototype of SRS for e-buses operating at a bus stop in front of
       the University of Malaga’s School of Industrial Engineering. It is
       equipped with a 200kW charger and is associated with 12m Linkker
       e-bus which is running on Bus Line 1, operated by EMT, the local
       transport operator.

   Bremervörde, 16 September 2018 - It was a world premiere being
   celebrated by Alstom, one of Europe’s largest railway manufacturers,
   the Minister of Economy and Transport of Lower Saxony, the Federal
   Ministry of Transport and the transport authorities of
   Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft Niedersachsen (LNVG) and Eisenbahnen und
   Verkehrsbetriebe Elbe-Weser (EVB) in Bremervörde on Sunday 16
   September. Before the many guests and members of the press from Germany
   and abroad, the world’s first hydrogen fuel cell train rolled into the
   station. The Coradia iLint, built by Alstom in Salzgitter, Germany, is
   equipped with fuel cells which convert hydrogen and oxygen into
   electricity, thus eliminating pollutant emissions related to
   propulsion. From 17 September onwards, two such trains will enter
   commercial service according to a fixed timetable in Lower Saxony.

   For the time being, it is travellers in EVB’s Elbe-Weser network who
   can look forward to a world-first journey on the low-noise,
   zero-emission trains that reach up to 140 km/h. On behalf of LNVG, the
   Coradia iLint trains will be operated on nearly 100km of line running
   between Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven, Bremervörde and Buxtehude, replacing
   EVB’s existing diesel fleet. The new trains will be fuelled at a mobile
   hydrogen filling station. The gaseous hydrogen will be pumped into the
   trains from a 40-foot-high steel container next to the tracks at
   Bremervörde station. With one tank, they can run throughout the network
   the whole day, thanks to a total autonomy of 1000 km. A stationary
   filling station on EVB premises is scheduled to go into operation in
   2021, when Alstom will deliver a further 14 Coradia iLint trains to
   LNVG.

   "This is a revolution for Alstom and for the future of mobility. The
   world’s first hydrogen fuel cell train is entering passenger service
   and is ready for serial production,” emphasises Henri Poupart-Lafarge,
   Chairman and CEO of Alstom. “The Coradia iLint heralds a new era in
   emission-free rail transport. It is an innovation that results from
   French-German teamwork and exemplifies successful cross-border
   cooperation.”

   Dr. Bernd Althusmann, Lower Saxony’s Minister of Economy and Transport,
   whose department has supported LNVG’s purchase of another 14 hydrogen
   trains with more than €81 million, is impressed: “With the test
   operation starting today, Lower Saxony is performing real pioneering
   work in local transport in cooperation with Alstom and EVB. The
   emission-free drive technology of the Coradia iLint provides a
   climate-friendly alternative to conventional diesel trains,
   particularly on non-electrified lines,” he explains. “In successfully
   proving the operability of the fuel cell technology in daily service,
   we will set the course for rail transport to be largely operated
   climate-friendly and emission-free in the future. The state government
   of Lower Saxony is proud of putting this trendsetting project on the
   track together with LNVG.”

   The federal government has actively supported the development and
   testing of the new drive technology in Lower Saxony by providing funds
   from the National Innovation Programme for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell
   Technology.

   Enak Ferlemann, Federal Government Commissioner for Rail Transport and
   Parliamentary State Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Transport and
   Digital Infrastructure, puts it in a nutshell: “A world premiere in
   Germany. We are putting the first passenger train with fuel cell
   technology on the track. This is a strong sign for the mobility of the
   future. Hydrogen is a real, low-emission and efficient alternative to
   diesel. These trains can be operated cleanly and in an environmentally
   friendly way, especially on secondary lines where overhead lines are
   uneconomical or not available yet.” He added: “We therefore support and
   fund this technology, in order to expand it.”

   For LNVG chief Carmen Schwabl, whose authority organizes the rail
   passenger transport between the North Sea and the Harz mountains and
   therefore pays annual compensation of around €300 million to the
   railway companies, the entry to fuel cell technology is also a
   strategic decision. She sees LNVG in a national pioneering role: “With
   the two Coradia iLint trains and with the use of another 14 hydrogen
   trains from the end of 2021, we are the first passenger rail transport
   authority to replace existing diesel vehicles by emission-free
   vehicles, thus contributing better to the fulfilment of the climate
   protection goals.” LNVG’s Managing Director looks further into the
   future: “We also do this because about 120 diesel trainsets in our
   vehicle pool will reach the end of their lifetime within the next 30
   years, meaning we will have to replace them. The experience gained with
   this project helps us find a sustainable and practical solution.”

   With around 2 million rail passengers and around 4 million bus
   passengers per year, EVB figures among the largest mobility providers
   in the Elbe-Weser triangle. The traditional company, which boasts a
   history of more than 100 years and around 550 employees, is looking
   forward to the “train of the future”.  Dr. Marcel Frank, Managing
   Director of EVB, emphasizes: “It is a great milestone that we will use
   the world’s first hydrogen-powered train in our Elbe-Weser network in
   passenger service between Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven, Bremervörde and
   Buxtehude, not only for the region and for us, but also for passenger
   rail transport worldwide. For EVB, this is the entry to emission-free
   mobility.”

   1. What are cookies?

   Cookies are text files that are placed and stored on the hard drive of
   your terminal (computer, Smartphone, tablet or any other device that
   can be used to browse the internet) by a website server.

   Some of these cookies are required to access some site functionalities.
   Others are used to record statistics and site visit figures (number of
   visitors to each page, geographical origin of the devices used to visit
   the site, etc.) and statistics concerning the consultation and use of
   various elements present on the site (sections and content browsed,
   duration of visit, etc.). They can also be used to provide additional
   services such as the sharing of content on a website via social
   networking sites.

   You are not obliged to accept the use of cookies and can choose to
   refuse them by changing your internet browser settings, as explained
   below.

   often, which articles are read the most, etc.) to ensure that our

   These cookies are mostly set by Alstom. Being third-party cookies, they
   are not saved by us. We therefore suggest that you read the websites of

   separate from that of the visited site. The most common advertising
   third-party cookies are generally those used by media sales agencies.

   Advertising third-party cookies are used to monitor a network of sites.
   For example, they are used to collect information about how visitors
   use a website and can be used to “recognise” an internet user on a
   number of different sites. In this case, the network management cookie
   is set or used from the pages of each site through the use of a tag.

       What's this you wonder? Today, in beautiful Malaga, Spain, we have
       presented the latest innovation in our proven range of ground-based
       recharging systems: SRS dedicated to electric buses. The premiere,
       as part of the #PALOMA pilot project currently underway, sees a
       prototype of SRS for e-buses operating at a bus stop in front of
       the University of Malaga’s School of Industrial Engineering. It is
       equipped with a 200kW charger and is associated with 12m Linkker
       e-bus which is running on Bus Line 1, operated by EMT, the local
       transport operator.

       developments in sustainable mobility and promote local initiatives
       to support everyone in reducing their environmental footprint. We

   Bremervörde, 16 September 2018 - It was a world premiere being
   celebrated by Alstom, one of Europe’s largest railway manufacturers,
   the Minister of Economy and Transport of Lower Saxony, the Federal
   Ministry of Transport and the transport authorities of
   Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft Niedersachsen (LNVG) and Eisenbahnen und
   Verkehrsbetriebe Elbe-Weser (EVB) in Bremervörde on Sunday 16
   September. Before the many guests and members of the press from Germany
   and abroad, the world’s first hydrogen fuel cell train rolled into the
   station. The Coradia iLint, built by Alstom in Salzgitter, Germany, is
   equipped with fuel cells which convert hydrogen and oxygen into
   electricity, thus eliminating pollutant emissions related to
   propulsion. From 17 September onwards, two such trains will enter
   commercial service according to a fixed timetable in Lower Saxony.

   For the time being, it is travellers in EVB’s Elbe-Weser network who
   can look forward to a world-first journey on the low-noise,
   zero-emission trains that reach up to 140 km/h. On behalf of LNVG, the
   Coradia iLint trains will be operated on nearly 100km of line running
   between Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven, Bremervörde and Buxtehude, replacing
   EVB’s existing diesel fleet. The new trains will be fuelled at a mobile
   hydrogen filling station. The gaseous hydrogen will be pumped into the
   trains from a 40-foot-high steel container next to the tracks at
   Bremervörde station. With one tank, they can run throughout the network
   the whole day, thanks to a total autonomy of 1000 km. A stationary
   filling station on EVB premises is scheduled to go into operation in
   2021, when Alstom will deliver a further 14 Coradia iLint trains to
   LNVG.

   "This is a revolution for Alstom and for the future of mobility. The
   world’s first hydrogen fuel cell train is entering passenger service
   and is ready for serial production,” emphasises Henri Poupart-Lafarge,
   Chairman and CEO of Alstom. “The Coradia iLint heralds a new era in
   emission-free rail transport. It is an innovation that results from
   French-German teamwork and exemplifies successful cross-border
   cooperation.”

   Dr. Bernd Althusmann, Lower Saxony’s Minister of Economy and Transport,
   whose department has supported LNVG’s purchase of another 14 hydrogen
   trains with more than €81 million, is impressed: “With the test
   operation starting today, Lower Saxony is performing real pioneering
   work in local transport in cooperation with Alstom and EVB. The
   emission-free drive technology of the Coradia iLint provides a
   climate-friendly alternative to conventional diesel trains,
   particularly on non-electrified lines,” he explains. “In successfully
   proving the operability of the fuel cell technology in daily service,
   we will set the course for rail transport to be largely operated
   climate-friendly and emission-free in the future. The state government
   of Lower Saxony is proud of putting this trendsetting project on the
   track together with LNVG.”

   The federal government has actively supported the development and
   testing of the new drive technology in Lower Saxony by providing funds
   from the National Innovation Programme for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell
   Technology.

   Enak Ferlemann, Federal Government Commissioner for Rail Transport and
   Parliamentary State Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Transport and
   Digital Infrastructure, puts it in a nutshell: “A world premiere in
   Germany. We are putting the first passenger train with fuel cell
   technology on the track. This is a strong sign for the mobility of the
   future. Hydrogen is a real, low-emission and efficient alternative to
   diesel. These trains can be operated cleanly and in an environmentally
   friendly way, especially on secondary lines where overhead lines are
   uneconomical or not available yet.” He added: “We therefore support and
   fund this technology, in order to expand it.”

   For LNVG chief Carmen Schwabl, whose authority organizes the rail
   passenger transport between the North Sea and the Harz mountains and
   therefore pays annual compensation of around €300 million to the
   railway companies, the entry to fuel cell technology is also a
   strategic decision. She sees LNVG in a national pioneering role: “With
   the two Coradia iLint trains and with the use of another 14 hydrogen
   trains from the end of 2021, we are the first passenger rail transport
   authority to replace existing diesel vehicles by emission-free
   vehicles, thus contributing better to the fulfilment of the climate
   protection goals.” LNVG’s Managing Director looks further into the
   future: “We also do this because about 120 diesel trainsets in our
   vehicle pool will reach the end of their lifetime within the next 30
   years, meaning we will have to replace them. The experience gained with
   this project helps us find a sustainable and practical solution.”

   With around 2 million rail passengers and around 4 million bus
   passengers per year, EVB figures among the largest mobility providers
   in the Elbe-Weser triangle. The traditional company, which boasts a
   history of more than 100 years and around 550 employees, is looking
   forward to the “train of the future”.  Dr. Marcel Frank, Managing
   Director of EVB, emphasizes: “It is a great milestone that we will use
   the world’s first hydrogen-powered train in our Elbe-Weser network in
   passenger service between Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven, Bremervörde and
   Buxtehude, not only for the region and for us, but also for passenger
   rail transport worldwide. For EVB, this is the entry to emission-free
   mobility.”

   1. Définition d’un cookie

   Les cookies (ou témoins de connexion) sont des fichiers textes qui sont
   placés et stockés sur le disque dur de votre terminal (ordinateur,
   smartphone, tablette ou tout autre appareil permettant de naviguer sur
   Internet) par le serveur d’un site Internet.

   Certains de ces cookies sont nécessaires voire indispensables pour
   accéder à certaines fonctionnalités d’un site. D’autres permettent par
   exemple d'établir des statistiques et volumes de fréquentation (nombre
   de visiteurs sur chaque page, origine géographique des supports
   utilisés pour visiter le site…) et des statistiques sur la consultation
   et l’utilisation des divers éléments composant le site (rubriques et
   contenus visités, durée de la visite…). Ils permettent aussi d’apporter
   des services additionnels tels que par exemple le partage de contenus
   présents sur un site Internet via les réseaux sociaux.

   A aucun moment l’utilisation de cookies ne vous est imposée et vous
   pouvez à tout moment refuser leur utilisation en paramétrant votre
   navigateur Internet, comme expliqué ci-dessous.

   Pour plus d’informations sur les cookies :
     * Site de la CNIL
     * http://www.aboutcookies.org/ (en anglais)


   2. Les cookies présents sur les sites internet d’Alstom

   Et plus particulièrement sur les sites suivants :

   www.alstom.com
   www.foundation.alstom.com
   www.partners.alstom.com

   Cookies de fonctionnalités ou strictement nécessaires au site:

   Selon la réglementation, ces cookies sont exemptés du recueil du
   consentement de l’utilisateur. En effet, ils sont indispensables à la
   navigation sur nos sites ou strictement nécessaires à la fourniture
   d'un service expressément demandé par l'utilisateur. Leur surpression
   peut entrainer des difficultés de navigation. Nous vous déconseillons
   de les supprimer.

   Cookies analytiques

   Il s'agit de cookies qui nous permettent de connaître l'utilisation et
   les performances de nos sites, d’établir des statistiques, des volumes
   de fréquentation et d’utilisation des divers éléments de nos sites (les
   pages ou les rubriques les plus souvent consultées, les articles les
   plus lus…) afin d’améliorer l’intérêt et l’ergonomie de nos services.

   Il s'agit principalement de cookies émis par Alstom. S’agissant des
   cookies tiers, ils ne sont pas enregistrés par nous. Par conséquent,
   nous vous suggérons de consulter les sites internet de ces tiers pour
   plus d'informations sur les cookies enregistrés et la gestion de
   ceux-ci.

   Vous pouvez en tout état de cause refuser ces cookies par un
   paramétrage approprié de votre navigateur, comme indiqué ci-dessous.

   Cookies de partage (liens sociaux)

   Nos sites contiennent des liens de partage vers Facebook, Twitter et
   autre réseau social similaire, qui vous permettent de partager les
   contenus de nos sites avec d’autres personnes via les réseaux sociaux.
   Lorsque vous utilisez ces boutons de partage, un cookie tiers est
   installé.

   Si vous êtes connectés à un réseau social lors de votre navigation sur
   nos sites, les boutons de partage permettent de relier les contenus
   consultés à votre compte utilisateur sur le réseau social. Si vous ne
   souhaitez pas que le réseau social relie les informations collectées
   par l'intermédiaire de nos sites à votre compte utilisateur, vous devez
   auparavant vous déconnecter du réseau social.

   Vous pouvez également en tout état de cause refuser ces cookies par un
   paramétrage approprié de votre navigateur, comme indiqué ci-dessous.

   Nous vous invitons enfin à consulter les politiques de protection de la
   vie privée de ces réseaux sociaux afin de prendre connaissance de vos
   droits et des finalités d'utilisation, notamment publicitaires, des
   informations de navigation qu'ils peuvent recueillir grâce à ces
   boutons applicatifs.

   Cookies publicitaires

   Un cookie publicitaire tiers est un cookie placé par le serveur d’un
   domaine distinct de celui du site visité. Les cookies publicitaires
   tiers les plus fréquents sont généralement ceux utilisés par les régies
   publicitaires.
   Ils permettent un suivi sur un réseau de sites. Ils sont par exemple
   utilisés pour le ciblage comportemental, car ils permettent de
   "reconnaître" un internaute sur un ensemble de sites distincts. Dans ce
   cas, le cookie du gestionnaire de réseau est placé ou utilisé à partir
   des pages de chaque site par l’intermédiaire d’un tag.

   Les cookies suivants sont utilisés sur nos sites (cette liste a été
   établie en Août 2014. Elle est susceptible d’évoluer dans le temps ;
   nous vous invitons à consulter régulièrement la section cookies dans
   les paramètres de votre navigateur):

       What's this you wonder? Today, in beautiful Malaga, Spain, we have
       presented the latest innovation in our proven range of ground-based
       recharging systems: SRS dedicated to electric buses. The premiere,
       as part of the #PALOMA pilot project currently underway, sees a
       prototype of SRS for e-buses operating at a bus stop in front of
       the University of Malaga’s School of Industrial Engineering. It is
       equipped with a 200kW charger and is associated with 12m Linkker
       e-bus which is running on Bus Line 1, operated by EMT, the local
       transport operator.

       In order to raise awareness on #sustainable #mobility in our
       business activities and everyday life, we organized Sustainable
       Mobility Days as part of the European #mobilityweek at Alstom. On
       many sites, activities were held to focus on the latest
       developments in sustainable mobility and promote local initiatives
       to support everyone in reducing their environmental footprint. We
       just love these inspiring drawings of children done on our site in
       Belfort, France!
