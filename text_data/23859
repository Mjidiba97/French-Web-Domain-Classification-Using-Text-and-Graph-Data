   Biography. Born in Tienen, Belgium, too long ago. Grew up in Tienen and
   went to the University of Leuven (Belgium). Got married to Bea. Studied
   for two years at Osaka University (Japan). Obtained a Ph.D. degree from
   the University of Texas in 1976 under the supervision of Terry Wagner,
   with a thesis entitled Nonparametric Discrimination and Density
   Estimation. Joined the School of Computer Science at McGill University
   in 1977 as a young snotnose. Recognized by his peers as a slum dog in
   2008, an inglorious basterd in 2009, an artist in 2012, and a gentleman
   / wolf in 2013. Thanks to a wonderful bunch of students and colleagues
   all over the world, still hanging in there. Will never retire. Read
   this piece by Julius Grey, this piece by Julius Grey and L.-M.
   Casgrain, and this quote by Walter Crowley to understand Luc, and
   listen to Jeremy Rifkin to worry with him. He supports fundamental
   research following the model of Daniel Zajfman and Weizmann Institute.

       2018-2019 academic year. I will start up my tractor again for COMP
       252 in January 2020.
     * Undergraduate roughage on data structures and algorithms: COMP
       251B. I will not be out in this yard during the academic year
       2019-2020.
     * Graduate oats on probabilistic analysis of algorithms: COMP 690.
       (These juicy bits are available every year in the Fall term,
       including in September 2019.)
