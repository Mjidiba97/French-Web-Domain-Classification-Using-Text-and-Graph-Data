Instagram star isn't what she seems. But brands are buying in

   by Kaya Yurieff   @kyurieff June 25, 2018: 11:23 AM ET

   This Instagram star isn't real, but brands don't seem to care
   This Instagram star isn't real, but brands don't seem to care

Like many social media infuencers, "Lil Miquela" posts photos of herself
wearing high-end designer clothing with cleverly crafted captions.

   She wears clothes from companies like Proenza Schouler, Coach and
   Balenciaga, and recommends hair products from OUAI for "keeping my
   strands silky smooth." She has more than 1 million followers -- most of
   whom are Millennials and Gen Zers.

   Miquela also voices support for social causes like Black Lives Matter
   and has partnered with Prada on a campaign for Milan Fashion Week.
   She's even released a few songs on Spotify (SPOT).

   Since launching her Instagram account in 2016, the 19-year-old model
   from Downey, California, has become increasingly recognizable on social
   media. Her dark brown hair is often styled in double buns. She has
   freckles, brown eyes, bangs cut straight across her forehead, and goes
   to popular events like the music festival Coachella.
   lil miquela main A photo of Miquela from her Instagram page.

   But in April, she made a confession.

   "I am not a human being," she wrote in an Instagram post. "I'm a
   robot."

   Miquela is a CGI -- or computer generated image -- created by a Los
   Angeles-based startup called Brud. The company specializes in
   artificial inteligence and robotics. According to TechCrunch, Brud is
   backed by venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital, BoxGroup and SV
   Angel. Sequoia Capital declined to comment on whether they're connected
   to Brud. BoxGroup and SV Angel did not respond to a request for
   comment.

   Miquela is a part of an emerging group of "fake" virtual influencers,
   including Bermuda, Blawko and Shudu, who's known as the world's first
   "digital" supermodel. Like Miquela, Blawko is a creation of Brud. (The
   company is reportedly behind Bermuda, too). A fashion photographer
   named Cameron-James Wilson is behind Shudu, who has over 120,000
   followers.

   Like human social influencers, these CGI accounts often promote brands
   and products. But it's unclear if any posts have been paid for by
   sponsors. Brud declined multiple requests for comment on this story.

   In at least one case, Brud is profiting. Lifestyle news site
   Highsnobiety collaborated with Miquela on an $80 patterned shirt.
   According to a spokesperson for the brand, Miquela's team receives a
   cut of the profits if the item is purchased from her online store, but
   not on the Highsnobiety site.

   The concept of advertising via CGI influencers raises questions: How
   can they promote products they can't try? Should companies and brands
   be transparent about creating or using virtual influencers?

   "There's room for consumers to be confused -- and this should be
   [remedied]," said Olivier Toubia, a marketing professor at Columbia
   Business School.

   Toubia says CGI influencers should have a "transparent relationship"
   with their followers about sponsorship deals, and it should be clear
   "who is real and who is not real."

   Jennifer Grygiel, a social media professor at Syracuse University's
   Newhouse School, agrees.

   "It's not obvious [she's a CGI], and it's not obvious on the post
   level," said Grygiel, calling this concept "deeply problematic."

   "When I was growing up, at least we knew Barbie was a doll," she said.
   "For over two years now, there could be people, teenagers especially,
   who thought [Miquela] maybe was a person," she said. "We need the
   brands to disclose. We also need these companies to help so they're not
   facilitating and participating in this mass deception."

   But some advocates argue that being completely transparent about a CGI
   influencer's identity isn't necessary, that it's obvious these aren't
   real people and that actual humans edit themselves with Photoshop, too.

   "How much do you see on Instagram that is authentic?" said Yoon Ahn,
   co-designer of the Ambush brand, which has worked with Miquela on an
   unpaid post. "How many Instagram models got surgically enhanced [and]
   are selling things? It's the same thing, isn't it? It's not real."

   "Those products didn't make that kind of hair. Those products didn't
   make those kind of lips," she added.

   Ryan Detert, CEO of Influential, an AI-enabled influencer marketing
   platform, views it as an authenticity issue, rather than an ethics one.

   "Mannequins have been around for the last 100 years, and those are
   things in the store to sell beauty and to sell an ideal. So I think
   it's not much different than that," he said.

Why CGIs are attractive to brands

   So what's in it for brands? Virtual influencers can be particularly
   appealing to companies, according to Influential's Detert. It can be
   less risky than partnering with a person because there is more control
   over the image.

   "Assuming the design team can design quickly enough, they will always
   be able to post the right thing at the right time with the right angle
   that the brand wants," he said.

   There won't be issues in a CGI's past that could get the brand in
   trouble, such as criminal history or use of profanity, Detert added.
   It's also a way for companies to show they're creative and on the
   cutting edge of technology.

   Tyler Haney, CEO of Outdoor Voices, said her company likes to be
   "experimental" when speaking to an audience about the brand. Miquela
   posted photos of herself wearing an athletic dress by Outdoor Voices as
   part of a recent campaign.

   Haney began following Miquela on Instagram and originally didn't know
   she was a CGI. She was later connected to Brud through an investor.
   Haney wanted to partner with her even though she learned she wasn't
   human.

   "We're constantly thinking about ways we can use tech to create a more
   interesting, engaged customer experience," Haney said. "I enjoy finding
   cool and interesting ways to bring product to life."

   Other brands, such as Barneys, don't seem to mind Miquela isn't real,
   either. Marissa Rosenblum, VP of content at Barneys New York, told
   CNNMoney the company was interested in reaching Miquela's audience of
   Gen Zers and didn't partner with her solely because she's a CGI.

   Experts believe we'll see more of these CGIs in the future.

   "More and more, people might start blurring the line between AI and
   human," Detert said.

Brand interest and guidelines

   Through social media stars, brands can reach specific, niche audiences
   in a more authentic way compared to traditional advertising.

   "One of the big benefits is trust," Columbia's Toubia said. "People
   tend to trust recommendations from people more than they trust brands
   or advertising or commercials."

   The Federal Trade Commission has guidelines for human social
   influencers endorsing products. But these rules should apply to CGIs
   too, the agency told CNNMoney.

   "The FTC doesn't have specific guidance on CGI influencers, but
   advertisers using CGI influencer posts should ensure that the posts are
   clearly identifiable as advertising," said an FTC spokesperson.

   This means social media posts should have a disclosure, such as "#ad"
   or "#sponsored" if the company is paying you to promote something. The
   FTC also advises influencers to make disclosures if they receive items
   for free.

   Brands can be subject to fines if guidelines aren't followed.

Issues of transparency

   For early creators, such as photographer Cameron-James Wilson, not
   being upfront about the CGI influencer's true identity was part of the
   mystery, and contributed to the hype and intrigue.
   shudu gram A photo of Shudu "wearing" a lipstick from singer Rihanna's
   Fenty Beauty line.

   His creation Shudu appeared so lifelike that Semhal Nasreddin -- the
   creator of clothing line SOULSKY -- thought Shudu was a promising
   up-and-coming model from Africa. Last year, Nasreddin reached out to
   Shudu and sent her a free shirt to promote.

   It wasn't until a few months ago that Wilson admitted to Nasreddin that
   Shudu wasn't real.

   "I thought she was a real emerging person with incredible potential,"
   Nasreddin said. "As you can imagine, it was a surprise to me [when I
   found out]. She just looked so real, which is a credit to how good his
   artwork is ... and a tribute to how far the technology has come."

   But Nasreddin, whose background is Ethiopian and Eritrean, said she
   didn't feel deceived by Wilson.

   "I feel like he represented her image in a dignified way," she said.
   "There was nothing exploitative about it, or demeaning, or anything
   negative behind it."

   Wilson told CNNMoney he has not yet participated in any paid deals with
   Shudu. He didn't immediately disclose she wasn't real because he wanted
   to see if people would think she's human. Now, Shudu's Instagram
   profile page says "Shudu Gram World's First Digital Supermodel."

   "When you're doing 3D, for people to be convinced that what you're
   doing is real, is a major thing," said Wilson, calling her a form of
   art.

   But when asked whether or not Wilson would hide a CGI's identity from
   followers again, he said: "Absolutely not."

   Work Transformed

Instagram star isn't what she seems. But brands are buying in

   by Kaya Yurieff   @kyurieff June 25, 2018: 11:23 AM ET

   This Instagram star isn't real, but brands don't seem to care
   This Instagram star isn't real, but brands don't seem to care

Like many social media infuencers, "Lil Miquela" posts photos of herself
wearing high-end designer clothing with cleverly crafted captions.

   She wears clothes from companies like Proenza Schouler, Coach and
   Balenciaga, and recommends hair products from OUAI for "keeping my
   strands silky smooth." She has more than 1 million followers -- most of
   whom are Millennials and Gen Zers.

   Miquela also voices support for social causes like Black Lives Matter
   and has partnered with Prada on a campaign for Milan Fashion Week.
   She's even released a few songs on Spotify (SPOT).

   Since launching her Instagram account in 2016, the 19-year-old model
   from Downey, California, has become increasingly recognizable on social
   media. Her dark brown hair is often styled in double buns. She has
   freckles, brown eyes, bangs cut straight across her forehead, and goes
   to popular events like the music festival Coachella.
   lil miquela main A photo of Miquela from her Instagram page.

   But in April, she made a confession.

   "I am not a human being," she wrote in an Instagram post. "I'm a
   robot."

   Miquela is a CGI -- or computer generated image -- created by a Los
   Angeles-based startup called Brud. The company specializes in
   artificial inteligence and robotics. According to TechCrunch, Brud is
   backed by venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital, BoxGroup and SV
   Angel. Sequoia Capital declined to comment on whether they're connected
   to Brud. BoxGroup and SV Angel did not respond to a request for
   comment.

   Miquela is a part of an emerging group of "fake" virtual influencers,
   including Bermuda, Blawko and Shudu, who's known as the world's first
   "digital" supermodel. Like Miquela, Blawko is a creation of Brud. (The
   company is reportedly behind Bermuda, too). A fashion photographer
   named Cameron-James Wilson is behind Shudu, who has over 120,000
   followers.

   Like human social influencers, these CGI accounts often promote brands
   and products. But it's unclear if any posts have been paid for by
   sponsors. Brud declined multiple requests for comment on this story.

   In at least one case, Brud is profiting. Lifestyle news site
   Highsnobiety collaborated with Miquela on an $80 patterned shirt.
   According to a spokesperson for the brand, Miquela's team receives a
   cut of the profits if the item is purchased from her online store, but
   not on the Highsnobiety site.

   The concept of advertising via CGI influencers raises questions: How
   can they promote products they can't try? Should companies and brands
   be transparent about creating or using virtual influencers?

   "There's room for consumers to be confused -- and this should be
   [remedied]," said Olivier Toubia, a marketing professor at Columbia
   Business School.

   Toubia says CGI influencers should have a "transparent relationship"
   with their followers about sponsorship deals, and it should be clear
   "who is real and who is not real."

   Jennifer Grygiel, a social media professor at Syracuse University's
   Newhouse School, agrees.

   "It's not obvious [she's a CGI], and it's not obvious on the post
   level," said Grygiel, calling this concept "deeply problematic."

   "When I was growing up, at least we knew Barbie was a doll," she said.
   "For over two years now, there could be people, teenagers especially,
   who thought [Miquela] maybe was a person," she said. "We need the
   brands to disclose. We also need these companies to help so they're not
   facilitating and participating in this mass deception."

   But some advocates argue that being completely transparent about a CGI
   influencer's identity isn't necessary, that it's obvious these aren't
   real people and that actual humans edit themselves with Photoshop, too.

   "How much do you see on Instagram that is authentic?" said Yoon Ahn,
   co-designer of the Ambush brand, which has worked with Miquela on an
   unpaid post. "How many Instagram models got surgically enhanced [and]
   are selling things? It's the same thing, isn't it? It's not real."

   "Those products didn't make that kind of hair. Those products didn't
   make those kind of lips," she added.

   Ryan Detert, CEO of Influential, an AI-enabled influencer marketing
   platform, views it as an authenticity issue, rather than an ethics one.

   "Mannequins have been around for the last 100 years, and those are
   things in the store to sell beauty and to sell an ideal. So I think
   it's not much different than that," he said.

Why CGIs are attractive to brands

   So what's in it for brands? Virtual influencers can be particularly
   appealing to companies, according to Influential's Detert. It can be
   less risky than partnering with a person because there is more control
   over the image.

   "Assuming the design team can design quickly enough, they will always
   be able to post the right thing at the right time with the right angle
   that the brand wants," he said.

   There won't be issues in a CGI's past that could get the brand in
   trouble, such as criminal history or use of profanity, Detert added.
   It's also a way for companies to show they're creative and on the
   cutting edge of technology.

   Tyler Haney, CEO of Outdoor Voices, said her company likes to be
   "experimental" when speaking to an audience about the brand. Miquela
   posted photos of herself wearing an athletic dress by Outdoor Voices as
   part of a recent campaign.

   Haney began following Miquela on Instagram and originally didn't know
   she was a CGI. She was later connected to Brud through an investor.
   Haney wanted to partner with her even though she learned she wasn't
   human.

   "We're constantly thinking about ways we can use tech to create a more
   interesting, engaged customer experience," Haney said. "I enjoy finding
   cool and interesting ways to bring product to life."

   Other brands, such as Barneys, don't seem to mind Miquela isn't real,
   either. Marissa Rosenblum, VP of content at Barneys New York, told
   CNNMoney the company was interested in reaching Miquela's audience of
   Gen Zers and didn't partner with her solely because she's a CGI.

   Experts believe we'll see more of these CGIs in the future.

   "More and more, people might start blurring the line between AI and
   human," Detert said.

Brand interest and guidelines

   Through social media stars, brands can reach specific, niche audiences
   in a more authentic way compared to traditional advertising.

   "One of the big benefits is trust," Columbia's Toubia said. "People
   tend to trust recommendations from people more than they trust brands
   or advertising or commercials."

   The Federal Trade Commission has guidelines for human social
   influencers endorsing products. But these rules should apply to CGIs
   too, the agency told CNNMoney.

   "The FTC doesn't have specific guidance on CGI influencers, but
   advertisers using CGI influencer posts should ensure that the posts are
   clearly identifiable as advertising," said an FTC spokesperson.

   This means social media posts should have a disclosure, such as "#ad"
   or "#sponsored" if the company is paying you to promote something. The
   FTC also advises influencers to make disclosures if they receive items
   for free.

   Brands can be subject to fines if guidelines aren't followed.

Issues of transparency

   For early creators, such as photographer Cameron-James Wilson, not
   being upfront about the CGI influencer's true identity was part of the
   mystery, and contributed to the hype and intrigue.

   His creation Shudu appeared so lifelike that Semhal Nasreddin -- the
   creator of clothing line SOULSKY -- thought Shudu was a promising
   up-and-coming model from Africa. Last year, Nasreddin reached out to
   Shudu and sent her a free shirt to promote.

   It wasn't until a few months ago that Wilson admitted to Nasreddin that
   Shudu wasn't real.

   "I thought she was a real emerging person with incredible potential,"
   Nasreddin said. "As you can imagine, it was a surprise to me [when I
   found out]. She just looked so real, which is a credit to how good his
   artwork is ... and a tribute to how far the technology has come."

   But Nasreddin, whose background is Ethiopian and Eritrean, said she
   didn't feel deceived by Wilson.

   "I feel like he represented her image in a dignified way," she said.
   "There was nothing exploitative about it, or demeaning, or anything
   negative behind it."

   Wilson told CNNMoney he has not yet participated in any paid deals with
   Shudu. He didn't immediately disclose she wasn't real because he wanted
   to see if people would think she's human. Now, Shudu's Instagram
   profile page says "Shudu Gram World's First Digital Supermodel."

   "When you're doing 3D, for people to be convinced that what you're
   doing is real, is a major thing," said Wilson, calling her a form of
   art.

   But when asked whether or not Wilson would hide a CGI's identity from
   followers again, he said: "Absolutely not."

Seven Fear & Greed Indicators

   How we calculate the index More »
   Market Volatility
   Neutral

   The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is at 19.12. This is a neutral reading
   and indicates that market risks appear low.

   Last changed Aug 15 from a Fear rating

   Updated Oct 2 at 8:00pm

   Stock Price Breadth
   Fear

   The McClellan Volume Summation Index measures advancing and declining
   volume on the NYSE. During the last month, approximately 8.94% more of
   each day's volume has traded in declining issues than in advancing
   issues, pushing this indicator towards the lower end of its range for
   the last two years.

   Last changed Oct 2 from a Neutral rating

   Updated Oct 3 at 4:06pm

   Stock Price Strength
   Fear

   The number of stocks hitting 52-week highs exceeds the number hitting
   lows but is at the lower end of its range, indicating fear.

   Last changed Sep 27 from a Neutral rating

   Updated Oct 3 at 4:02pm

   Safe Haven Demand
   Fear

   Bonds have outperformed stocks by 2.43 percentage points during the
   last 20 trading days. This is close to the weakest performance for
   stocks relative to bonds in the past two years and indicates investors
   are fleeing risky stocks for the safety of bonds.

   Last changed Oct 1 from a Greed rating

   Updated Oct 2 at 8:00pm

   Put and Call Options
   Extreme Fear

   During the last five trading days, volume in put options has lagged
   volume in call options by 23.73% as investors make bullish bets in
   their portfolios. However, this is still among the highest levels of
   put buying seen during the last two years, indicating extreme fear on
   the part of investors.

   Last changed Oct 2 from a Fear rating

   Updated Oct 3 at 4:17pm

   Market Momentum
   Extreme Fear

   The S&P 500 is slightly below its 125-day average. During the last two
   years, this index has typically been above this average, so rapid
   declines like this indicate extreme levels of fear.

   Last changed Oct 1 from a Fear rating

   Updated Oct 3 at 5:09pm

   Junk Bond Demand
   Extreme Fear

   Investors in low quality junk bonds are accepting 1.96 percentage
   points in additional yield over safer investment grade corporate bonds.
   While this spread is historically low, it is sharply higher than recent
   levels and suggests that investors are becoming more risk averse.

Uber wants to patent a way to use AI to identify drunk passengers

   by Matt McFarland   @mattmcfarland June 7, 2018: 3:14 PM ET

   A first Uber ride ends in sexual assault charge

Uber may be able to tell when you've had a few too many drinks.

   The ridesharing giant has explored identifying drunk passengers with
   artificial intelligence, according to a patent application published
   Thursday. With the technology, Uber could better tailor its ride
   options for customers.

   The patent application describes a system that learns how you typically
   use the Uber app, so that it can identify unusual behavior. The system
   relies on an algorithm to weigh a variety of factors, including typos,
   how precisely a user clicks on links and buttons, walking speed, and
   how long it takes to request a ride. The time of day, and where a ride
   is requested may also be considered.

   For example, it's a good bet that a person walking down a street at 1
   a.m. Saturday in a nightlife district while clumsily typing probably
   isn't sober.

   The patent also says that the service Uber provides to the user could
   change, as a result. Drivers may be warned of their passenger's state.
   And riders in an especially unusual state may only be matched with
   drivers with relevant experience or training, the patent application
   says.

   Passengers also might not be given the option to partake in a shared
   ride, based on their state.

   For Uber drivers, dealing with drunk passengers is a drawback of the
   job.

   "It would be cool if drivers got extra money for picking up drunk
   passengers. It's not a big deal, but it definitely gets old after about
   the 25th time," Harry Campbell, author of The RideShare Guy blog, told
   CNN Money.

   Related: 103 Uber drivers accused of sexual assault or abuse

   Other things can go wrong too. A recent CNN investigation found at
   least 103 Uber drivers in the United States who have been accused of
   sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers in the past four years.
   Many of the police reports and court documents involved passengers who
   were inebriated or drinking before getting into an Uber.

   The patent application's authors are current or former members of
   Uber's Trust & Safety team, which works to make the company's products
   safer.

   Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

   CNN reporter Sara O'Brien contributed to this report.
