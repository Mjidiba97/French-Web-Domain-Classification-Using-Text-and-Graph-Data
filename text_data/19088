Giant Eye Spy Art Piece

   [007.JPG]
   We saw this giant eye spy at our local kids museum. Isn't it great?
   What a great idea for a pre school class or playroom! This would be
   easy to do with a bunch of those photo laser stickers and a large
   thrifted tray.  Spray paint the tray white, add stickers and hang.
   Awesome!

Kids Craft: Bow & Arrow Set

   [summer+034.JPG]
   The girls are Merida crazy despite the fact we haven't seen Brave.  We
   are almost to the end of the junior novelization of the story and of
   course you can not miss all the advertisements and product hawking that
   goes into any movie these days. Lu has been asking me to make her a bow
   and arrow set for a while so...here it is! To my surprise it actually
   works. This was the lazy mommies attempt at making a bow and arrow set.
   I am sure I will be amazed when I bother to google homemade bow and
   arrow sets.  This took about 10 minutes from start to finish.  The
   paper towel tube is by far her favorite part of the set.  She is
   walking around with it on now!
   Have fun crafting with your kids! Mama King

Year End Autograph Hat

   [007.JPG]
   Tomorrow is our last Daisy meeting of the school year. Our
   last activity will be autographing hats. I just finished ironing the
   daisies on!  These should turn out cute and remind the girls of Daisies
   over the summer. The two baseball hats are leader hats.
   Hope you had a fun and relaxing Father's Day! Mama King

Strolling of the Heifers

   [105.JPG]
   The Strolling of the Heifers in Brattleboro, Vermont was everything a
   small town parade should be. There were a cast of characters, local
   clubs, homemade floats, marching bands and...cows! Approximately 100 of
   them. Not to mention donkeys, miniature horses and alpacas. The steady
   rain didn't put a damper on any ones spirits as the Fairy Cow-Mother
   and her Dairy Princesses started off the parade with tutus, umbrellas
   and rain boots. My girls were thrilled by the baby cows, stilt walkers,
   music and of course the treats being handed out along the parade route.
   Being Vermont, Dum-Dum lollipops and Tootsie Rolls were being handed
   out alongside packets of baby carrots and organic fruit snacks.
   [110.JPG] [109.JPG]
   [096.JPG]
   The parade was followed by a day of music, food and activities.  If the
   weather had cooperated it would have been the perfect day...maybe next
   year!
   The Strolling of the Heifers was a perfect way to start off my summer
   fair and festival obsession.  If you live in New England and you have a
   fair or festival you recommend leave me a comment. We are always up for
   a road trip!

Korean Paper Hat Craft

   [034.JPG]
   [026.JPG]
   Recently we went to a Korean Cultural Celebration at our local college.
   They had several craft stations set up...calligraphy, book marks, and
   this, paper hat making. This was the girls favorite activity. They had
   the hats folded and ready for the kids to decorate with dot paints and
   tissue flowers.
   [047.JPG]
   I dissected the hat to show you how simple it is to make one. Take one
   large piece of paper.
   [048.JPG]
   Fold top edge down about an inch.
   [049.JPG]
   Fold paper in half.
   [050.JPG]
   Fold bottom edge about 1/4 - 1/2 inch.
   [052.JPG]
   Tape along edge.
   [054.JPG]
   Tape strings for ties by the corners with the wide fold. The wide fold
   is the front of the hat.
   Let children decorate with paints, markers and tissue flowers.
   Have fun crafting with your kids!

Wet Felted Rocks

   We are totally felt crazy here at the 4 Crazy Kings.
   We have made felted soap, ornaments, beads, art pieces, fairy crowns,
   flower barrettes, and change purses. Quickly running out of things to
   felt we heard you could wet felt a rock. A rock? You might be asking
   yourself why? Well, with summer almost here we have been eating outside
   almost every night. We found a small felted rock makes the perfect
   napkin weight.  A larger rock makes an excellent doorstop.  We even
   made a few "hamster" rocks for the kids friends.  They have actually
   been a big hit. Who knows, maybe we could single handily bring back the
   pet rock!
   [blogrocks+001.JPG]
   They are pretty fun to make and Michael's craft store recently started
   selling wool roving. Although you will get a better selection of colors
   on line or if you are lucky enough to live near a store like New
   England Felting in Massachusetts.  Wool and sheep shows are also a
   great source.
   [blogrocks+002.JPG]
   The small rocks are easy for little kids to felt.  There are plenty of
   YouTube videos on how to wet felt.  With kids I would help them layout
   the felt and wrap around the rock. Several layers are necessary to get
   good coverage.  Place rock wrapped in felt into a knee high pantie
   hose. Tie off pantie hose and then have them start the felting process.
   [blogrocks+005.JPG]
   You can see the smaller rock needs to be felted better. Depending on
   the age and attention span of your child you may end up with some
   partially felted rocks.  No worries.  You can always have them go back
   and continue felting another time. Just add soap, warm water and
   continue rubbing.
   Have fun crafting with your kids!

We're Back!

   [035.JPG]
   Summer isn't summer without a few cuts, scrapes and skinned knees.
   I guess, we're ahead of the curve...
   We found signing the girls bandaids help make the boo boos feel better!
   Happy Memorial Day! We are back blogging for the summer.
