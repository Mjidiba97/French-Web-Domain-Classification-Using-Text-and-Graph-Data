The Pharo MOOC

   Welcome to the Pharo Mooc (a set of videos, exercises, challenges, and
   miniprojects). The Pharo Mooc is fully dubbed in french and english. It
   comes with subtitles in Japanese, english, french and spanish. This web
   site contains all the material of this Mooc in free access. In
   addition, in average every 18 months the Mooc is proposed and run on
   the France Université Numérique platform (Even if the platform is
   french the mooc is run in both languages). When you participate to the
   mooc you get access to the quizz and the credit validation.

Join the 2019 Mooc run

   Fourth run will start 6th of May 2019. Join, have fun and learn (check
   the testimonies below). This MOOC includes some presequel videos about
   Object-oriented Programming (OOP) for newbies French version and
   English version.

News

April 2019

   For its third run, the Pharo Mooc got more than 3200 participants with
   around 500 active learners from more than 100 countries with 181
   participants that obtained the attestation by answering quiz.

   We would like want to thanks our sponsors: Unit, Unisciel, and the
   LearningLab of Inria.

February 2018

   For its second run, the Pharo Mooc got more than 2500 participants with
   around 500 active learners from 92 countries with 176 participants that
   finished it.

   We would like want to thanks our sponsors: Unit, Unisciel, and the

 Hi! I finished the MOOC some weeks ago and I would like to congratulate everybo
dy involved! After a decade+ of Python programming I think I found my new favori
te language :). I'm making a small Teapot server for Slack command bots, I'm goo
na push it to Github (yay Iceberg), if anyone is interested.

Hey all - I've just finished the Mooc - thanks for an excellent course and a tho
uroughly interesting look at a new way to program :smile: Looking forward to sta
rting to play with Pharo on some upcoming ideas I've had.

I finished the Pharo MOOC a few days ago. Thank you very much to Damien, Stephan
e, and Luc for their work on the material! I enjoyed it very much

Hey, I've just finished the Mooc. It's awesome. I'm sending you the typos or min
or issues I've noticed throughout the mooc. Additionally, there must be a bug in
 the scoring algorithm, since I got >100% even though I failed some quizs.

About this course

   If you are either a beginner or an expert in object-oriented
   programming, this MOOC will change the way you program with objects:
   come and learn or rediscover object-oriented programming with Pharo!

   Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language in the tradition
   of Smalltalk. It offers a unique developing experience in constant
   interaction with live objects. Pharo is elegant, fun to use and very
   powerful. It is very easy to learn and enables to understand advanced
   concept in a natural way. When programming in Pharo, you are immersed
   in a world of live objects. You have immediate feedback at any moment
   of your development on objects representing web applications, code
   itself, graphics, network. More…

   Pharo is also a very powerful open-source environment used by companies
   to develop web applications.

   In this MOOC, we will present more specifically Pharo’s Web stack which
   changes the way you build web applications.

   In addition we will present fundamental programming concepts and how
   Pharo uses them. We will present some coding idioms and Design Patterns
   to better design object-oriented applications. Such concepts can be
   applied to any object-oriented programming language.

   This MOOC is intended for people with a programming experience but
   everyone motivated could follow the course thanks to the numerous
   resources proposed. This MOOC will also have an interest for computer
   programming teachers: Pharo is a good teaching tool for object-oriented
   programming and the course will discuss object-oriented design
   principles (e.g. polymorphism, message sending, self/super, design
   patterns).

   Throughout this MOOC you will :
     * learn how to program in Pharo,
     * be immersed in a live environment and live a new programming
       experience,
     * develop a web application to apply the different aspects of Pharo
       presented in the course.

   This MOOC will also provide a new vision of the fundamental principles
   of object-oriented programming, i.e. polymorphism and late binding.

   This course lasts 7 weeks.

   Each week is composed of several sequences containing a video lecture,
   quizzes and other videos proposing application exercises and
   programming demonstrations.

   This course is proposed in french and in english. Videos are in french
   with french and english subtitles. Pdf course documents (in english
   only) will be available. All other materials (quizzes, explanation
   texts…) will be offered in both languages.

Obtaining the MOOC

   We strongly suggest to follow the MOOC during the next session on
   France Université Numérique that will start May 6th, 2019 because you
   will be able to discuss with other learners.

   Join the discord channel mooc on the Pharo community (Invitation at
   http://discord.gg/QewZMZa)

   But, you can also access all resources of this MOOC offline on:
     * WebPortal: full online lecture with all videos and exercises,
     * CanalU: one of the key website that delivers resources for teaching
       and research.

How to follow this MOOC?

   We propose five profiles to follow this MOOC at different speed and
   levels. The Mooc sequences will be tagged according to these profiles.
   The profiles are not exclusive: to become a pharo expert you need to
   start as a newbie and grow up. Of course, you can also follow the full
   MOOC.
     * 🐥 Total newbies [Newbies] Focus on the beginning of the lectures,
       you can skip the Seaside/Mongo and tinyBlog exercises. Follow the
       end of the Mooc but without trying to understand everything. Take
       it easy and spend time understanding that the system is written in
       itself. Focus on the navigation tools (senders and implementors).
     * 🌐 Looking for Web [Web] For those that focus on web development, we
       suggest to get started with the syntax (since we really love this
       lecture you should really watch the not implementation and
       sequels), then look at Teapot and Seaside/Mongo combo. From the
       exercise stand point, focus on tinychat and tinyblog.
     * 🎁 Refresh your OO perspective [OO] If you want to rethink your OO
       perspective, pay attention that even Pharo essential libraries such
       as Booleans or collections are plain objects. Yes you send a
       message to a collection to perform a loop. Yes you send a message
       to a Boolean to perform a conditional.
     * 🌶 Wanna be a Pharo expert [Xpert] Well it means that you should
       have a look at everything. You may drop the Web and the Black Magic
       parts if you are in a hurry.
     * 🔮 Looking for Black Magic [Magic] If you are interesting by really
       advanced notions close to black magic ;-) It explains things such
       as reflection, meta-classes, meta-programming, etc. that makes
       Pharo a unique OO language. Of course, these lectures require
       almost everything except the Web part.

       Luc Fabresse received his PhD in computer science in 2007 from the
       University of Montpellier 2, France. He is currently an associate
       professor in the CAR research theme at Mines Douai, Mines-Telecom
       Institute. Luc is the co-author of several research papers
       advocating the use of dynamic and reflective languages such as
       Pharo to support live programming of mobile and autonomous robots
       in an efficient way. Luc's long-term vision is to be able to use
       Jedi mind trick on mobile robots ;-) Meanwhile, he concretizes all
       his ideas (models and tools) in the PhaROS platform (a Pharo client
       for the Robotics Operating System) to develop, debug, test, deploy,
       execute and benchmark robotics applications. Each year, Luc gives
       many computer science lectures and co-organizes events (technical
       days, conferences, ...). He also promotes Smalltalk (ESUG board
       member) and participates to its open-source implementation Pharo.
