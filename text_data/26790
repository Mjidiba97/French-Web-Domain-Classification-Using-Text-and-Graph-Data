Welcome to TinyURL!™

   Are you sick of posting URLs in emails only to have it break when sent
   causing the recipient to have to cut and paste it back together? Then
   you've come to the right place. By entering in a URL in the text field
   below, we will create a tiny URL that will not break in email postings
   and never expires.
   Enter a long URL to make tiny:

An example

   Turn this URL:
   http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Globally/dp/B003F
   SUDM4/ref=amb_link_353259562_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-10&

   2Y27P3M
   into this TinyURL:
   http://tinyurl.com/KindleWireless
   Which one would you rather cut and paste into your browser? That's the
   power of TinyURL!

Add TinyURL to your browser's toolbar

   TinyURL Toolbar.

   Click and drag the following link to your links toolbar.
   TinyURL!
   Once this is on your toolbar, you'll be able to make a TinyURL at the
   click of a button. By clicking on the toolbar button, a TinyURL will be
   created for the page you are currently at.

   This is compatible with most web browsers and platforms as long as your
   bookmarks or favorites allow javascript. The links toolbar may not be
   visible in all setups and in most browsers, you can enable it in the
   View->Toolbars menu of your web browser. You can also put it in your
   bookmarks instead of the links toolbar.

Redirection to any page in your site!

   With TinyURL, you can also make a smaller URL that will work for any
   page on your site. Let's say that you have a website with the homepage
   that is at:
   http://www.my-internet-isp.com/~myusername
   Entering that URL into TinyURL will create a URL like
   http://tinyurl.com/3
   With this you can then redirect someone to anywhere within your site by
   appending a slash and the pages filename to it. So if you have a page
   at http://www.my-internet-isp.com/~myusername/my-links-page.html, you
   can use the URL http://tinyurl.com/3/my-links-page.html and going to
   this URL will forward the visitor to the page in your website.

Link to us!

   Please link to us! Just make a link to https://tinyurl.com or use the
   following code to make a URL input box:
   <form action="https://tinyurl.com/create.php" meth
   <table align="center" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#E7
   <b>Enter a long URL to make <a href="https://tinyu
   <input type="text" name="url" size="30"><input typ
   </td></tr></table>________________________________
