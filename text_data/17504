   Picture of Pallets Playhouse

   This is my first big DIY project for our little girls. I'm a computer
   specialist but very interested in DIY and reusing old/unused items. I'm
   posting this instructable to inspire others to reuse materials and
   create something beautiful. English isn't my mother language so if I
   describe something the wrong way, feel free to ask me to explain.

   This project did cost me about € 150 since I did buy screws, roofing,
   paint and Plexiglas (acrylic glass, since it's safer for the kids). All
   other materials pallet planks and different sizes of beams thrown away
   by factories.

   Time, supplies and tools used are personal, since this can vary from
   person to person. I worked on this project before and after work with
   the materials i got from the factories and hobby tools.

   The playhouse is 260 cm x 260 cm (102.4 inch x 102.4 inch). I hope you
   enjoy this instructable.

Step 1: Drawing the Playhouse Plan

   Picture of Drawing the Playhouse Plan

   Every project needs a plan. I've used Google Sketchup to draw a plan of
   the playhouse with the right dimensions and printed it so I could build
   it step by step without having to measure it all while working on it.
   This step is optional because not everyone likes to put time into
   creating it on a computer.

Step 2: Pallet Break Apart

   Break apart all the pallets and remove any nails, screws, staples, ...
   No, the factory does not do this for you but for me it's worth it,
   seeing the result in the end.

   I've used a big flat screwdriver to break apart the pallets but you can
   use a crowbar aswell.
   The screws are removed with a powerd screwdriver, the nails with a
   hammer and the staples with a flat screwdriver.

Step 3: Creating the Base

   Picture of Creating the Base Picture of Creating the Base Picture of
   Creating the Base

   I've used planks of 260 cm (102.4 inch) to create a square base. In
   between I've used the same planks with about 4 cm (1.6 inch) cut off, 2
   cm (0.8 inch) on each side to fit between the outer ones. I've screwed
   it all together with 8 cm (3.1 inch) screws.

   The floor on the second image is where I started using the planks from
   the pallets. Yes, I had to make the whole floor in 2 parts since the
   planks of the pallets were 130 cm (51.2 inch) and I didn't have any
   longer planks for the floor :-)

   If you want to create this playhouse, you have to wait with the front
   floor. You'll see why in one of the next steps.

Step 4: Wall Frames

   Picture of Wall Frames Picture of Wall Frames

   Each frame (2 on the sides, 1 front, 1 back) should be created before
   placing it on the base.

   On the first image you can see how i create the wall frame. In the
   center is a 50 cm x 50 cm (19.7 inch x 19.7 inch) window opening. The
   dimensions of the wall frame are 130 cm x 130 cm (51.2 inch x 51.2
   inch). I've used the beams of the pallets where the planks where
   attached to.

   I created this frame 2 times with the same dimensions, as you can see
   on the second image. I've attached them to the base with 8 cm (3.1
   inch) screws, each frame containing 7 screws in the bottom.

Step 5: Front Frame

   Picture of Front Frame

   The front frame should be created with 2 whole planks at the top or it
   won't be stable enough. The left and right side are mirrored again.
   Each of the sides containing a window hole of 50 cm x 50 cm (19.7 inch
   x 19.7 inch). These holes are located higher than those of the wall
   frames. The door opening has a width of 60 cm (23.6 inch) and a height
   of 115 cm (45.3 inch). Again this frame is screwed to the base. The
   wall frames are screwed together with the front frame.

Step 6: Back Frame

   Picture of Back Frame

   Maybe it's hard to see on this image, but this is when I placed the
   back frame. Use beams over all the width so it's connecting with the
   wall frames. Put inner beams vertical to create enough support. Screw
   it to the base and wall frames.
   After doing this step all beams should be connected to eachother and
   the base.

Step 7: Side Planks

   Picture of Side Planks Picture of Side Planks

   Each wall side contains 13 planks attached from bottom to top. I've
   started at the bottom since I wasn't sure if every pallet plank really
   was 10 cm (3.9 inch) high. All the planks are screwed with 4 cm (1.6
   inch) screws to the beams. Obviously you need to cut the planks on the
   sides of the window holes. At the back panel I've used 2 columns of 13
   planks. It's the back so nobody will notice :)

   In total I've used 78 planks covering the frame, which is about 12
   pallets containing 7 planks.

Step 8: Building the Porch

   Picture of Building the Porch Picture of Building the Porch

   Maybe, you've been wondering why I hadn't created the front floor yet.
   As you can see on the images, I've placed 2 roof support beams inside
   the base frame and screwed it diagonally with several screws. After
   that i covered the front floor with 26 more pallet planks.
   For the porch thingies I used the support beams of the pallets again
   and screwed them to the corner beams of the front frame and the front
   beams of the roof support.

   For the roof I've used 8 beams, 2 placed horizontally on top of the
   wall frames.
   One angle containing 2 beams which are connected to eachother by
   placing 2 wooden triangles which you have to cut in the angle of your
   choice. You can connect 2 triangles on both sides of the beams with
   several screws to hold them into place. I did this 3 times (back,
   middle and front).

Step 9: Plywood

   Picture of Plywood

   As you can see on the image, the porch frame is done.

   On the roof I've screwed 2 big plywood rectangles which I got for free
   aswell from the factory throwing away all these reusable things. Since
   they didn't cover the whole roof I've screwed 4 pallet planks on each
   side of the roof to cover it all.

   Another thing you might notice on this image is the front panel is
   totally covered up with planks. You can place planks all the way up to
   the roof. Same thing on the back frame. Ofcourse you need to cut the
   planks in an angle to touch the roof panels.

Step 10: Sanding

   Picture of Sanding Picture of Sanding

   Sanding, sanding, sanding, ... What a hard work!

   As you can see on the first image (top of wall) I started sanding with
   a powered sanding tool with sanding paper size 40 since the planks were
   in bad condition.
   After covering the whole playhouse with the tool I covered it all again
   by hand using sanding paper size 120.

Step 11: Protecting the Wood

   Picture of Protecting the Wood

   After sanding I started painting the house with a product to protect
   the wood against all weather conditions, worms, ... I don't know how to
   call it in english.

   As you can see on the image I also started creating the windows and
   window frames.

Step 12: Playhouse Windows

   Picture of Playhouse Windows Picture of Playhouse Windows

   I don't have any detailed images of creating these small windows, but
   if anyone is interesed I will create another and create an instructable
   about it using pallet planks, plexiglas and inexpensive window locks.

   Every window in this playhouse (4 in total) can be opened from the
   inside and locked again by using small latches.

Step 13: Roof Shingles

   Picture of Roof Shingles

   As you can see on the image I've used dark grey roof shingles to cover
   the roof. I nailed them onto the roof panels.
   Since I never did this before I watched a tutorial on how to do this.
   (Tutorial)

   On the sides of the roof I screwed some waving pallet planks cut with a
   figure saw.

Step 14: Playhouse Door

   Picture of Playhouse Door Picture of Playhouse Door Picture of
   Playhouse Door

   Personally this was the most difficult thing to do for me, since I'm a
   beginner at all this DIY things.

   First of all I did create the door using Google Sketchup.
   The door is made of 3 "panels". The outer ones only contain the frame
   of the door using pallet planks cut to to right dimensions and the
   middle one is made by using pallet planks ...again :)
   The flower on the door is made by cutting out the middle circle and
   leaves using a figure saw and glued them onto the door.

   I mentioned this was the most difficult part of the whole house. Well,
   creating a whole big enough to put in a lock was the most difficult
   part and I got frustrated several times. As you can see on the second
   image I did cut out several parts of the planks of the door and had to
   cover it up with some wood paste.

   At the end it came up pretty good so I'm glad I didn't give up creating
   that door.

Step 15: End Result - Outside

   Picture of End Result - Outside Picture of End Result - Outside Picture
   of End Result - Outside

   After some green/white paint this is my end result on the outside. The
   last thing on the outside I need to do is paint the floor, but I don't
   know which color. Any suggestions?

   As you can see on the images I did also create some flower pots made of
   pallet planks and 2 benches where the girls can sit on.

   I might create instructables how to create those simple flower pots and
   multifunctional benches if someone is interested.

   I hope you enjoyed reading/viewing this instructable. The most
   important thing of this playhouse is to prove anyone can create
   something functional/pretty using old or discarded materials. I must
   say I'm proud of what i created for the kids since I'm a 'computer
   nerd' and never thought i was this kind of handy in any way.

   The youngest of them loves their little house already :)

   Thank you again for reading/viewing and hope to see you again another
   time!

   I'm sorry for the Really late post but I do think it's possible. The
   base will have to be a little bit bigger imo and the beams could be a
   bit wider for more support. Or maybe even extra beams placed diagonal
   inside the side panels for extra support.

   Alas! I have researched the web and found no information on this trap,
   fortunately, I still remember it when it was taught to me by a cousin
   28 years ago while I was on summer vacation in the countryside. What
   better place to document it than https://www.instructables.com! So here
   goes...
   Imagine being stranded on an island or trying to rebuild a community
   after a zombie apocalypse and you find some chickens! Hunting them
   would be simple for most, but you want to capture and domesticate them
   for the eggs! Here I present to you the knowledge on how to build a
   simple chicken trap, the ancient way!

Step 1: Gather the Materials

   Picture of Gather the Materials Picture of Gather the Materials Picture
   of Gather the Materials Picture of Gather the Materials

   You will need the following:
   1. A coconut or other bowl-shaped container (half a coconut if you are
   stranded on an island, an ordinary bowl or even a ramen noodle plastic
   bowl would do for urban setting)
   2. the spring mechanism, coconut frond midrib (pickup the dried fronds,
   not fresh as they are flexible, mostly used for weaving) or fashion
   some from bamboo or wooden skewers or twigs. plastic pickup sticks
   would also do! you can find and improvise on a lot of materials for
   this once you see the assembled trap.
   3. a string or light rope. for the island scenario, you can gather some
   from local flora or fashion a rope from the coconut husk strands as
   shown in the picture below. for urban setting, you can find a lot to
   use ranging from making some from your shirt, using shoelaces,
   paracord, etc. also shown is the dried coconut husk where you can get
   the fibers.

Step 2: Prepare the Main Body and Spring Mechanism

   Picture of Prepare the Main Body and Spring Mechanism Picture of
   Prepare the Main Body and Spring Mechanism Picture of Prepare the Main
   Body and Spring Mechanism Picture of Prepare the Main Body and Spring
   Mechanism

   Here are the materials I have gathered for my trap. Half a coconut,
   some dried frond midribs, and a red string.
   The next step would be to cut the spring mechanism so that it would
   form parabolas on your bowl as shown in the pictures.
   notes:
   You can use a coconut half with a husk, my sample here has its husk
   removed (I got it from a local wet market outside our place)
   Do not put the edges of the spring mechanism too deep inside the bowl.
   The sticks/ midribs would just bend downwards when touched by the
   chicken and will not flick/jump when touched by the chicken.
   Do be careful when working with this part! We don't want the midribs to
   jump up and poke your eyes!

Step 3: Set the Snare

   Picture of Set the Snare Picture of Set the Snare

   Next step would be to prepare your string or rope by creating a noose
   that would tighten on the chicken's neck. For the chicken's safety, add
   a stopping knot somewhere along the string so the noose will not full
   close and choke the chicken :D
   Put it on top of the spring mechanism as shown in the picture. The trap
   is done! Oh yeah, you would need bait, hopefully you have saved some of
   the coconut meat, shred it using a shell or rock and sprinkle some on
   the area near your trap. Not too close to it as the chicken's
   scratching motion might disturb the trap and prematurely trigger it.
   Put some inside the bowl as bait. For urban setting, use some rice or
   dried corn bits or even bread crumbs as bait. Secure the other end of
   the string using a stake driven to the ground or tie it up to a tree or
   sapling.
   Notes:
   Be careful with the spring mechanism! They might jump and poke your
   eyes!
   Add the stopping knot so the rope or string will not fully close on the
   chicken's neck. You are going to leave the trap, you want the chicken
   alive to domesticate it!
   Secure the other end. Do not underestimate the power of wild chickens!
   Once snared, they will run and even try to fly away! They can easily
   pull or even break the string/ rope you used.

Step 4: Working Mechanism

   Picture of Working Mechanism

   Now you know how to make the ancient chicken trap. It works by flicking
   the string over the chicken's neck once the chicken pecks on the bait
   you set inside the bowl. The trap works by relying on the chicken's
   pecking behavior, the upward movement of its head would bump on the
   fronds and cause them to spring out  and ensnare the neck. The sudden
   jerk would cause the chicken to panic and run, tightening the noose
   around its neck. It'll be ready for you to subdue and capture it for
   domestication.
   Some final notes on the chicken trap:
   Always be careful in making the trap, simple may it seem it could still
   misfire and hurt you.
   Making the string too small would cause the chicken to peck under the
   string/ rope.
   Using a deep bowl might not work as the chicken would not easily see
   the bait inside it.
   Chickens are...uhm, chickens! They'd flee in the first sign of danger.
   Wild chickens you may find on an island would surely be suspicious so
   give your trap some room to work.
   Secure your trap, dig a little to put your bowl in the ground to avoid
   it being bumped and tilted by the chicken. A half coconut with husk
   would sit properly if the bottom of the husk has been chopped off and
   is flat.

Step 5: Final Notes

   Picture of Final Notes

   So there you go! I am happy to have documented and shared this
   knowledge with you. Hope you'll have fun in making your own chicken
   traps! Don't forget to post some pictures and share some experiences
   doing it!
   Some more notes:
   I have seen this work on chickens. I do not know if it would also be
   effective on other birds. Please free to try it out and post your
   results!
   This trap is better than the drop trap -  the chicken may approach it
   from any direction and does not need someone to jerk the stick securing
   the drop trap
   Sometimes (like what happened to me on my first trap), the part of the
   spring mechanism closest to the chicken flung first, the string flung
   under the chicken's neck (the string should go over the head), the
   string did not snare the animal as intended. My second try did capture
   the chicken as I have adjusted the spring mechanism by not putting its
   edges too deep inside the coconut.

   I've not given up on this just yet, but my first attempt failed. I
   found the trap unsprung with all bait gone. My (monofilament) noose was
   nearby, not tightened, and may simply have blown off, though it wasn't
   windy overnight.
   Questions:
   1) Bait: it's totally possible that rats ate all the wild-bird-seed-mix
   bait I'd used. Were you using cooked, or uncooked rice? I'm thinking
   they might leave uncooked, or even cooked rice alone.
   2) 'springs' - I might just have to try the palm midribs, because I've
   not thought of any simple synthetic substitutes. I take it they need to
   be as springy as possible.
   3) The 'noose': you used a red fibery material, and I wanted to know if
   that might have been for the sake of texture/catching on the chicken's
   feathers, or maybe giving it enough weight/body so as to be flung up
   onto the chicken's neck - or if clear monofilament might be a better
   choice so it's not so obvious. Right now, I'm thinking it needs to be
   heavier than the monofilament I used.
   FYI: I'm in Honolulu, Hawaii. Feral roosters overran one of our outer
   islands some years back to the point where they're not likely ever to
   recover any peace, and the same thing occasionally seems to be
   happening here on Oahu. A couple of years back, the City tried to get
   contractors to bid on an $80K/year deal to trap & euthanize
   chickens...and had no takers. (I think we're too fat here...)

   if you want to find out how to make this trap. Look at any "Bird Dog"
   training books. They all describe how to make quail/pigeon traps. If
   not I can supply information about this trap. I have made 3 of them.

   When I was a little kid my cousin showed me the kind of trap you have
   in the first picture. We used orange crates and cans of catfood and
   trapped alley cats. The only problem we ran into was releasing the cats
   who were very unhappy.

   Picture of Pallets Playhouse

   This is my first big DIY project for our little girls. I'm a computer
   specialist but very interested in DIY and reusing old/unused items. I'm
   posting this instructable to inspire others to reuse materials and
   create something beautiful. English isn't my mother language so if I
   describe something the wrong way, feel free to ask me to explain.

   This project did cost me about € 150 since I did buy screws, roofing,
   paint and Plexiglas (acrylic glass, since it's safer for the kids). All
   other materials pallet planks and different sizes of beams thrown away
   by factories.

   Time, supplies and tools used are personal, since this can vary from
   person to person. I worked on this project before and after work with
   the materials i got from the factories and hobby tools.

   The playhouse is 260 cm x 260 cm (102.4 inch x 102.4 inch). I hope you
   enjoy this instructable.

Step 1: Drawing the Playhouse Plan

   Picture of Drawing the Playhouse Plan

   Every project needs a plan. I've used Google Sketchup to draw a plan of
   the playhouse with the right dimensions and printed it so I could build
   it step by step without having to measure it all while working on it.
   This step is optional because not everyone likes to put time into
   creating it on a computer.

Step 2: Pallet Break Apart

   Break apart all the pallets and remove any nails, screws, staples, ...
   No, the factory does not do this for you but for me it's worth it,
   seeing the result in the end.

   I've used a big flat screwdriver to break apart the pallets but you can
   use a crowbar aswell.
   The screws are removed with a powerd screwdriver, the nails with a
   hammer and the staples with a flat screwdriver.

Step 3: Creating the Base

   Picture of Creating the Base Picture of Creating the Base Picture of
   Creating the Base

   I've used planks of 260 cm (102.4 inch) to create a square base. In
   between I've used the same planks with about 4 cm (1.6 inch) cut off, 2
   cm (0.8 inch) on each side to fit between the outer ones. I've screwed
   it all together with 8 cm (3.1 inch) screws.

   The floor on the second image is where I started using the planks from
   the pallets. Yes, I had to make the whole floor in 2 parts since the
   planks of the pallets were 130 cm (51.2 inch) and I didn't have any
   longer planks for the floor :-)

   If you want to create this playhouse, you have to wait with the front
   floor. You'll see why in one of the next steps.

Step 4: Wall Frames

   Picture of Wall Frames Picture of Wall Frames

   Each frame (2 on the sides, 1 front, 1 back) should be created before
   placing it on the base.

   On the first image you can see how i create the wall frame. In the
   center is a 50 cm x 50 cm (19.7 inch x 19.7 inch) window opening. The
   dimensions of the wall frame are 130 cm x 130 cm (51.2 inch x 51.2
   inch). I've used the beams of the pallets where the planks where
   attached to.

   I created this frame 2 times with the same dimensions, as you can see
   on the second image. I've attached them to the base with 8 cm (3.1
   inch) screws, each frame containing 7 screws in the bottom.

Step 5: Front Frame

   Picture of Front Frame

   The front frame should be created with 2 whole planks at the top or it
   won't be stable enough. The left and right side are mirrored again.
   Each of the sides containing a window hole of 50 cm x 50 cm (19.7 inch
   x 19.7 inch). These holes are located higher than those of the wall
   frames. The door opening has a width of 60 cm (23.6 inch) and a height
   of 115 cm (45.3 inch). Again this frame is screwed to the base. The
   wall frames are screwed together with the front frame.

Step 6: Back Frame

   Picture of Back Frame

   Maybe it's hard to see on this image, but this is when I placed the
   back frame. Use beams over all the width so it's connecting with the
   wall frames. Put inner beams vertical to create enough support. Screw
   it to the base and wall frames.
   After doing this step all beams should be connected to eachother and
   the base.

Step 7: Side Planks

   Picture of Side Planks Picture of Side Planks

   Each wall side contains 13 planks attached from bottom to top. I've
   started at the bottom since I wasn't sure if every pallet plank really
   was 10 cm (3.9 inch) high. All the planks are screwed with 4 cm (1.6
   inch) screws to the beams. Obviously you need to cut the planks on the
   sides of the window holes. At the back panel I've used 2 columns of 13
   planks. It's the back so nobody will notice :)

   In total I've used 78 planks covering the frame, which is about 12
   pallets containing 7 planks.

Step 8: Building the Porch

   Picture of Building the Porch Picture of Building the Porch

   Maybe, you've been wondering why I hadn't created the front floor yet.
   As you can see on the images, I've placed 2 roof support beams inside
   the base frame and screwed it diagonally with several screws. After
   that i covered the front floor with 26 more pallet planks.
   For the porch thingies I used the support beams of the pallets again
   and screwed them to the corner beams of the front frame and the front
   beams of the roof support.

   For the roof I've used 8 beams, 2 placed horizontally on top of the
   wall frames.
   One angle containing 2 beams which are connected to eachother by
   placing 2 wooden triangles which you have to cut in the angle of your
   choice. You can connect 2 triangles on both sides of the beams with
   several screws to hold them into place. I did this 3 times (back,
   middle and front).

Step 9: Plywood

   Picture of Plywood

   As you can see on the image, the porch frame is done.

   On the roof I've screwed 2 big plywood rectangles which I got for free
   aswell from the factory throwing away all these reusable things. Since
   they didn't cover the whole roof I've screwed 4 pallet planks on each
   side of the roof to cover it all.

   Another thing you might notice on this image is the front panel is
   totally covered up with planks. You can place planks all the way up to
   the roof. Same thing on the back frame. Ofcourse you need to cut the
   planks in an angle to touch the roof panels.

Step 10: Sanding

   Picture of Sanding Picture of Sanding

   Sanding, sanding, sanding, ... What a hard work!

   As you can see on the first image (top of wall) I started sanding with
   a powered sanding tool with sanding paper size 40 since the planks were
   in bad condition.
   After covering the whole playhouse with the tool I covered it all again
   by hand using sanding paper size 120.

Step 11: Protecting the Wood

   Picture of Protecting the Wood

   After sanding I started painting the house with a product to protect
   the wood against all weather conditions, worms, ... I don't know how to
   call it in english.

   As you can see on the image I also started creating the windows and
   window frames.

Step 12: Playhouse Windows

   I don't have any detailed images of creating these small windows, but
   if anyone is interesed I will create another and create an instructable
   about it using pallet planks, plexiglas and inexpensive window locks.

   Every window in this playhouse (4 in total) can be opened from the
   inside and locked again by using small latches.

Step 13: Roof Shingles

   Picture of Roof Shingles

   As you can see on the image I've used dark grey roof shingles to cover
   the roof. I nailed them onto the roof panels.
   Since I never did this before I watched a tutorial on how to do this.
   (Tutorial)

   On the sides of the roof I screwed some waving pallet planks cut with a
   figure saw.

Step 14: Playhouse Door

   Picture of Playhouse Door Picture of Playhouse Door Picture of
   Playhouse Door

   Personally this was the most difficult thing to do for me, since I'm a
   beginner at all this DIY things.

   First of all I did create the door using Google Sketchup.
   The door is made of 3 "panels". The outer ones only contain the frame
   of the door using pallet planks cut to to right dimensions and the
   middle one is made by using pallet planks ...again :)
   The flower on the door is made by cutting out the middle circle and
   leaves using a figure saw and glued them onto the door.

   I mentioned this was the most difficult part of the whole house. Well,
   creating a whole big enough to put in a lock was the most difficult
   part and I got frustrated several times. As you can see on the second
   image I did cut out several parts of the planks of the door and had to
   cover it up with some wood paste.

   At the end it came up pretty good so I'm glad I didn't give up creating
   that door.

Step 15: End Result - Outside

   Picture of End Result - Outside Picture of End Result - Outside Picture
   of End Result - Outside

   After some green/white paint this is my end result on the outside. The
   last thing on the outside I need to do is paint the floor, but I don't
   know which color. Any suggestions?

   As you can see on the images I did also create some flower pots made of
   pallet planks and 2 benches where the girls can sit on.

   I might create instructables how to create those simple flower pots and
   multifunctional benches if someone is interested.

   I hope you enjoyed reading/viewing this instructable. The most
   important thing of this playhouse is to prove anyone can create
   something functional/pretty using old or discarded materials. I must
   say I'm proud of what i created for the kids since I'm a 'computer
   nerd' and never thought i was this kind of handy in any way.

   The youngest of them loves their little house already :)

   Thank you again for reading/viewing and hope to see you again another
   time!

   I'm sorry for the Really late post but I do think it's possible. The
   base will have to be a little bit bigger imo and the beams could be a
   bit wider for more support. Or maybe even extra beams placed diagonal
   inside the side panels for extra support.

   Im thinking of using this as a guideline to make a chicken coop! Its a
   very beautiful design and with a few modifications I think the chickens
   will look fabulous in it. hah

   Alas! I have researched the web and found no information on this trap,
   fortunately, I still remember it when it was taught to me by a cousin
   28 years ago while I was on summer vacation in the countryside. What
   better place to document it than https://www.instructables.com! So here
   goes...
   Imagine being stranded on an island or trying to rebuild a community
   after a zombie apocalypse and you find some chickens! Hunting them
   would be simple for most, but you want to capture and domesticate them
   for the eggs! Here I present to you the knowledge on how to build a
   simple chicken trap, the ancient way!

Step 1: Gather the Materials

   Picture of Gather the Materials Picture of Gather the Materials Picture
   of Gather the Materials Picture of Gather the Materials

   You will need the following:
   1. A coconut or other bowl-shaped container (half a coconut if you are
   stranded on an island, an ordinary bowl or even a ramen noodle plastic
   bowl would do for urban setting)
   2. the spring mechanism, coconut frond midrib (pickup the dried fronds,
   not fresh as they are flexible, mostly used for weaving) or fashion
   some from bamboo or wooden skewers or twigs. plastic pickup sticks
   would also do! you can find and improvise on a lot of materials for
   this once you see the assembled trap.
   3. a string or light rope. for the island scenario, you can gather some
   from local flora or fashion a rope from the coconut husk strands as
   shown in the picture below. for urban setting, you can find a lot to
   use ranging from making some from your shirt, using shoelaces,
   paracord, etc. also shown is the dried coconut husk where you can get
   the fibers.

Step 2: Prepare the Main Body and Spring Mechanism

   Picture of Prepare the Main Body and Spring Mechanism Picture of
   Prepare the Main Body and Spring Mechanism Picture of Prepare the Main
   Body and Spring Mechanism Picture of Prepare the Main Body and Spring
   Mechanism

   Here are the materials I have gathered for my trap. Half a coconut,
   some dried frond midribs, and a red string.
   The next step would be to cut the spring mechanism so that it would
   form parabolas on your bowl as shown in the pictures.
   notes:
   You can use a coconut half with a husk, my sample here has its husk
   removed (I got it from a local wet market outside our place)
   Do not put the edges of the spring mechanism too deep inside the bowl.
   The sticks/ midribs would just bend downwards when touched by the
   chicken and will not flick/jump when touched by the chicken.
   Do be careful when working with this part! We don't want the midribs to
   jump up and poke your eyes!

Step 3: Set the Snare

   Picture of Set the Snare Picture of Set the Snare

   Next step would be to prepare your string or rope by creating a noose
   that would tighten on the chicken's neck. For the chicken's safety, add
   a stopping knot somewhere along the string so the noose will not full
   close and choke the chicken :D
   Put it on top of the spring mechanism as shown in the picture. The trap
   is done! Oh yeah, you would need bait, hopefully you have saved some of
   the coconut meat, shred it using a shell or rock and sprinkle some on
   the area near your trap. Not too close to it as the chicken's
   scratching motion might disturb the trap and prematurely trigger it.
   Put some inside the bowl as bait. For urban setting, use some rice or
   dried corn bits or even bread crumbs as bait. Secure the other end of
   the string using a stake driven to the ground or tie it up to a tree or
   sapling.
   Notes:
   Be careful with the spring mechanism! They might jump and poke your
   eyes!
   Add the stopping knot so the rope or string will not fully close on the
   chicken's neck. You are going to leave the trap, you want the chicken
   alive to domesticate it!
   Secure the other end. Do not underestimate the power of wild chickens!
   Once snared, they will run and even try to fly away! They can easily
   pull or even break the string/ rope you used.

Step 4: Working Mechanism

   Picture of Working Mechanism

   Now you know how to make the ancient chicken trap. It works by flicking
   the string over the chicken's neck once the chicken pecks on the bait
   you set inside the bowl. The trap works by relying on the chicken's
   pecking behavior, the upward movement of its head would bump on the
   fronds and cause them to spring out  and ensnare the neck. The sudden
   jerk would cause the chicken to panic and run, tightening the noose
   around its neck. It'll be ready for you to subdue and capture it for
   domestication.
   Some final notes on the chicken trap:
   Always be careful in making the trap, simple may it seem it could still
   misfire and hurt you.
   Making the string too small would cause the chicken to peck under the
   string/ rope.
   Using a deep bowl might not work as the chicken would not easily see
   the bait inside it.
   Chickens are...uhm, chickens! They'd flee in the first sign of danger.
   Wild chickens you may find on an island would surely be suspicious so
   give your trap some room to work.
   Secure your trap, dig a little to put your bowl in the ground to avoid
   it being bumped and tilted by the chicken. A half coconut with husk
   would sit properly if the bottom of the husk has been chopped off and
   is flat.

Step 5: Final Notes

   Picture of Final Notes

   So there you go! I am happy to have documented and shared this
   knowledge with you. Hope you'll have fun in making your own chicken
   traps! Don't forget to post some pictures and share some experiences
   doing it!
   Some more notes:
   I have seen this work on chickens. I do not know if it would also be
   effective on other birds. Please free to try it out and post your
   results!
   This trap is better than the drop trap -  the chicken may approach it
   from any direction and does not need someone to jerk the stick securing
   the drop trap
   Sometimes (like what happened to me on my first trap), the part of the
   spring mechanism closest to the chicken flung first, the string flung
   under the chicken's neck (the string should go over the head), the
   string did not snare the animal as intended. My second try did capture
   the chicken as I have adjusted the spring mechanism by not putting its
   edges too deep inside the coconut.

   I've not given up on this just yet, but my first attempt failed. I
   found the trap unsprung with all bait gone. My (monofilament) noose was
   nearby, not tightened, and may simply have blown off, though it wasn't
   windy overnight.
   Questions:
   1) Bait: it's totally possible that rats ate all the wild-bird-seed-mix
   bait I'd used. Were you using cooked, or uncooked rice? I'm thinking
   they might leave uncooked, or even cooked rice alone.
   2) 'springs' - I might just have to try the palm midribs, because I've
   not thought of any simple synthetic substitutes. I take it they need to
   be as springy as possible.
   3) The 'noose': you used a red fibery material, and I wanted to know if
   that might have been for the sake of texture/catching on the chicken's
   feathers, or maybe giving it enough weight/body so as to be flung up
   onto the chicken's neck - or if clear monofilament might be a better
   choice so it's not so obvious. Right now, I'm thinking it needs to be
   heavier than the monofilament I used.
   FYI: I'm in Honolulu, Hawaii. Feral roosters overran one of our outer
   islands some years back to the point where they're not likely ever to
   recover any peace, and the same thing occasionally seems to be
   happening here on Oahu. A couple of years back, the City tried to get
   contractors to bid on an $80K/year deal to trap & euthanize
   chickens...and had no takers. (I think we're too fat here...)

   if you want to find out how to make this trap. Look at any "Bird Dog"
   training books. They all describe how to make quail/pigeon traps. If
   not I can supply information about this trap. I have made 3 of them.

   When I was a little kid my cousin showed me the kind of trap you have
   in the first picture. We used orange crates and cans of catfood and
   trapped alley cats. The only problem we ran into was releasing the cats
   who were very unhappy.
