   Completely in love with the product. It made my hair smell amazing and
   shine I had never seen it before. I was a little afraid to use it
   because my hair is oily, but I have no regrets, it was light and soft.

   I truly cannot rave about these diapers more. They are THE BEST. My
   daughter has not gotten a diaper rash since we’ve switched *knock on
   wood* and that was four month ago. They fit her booty so much better
   than the pampers we were using before (we’ve tried mostly pampers, and
   then some samples and free ones of Huggies, target brand, and honest
   brand). The prints are adorable and the quality is just fantastic. And
   the best part? They are SO FREAKING SOFT!

   I just happened upon this bottle warmer at Target and was a little
   concerned by reviews I had read online but opted to try it. It has been
   an amazing find and has made warming up bottles a breeze. The chart
   they provide is so helpful and the ease of putting the bottle or bag in
   is amazing. Overall amazing warmer.

   This products packaging is so pretty! Love the color of the bottle. The
   product was soft on my skin and cool when I applied it. However, when
   the product was in my face it burned in a few spots. Overall the
   product was just okay!

   This product is obsoletely amazing and transformative! Using this
   moisturizer i immediately felt my skin drink this all up. It is such a
   gentle and soft moisturizer and i just can’t get enough of it. When i’m
   running out i start to get nervous and this is such a good moisturizer
   definitely pricey but worth the buy if you can afford it.

   It didn’t taste like it was spiked at all. It just tasted like normal
   seltzer. I did like the berry flavor though.

   Gold Eyeshadow Palette

   This beauty deserves a million star's! I mean seriously, this palette
   lives up to its "Gold" name! I fell in love just looking at the
   color's&finally had to have her. Yes, she Comey's with a hefty pricetag
   but soooo worth it! Natasha has a creamy dreamy formula in these
   shadow's. The color story blender's like a dream, color after color.
   Look after look. This palette in particular was extremely complimentary
   to my green eyes. But I suggest this palette would make any eye color
   pop. Wow, pleaaase go spoil yourself, u won't regret this dimepiece!😉

   Worth the Hype Volumizing & Lengthening Mascara

   So I have watery eyes, it only effects my lower lashes so I used two
   different mascaras (one for lower-one for upper.... I know it’s extra).
   The waterproof version of this is AMAZING. My lower lashes look
   ridiculously long and they stay jet black all day, it never runs.

   Revlon has some great products and this is one of them. It says wears
   up to 16 hours that I don’t know because I never wear makeup for that
   length of time usually 8-9 hours at the most. I like the 204 charcoal
   color. It has a smudger and pull-out sharpener. I am satisfied with
   this product.
