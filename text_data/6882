                                  Overview

   Our Purpose

   We believe physical activity is fundamental to a healthy and happy
   life. Our ambition is to empower people to improve their lives through
   fitness.

   We are a technology company that meshes the physical and digital worlds
   to create a completely new, immersive, and connected fitness
   experience. We are also:

   a media company that creates engaging-to-the-point-of-addictive
   original programming with the best instructors in the world.

   an interactive software company that motivates our Members to achieve
   their goals.

   a product design company that develops beautiful and intuitive
   equipment that anticipates the needs of our Members.

   a social connection company that enables our community to support one
   another.

   a direct-to-consumer, multi-channel retail company that facilitates a
   seamless customer journey.

   an apparel company that allows Members to display their passion for
   Peloton.

   a logistics company that provides high-touch delivery, set up, and
   service for our Members.

   We are driven by our Members-first obsession and we will be any company
   we need to be in order to deliver the best fitness experience possible.

   Who We Are

   Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a
   loyal community of over 1.4 million Members. We pioneered connected,
   technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive,
   instructor-led boutique classes to our Members anytime, anywhere. We
   make fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient,
   while fostering social connections that encourage our Members to be the
   best versions of themselves. We define a Member as any individual who
   has a Peloton account.

   We are an innovation company at the nexus of fitness, technology, and
   media. We have disrupted the fitness industry by developing a
   first-of-its-kind subscription platform that seamlessly combines the
   best equipment, proprietary networked software, and world-class
   streaming digital fitness and wellness content, creating a product that
   our Members love. Our highly compelling offering helped our Members
   complete over 58 million Peloton workouts in fiscal 2019.

   Driven by our Members-first mindset, we built a vertically integrated
   platform that ensures a best-in-class, end-to-end experience. We have a
   direct-to-consumer multi-channel sales platform, including 74 showrooms
   with knowledgeable sales specialists, a high-touch delivery service,
   and helpful Member support teams. Our Members are as devoted to us as
   we are to them92% of our interactive fitness equipment ever sold,
   which we refer to as our Connected Fitness Products, still had an
   active Connected Fitness Subscription attached as of June 30, 2019.

Table of Contents

   Our Connected Fitness Product offerings currently include the Peloton
   Bike, launched in 2014, and the Peloton Tread, launched in 2018. Both
   our Bike and Tread include a state-of-the-art touchscreen that streams
   live and on-demand classes. Our products have a multitude of
   interactive software features that encourage frequent use, facilitate
   healthy competition on our patented leaderboard, build community among
   our Members, and inspire our Members to track performance and achieve
   their goals with real-time and historical metrics. As of June 30, 2019,
   we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products, with
   approximately 564,000 sold in the United States.

   Our world-class instructors teach classes across a variety of fitness
   and wellness disciplines, including indoor cycling, indoor/outdoor
   running and walking, bootcamp, yoga, strength training, stretching, and
   meditation. We produce over 950 original programs per month and
   maintain a vast and constantly updated library of thousands of original
   fitness and wellness programs. We make it easy for Members to find a
   class that fits their interests based on class type, instructor, music
   genre, length, available equipment, area of physical focus, and level
   of difficulty.

   Our content is available on our Connected Fitness Products through a
   $39.00 monthly Connected Fitness Subscription, which allows for
   unlimited workouts across multiple users within a household. Our
   Connected Fitness Subscribers can enjoy our classes anywhere through
   our digital app, Peloton Digital, which is available through iOS and
   Android mobile devices, as well as most tablets and computers. We also
   have Digital Subscribers who pay $19.49 per month for access to our
   content library on their own devices.

   Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our Connected
   Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue. We have
   experienced significant growth in sales of Connected Fitness Products,
   which, when combined with our strong Connected Fitness Subscriber
   retention rates, has driven high growth in Connected Fitness
   Subscribers. Our Connected Fitness Subscriber base grew by 108% in
   fiscal 2019.

   Our compelling financial profile is characterized by high growth,
   strong retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient
   customer acquisition. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness
   Churn, together with our high Subscription Contribution Margin,
   generates attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. When
   we acquire new Connected Fitness Subscribers, we are able to offset our
   customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our
   Connected Fitness Products. This allows for rapid payback of our sales
   and marketing investments and results in a robust unit economic model.

   We are a fast-growing and scaled fitness platform. For fiscal 2017,
   2018, and 2019:


     

   we generated total revenue of $218.6 million, $435.0 million, and
   $915.0 million, respectively, representing 99.0% and 110.3%
   year-over-year growth;


     

   we incurred net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and
   $(195.6) million, respectively; and


     

   our Adjusted EBITDA was $(51.8) million, $(30.4) million, and $(71.3)
   million, respectively.

   See the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and
   Other DataNon-GAAP Financial Measures for information regarding our
   use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted
   EBITDA.

   For fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, key metrics of our business included:


     

   Connected Fitness Subscribers of 107,708, 245,667, and 511,202,
   respectively; and


     

   Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn of 0.70%, 0.64%, and 0.65%,
   respectively.

   For a definition of Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, see
   the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
   Condition and Results of OperationsBusiness Model and for a
   definition of Connected Fitness Subscribers, Average Net Monthly
   Connected Fitness Churn, and Subscription Contribution Margin, see the

   $600 billion. According to the International Health, Racquet &
   Sportsclub Association, or IHRSA, 183 million and 62 million people had
   gym memberships globally and in the United States, respectively, as of
   2018.

   Our current product portfolio, which consists of our Bike, Tread, and
   fitness and wellness subscription services, addresses a large consumer
   base. Within our current and announced markets (the United States, the
   United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany), we estimate that 75 million
   people used treadmills and 27 million used stationary cycling bikes in
   the 12 months ended March 2019. In those same regions, we estimate that
   over 5 million treadmills and nearly 3 million stationary cycling bikes
   were purchased for in-home use in the 12 months ended March 2019.

   We believe that we are significantly expanding the market for fitness
   equipment and products. According to our 2019 Member Survey, four out
   of five Members were not in the market for home fitness equipment prior
   to purchasing a Peloton Connected Fitness Product.

   Opportunity

   We consider our market opportunity in terms of a Total Addressable
   Market, or TAM, which we believe is the market we can reach over the
   long-term in our current and announced markets, and a Serviceable
   Addressable Market, or SAM, which we address with our current product
   verticals and price points.

   According to our research, our TAM is 67 million households, of which
   45 million are in the United States. Within our TAM, we estimate that
   52 million households are interested in learning more about our
   Connected Fitness Products without seeing the price. We estimate that
   our SAM is 14 million Connected Fitness Products, with 12 million
   represented in the United States. Historically, our SAM has grown as
   our brand awareness has increased. With low brand awareness in our
   current international markets, we believe we will see SAM expand as we
   make further investments in building brand and product awareness in
   these regions. We will grow both TAM and SAM as we expand beyond our
   current geographies and grow SAM as we develop new Connected Fitness
   Products and content in new fitness verticals. With approximately
   577,000 Connected Fitness Products sold globally as of June 30, 2019,
   we are approximately 4% penetrated in our SAM of 14 million. For a
   discussion of the methodology used in determining our TAM and SAM, see
   the section titled Industry and Market Data.

   Consumer Trends in Our Favor

   Increasing Focus on Health and Wellness

   The growing awareness of the benefits of exercise and physical activity
   is driving increasing participation and spend in fitness and wellness.
   This has translated into consistent year-over-year growth of the
   fitness industry both in the United States and globally over the past
   two decades, even during times of economic recession. According to
   IHRSA, health club industry revenues in the United States grew at a
   5.4% annual growth rate over the last ten years. In addition, employers
   and health insurance companies are investing in employee well-being by
   offering incentives for preventative health measures such as exercise.
   According to a 2017 study by the National Business Group on Health, 74%
   of employers offer employee wellness incentives, with the average
   employee incentive amount increasing from $521 in 2013 to $742 in
   2017.^

   Streaming Media is the Leading Channel of Consumption

   The quality, volume, and speed of streaming content has profoundly
   changed media consumption patterns. Consumers can select from extensive
   catalogs of content across video programming, music, books, and gaming,
   among other categories, allowing for personalized, on-demand
   consumption anywhere, anytime, and at a great value. According to
   Kagan, a media research group of S&P Global Market Intelligence, global
   digital music paid subscribers are estimated to have grown from
   12.1 million in 2012 to 162.5 million in 2018. Similarly, digital video
   paid subscribers are estimated to have increased in the United States
   from 37.6 million in 2012 to 167.8 million in 2018.

   Desire for Community and Shared Experiences

   We believe consumers are increasingly spending on experiences and are
   seeking meaningful community connections. Within the fitness industry,
   consumers have migrated to boutique fitness due to personalization,
   expert instruction, and the sense of community. Boutique-style fitness
   offerings are the fastest growing brick-and-mortar fitness category.
   According to IHRSA, as of 2017, 40% of members of health and fitness
   clubs reported belonging to a boutique fitness studio, and from 2013 to
   2017, membership in boutique studios grew approximately 121%.

   Demand for Convenience

   Household trends, longer working hours, and the rise of mobile
   technology make it challenging to balance time between family, work,
   and personal health and wellness. According to the Pew Research Center,
   over the last few decades, there has been an increase in dual income
   families from 49% in 1970 to 66% in 2016. We believe that busy
   lifestyles, less free time, and changing household dynamics are driving
   demand for convenient fitness options.

   What Sets Us Apart

   Category-Defining Brand with Broad Appeal

   Peloton is the pioneer of connected, technology-enabled fitness. By
   meshing the physical and digital worlds, we have created an immersive
   experience that our Members love. We have scaled rapidly through
   data-driven marketing and education-based



                                      4

   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   sales efforts. Our marketing is made more efficient by the significant
   word-of-mouth referrals from our loyal Members, which has become one of
   our largest sales channels. As a result of strong Connected Fitness
   Product sales and low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, we
   have grown our Connected Fitness Subscribers from 35,135 as of June 30,
   2016 to 511,202 as of June 30, 2019, representing annualized growth of
   approximately 144.1%.

   We are democratizing access to high-quality boutique fitness by making
   it accessible and affordable through the compelling value of our
   unlimited household Connected Fitness Subscriptions and attractive
   financing programs for the Bike and Tread. We continue to broaden our
   demographic appealour fastest growing demographic segments are
   consumers under 35 years old and those with household incomes under
   $75,000.

   Growing and Scaled Platform with Network Effects

   As the largest interactive fitness platform in the world, our rapidly
   growing and scaled Member base is a highly strategic asset. With our
   first mover advantage, we have achieved critical mass, which improves
   our platform and Member experience. As of June 30, 2019, on average,
   nearly 6,400 Members participated in each cycling class, across live
   and on-demand. As our community of Members continues to grow, the
   Peloton fitness experience becomes more inspiring, more competitive,
   more immersive, and more connected. Over time, Members are embedded in
   the Peloton community and we become a part of their lives, increasing
   the opportunity cost of Members leaving or potential Members not
   joining our platform.

   Engaging-to-the-Point-of-Addictive Fitness Experience Drives High
   Retention

   By making fitness fun and motivating, we help our Members achieve their
   personal goals. We analyze millions of workouts per month to help us
   develop features that improve our Member experience and create new,
   on-trend fitness and wellness content that our Members crave.
   Engagement is the leading indicator of retention for our Connected
   Fitness Subscribers. We have consistently seen workouts increase over
   time. On average, our Connected Fitness Subscribers completed 7.5, 8.4,
   and 11.5 workouts per month in fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019,
   respectively. Usage drives value and loyalty, which is evidenced by our
   exceptional weighted-average 12-month Connected Fitness Subscriber
   retention rate of 95% across all fiscal year cohorts since fiscal 2016.

   Vertically Integrated Platform That is Difficult to Replicate

   We are driven by our Members-first obsession and see every Member
   touchpoint as an opportunity to exceed expectations. To create the best
   platform, we designed our own products, developed our own interactive
   software, and created our own high production value fitness and
   wellness programming. For full end-to-end Member support, we were also
   compelled to develop our own customer education, purchase and delivery,
   and services platform. We sell our Connected Fitness Products
   exclusively through our knowledgeable inside sales and showroom
   associates as well as our e-commerce site. Our high-touch delivery
   teams ensure that new Members are immediately set up and ready to work
   out on their new Bike or Tread. The effectiveness of our end-to-end
   platform is demonstrated by the high Net Promoter Score for our Bike,
   which has been within the range of 80 to 93 since we began measuring it
   in 2016.

   Compelling Financial Model

   Our financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong
   retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer
   acquisition. Our growth is attributable to our data-driven marketing
   approach and Member word-of-mouth referrals, both of which help us
   generate predictable and increasingly efficient Connected Fitness
   Product sales. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn,
   combined with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, results in
   attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. We offset
   customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our
   Connected Fitness Products, generating rapid payback of sales and
   marketing investments and robust unit economics.

   Founder-Led, Passionate Team

   Peloton was founded by John Foley in 2012. Along with his four
   co-founders, John set out to create the most convenient and immersive
   indoor cycling experience in the world. Our founders believed deeply
   that creating a Members-first experience would require Peloton to be as
   vertically integrated as possible, and so we built teams that span
   software development, product design, fitness instruction, content
   production, marketing, music, logistics, retail, and apparel. We
   believe that no other company is at the intersection of all these
   disciplines, which means that every day we are doing something that no
   other company has done before. This, along with the positive impact we
   have on our Members physical and mental well-being, fuels our passion
   for continuous innovation and progress.

   Growth Strategies

   Our goal is to rapidly grow our Member base through the sale of our
   Connected Fitness Products while continuing to engage and retain our
   scaled and loyal community of Members.

   Grow Brand Awareness

   We are still in the early stages of growth in our existing markets. As
   of June 30, 2019, we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness
   Products globally, a small fraction of the 14 million products we
   believe reflect our SAM. While our aided brand awareness has grown
   rapidly in the United States and reached 67% as of April 3, 2019, we
   have significant room to increase our brand and product awareness in
   both the United States and in our other geographies through television,
   digital, and social media marketing, as well as our showrooms and
   word-of-mouth referrals. We continue to broaden our demographic appeal
   by educating customers on the compelling value of our Connected Fitness
   Subscriptions.

   Continuously Improve Member Experience

   We constantly improve and evolve our interactive software and content
   to drive Member engagement, which helps us maintain our high retention
   rates as we grow. We deploy new software features frequently and
   currently produce over 950 original programs per month to keep our
   content library fresh and on-trend. We also continue to drive usage
   through innovative fitness and wellness programs and goal-based
   challenges that make Members feel more accountable and help them reach
   their personal goals. Total Workouts for our Connected Fitness
   Subscribers grew from 17.9 million in fiscal 2018 to 52.2 million in
   fiscal 2019, representing a 192% increase. For a definition of Total
   Workouts, see the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis
   of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsKey Operational and
   Business Metrics.

   Launch New Products and Expand Content Offering

   Over time, we plan to invest heavily in new product development and
   content to further penetrate our SAM. We will launch new Connected
   Fitness Products and accessories in our existing, as well as new
   fitness verticals, while continuously updating and expanding our
   original fitness and wellness programming. We will pursue new products
   where there is a large market opportunity in areas of fitness with
   staying power.

   Pursue Disciplined Expansion into New Geographies

   With more than 174 million people belonging to gyms globally, we
   believe there is significant opportunity for Peloton to grow
   internationally. In 2018, we began our international expansion and
   brought the Peloton experience to the United Kingdom and Canada. With
   our expansion into Germany in the winter of 2019, we will be in the
   largest fitness markets in the world. We will continue to pursue
   disciplined international expansion by targeting countries with high
   fitness penetration and spend, the presence of boutique fitness, and
   where we believe the Peloton value proposition will resonate.

   Invest in Our Platform

   We will continue to invest in technology and infrastructure to extend
   our leadership in connected fitness, increase our value proposition,
   and support our growth. Over the next couple of years, we will continue
   to invest in state-of-the-art production studios in New York City and
   London and a new headquarters in New York City, which will include a
   dedicated research and development facility for new product design,
   development, and testing. We will continue to invest heavily in a
   variety of software and hardware engineering functions, supply chain
   operations, manufacturing, and advanced quality assurance to support
   our growth.

   Increase Profitability Through Fixed Cost Leverage

   The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base will
   allow us to improve Subscription Contribution Margin, increase
   Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, and generate operating
   leverage. A significant portion of our content creation costs can be
   leveraged over time given that a limited number of production studios
   and instructors can support the future growth of our Subscriber base,
   which includes both our Connected Fitness and Digital Subscribers. We
   expect to drive continued efficiencies in sales and marketing expenses
   as we benefit from increasing brand awareness, word-of-mouth referrals
   from our growing Subscriber base, and further optimization of our sales
   and marketing investments by channel. We will also achieve operating
   leverage as we scale fixed general and administrative expenses,
   including those associated with our new headquarters in New York City.

                     Risks Associated with Our Business

   Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including
   those highlighted in the section titled Risk Factors immediately
   following this Prospectus Summary. Some of these risks include:


     

   We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur
   operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain
   profitability in the future;


     

   We may be unable to attract and retain Subscribers, which could have an
   adverse effect on our business and rate of growth;


     

   If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully
   develop and introduce new, innovative, and updated products and
   services in a timely manner or effectively manage the introduction of
   new or enhanced products and services, our business may be adversely
   affected;


     

   The market for our products and services is still in the early stages
   of growth and if it does not continue to grow, grows more slowly than
   we expect, or fails to grow as large as we expect, our business,
   financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected;


     

   We have a limited operating history, our past financial results may not
   be indicative of our future performance, and our revenue growth rate is
   likely to slow as our business matures;


     

   We operate in a highly competitive market and we may be unable to
   compete successfully against existing and future competitors;


     

   We derive a significant majority of our revenue from sales of our Bike
   and a decline in sales of our Bike would negatively affect our future
   revenue and operating results;


     

   We rely on a limited number of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics
   partners for our Connected Fitness Products and a loss of any of these
   partners could negatively affect our business;


     

   We have limited control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and
   logistics partners, which may subject us to significant risks,
   including the potential inability to produce or obtain quality products
   & services on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity;


     

   We depend upon third-party licenses for the use of music in our content
   and an adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold
   necessary licenses may have an adverse effect on our business,
   operating results, and financial condition;


     

   Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation
   of the Peloton brand; and


     

   The dual class structure of our common stock will have the effect of
   concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our
   capital stock prior to the completion of this offering, including our
   directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders.

                   Channels for Disclosure of Information

   We were formed in 2012 as Peloton Interactive, LLC, a Delaware limited

   on any such information in deciding whether to purchase our Class A
   common stock. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms Peloton, Peloton
   Interactive, we, us, and our refer to Peloton Interactive, Inc.,
   together with our consolidated subsidiaries.

   Peloton, the Peloton logo, Peloton Bike, Peloton Tread, Peloton

   service marks of Peloton appearing in this prospectus are the property
   of Peloton. This prospectus contains additional trade names,

   other companies trade names, trademarks, or service marks to imply a
   relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, these other
   companies. Solely for convenience, our trademarks and tradenames
   referred to in this prospectus appear without the ^® and ^ symbols,

              Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company

   As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our most
   recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth
   company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
   amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our
   Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth
   company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and
   other requirements that are otherwise applicable, in general, to public
   companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions
   include:


     

   not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
   of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;


     

   reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and


     

   exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote
   on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden
   parachute payments not previously approved.

   Emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised
   accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to
   private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves
   of this accommodation allowing for delayed adoption of new or revised
   accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new
   or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not
   emerging growth companies.

   We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur
   of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than
   $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (2) the date we qualify as a large
   accelerated filer, with at least $700 million of equity securities
   held by non-affiliates; (3) the date on which we have issued, in any
   three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt
   securities; and (4) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the
   fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering.

   We may take advantage of these exemptions until such time that we are
   no longer an emerging growth company. Accordingly, the information
   contained herein may be different than the information you receive from
   other public companies in which you hold stock.

   The pro forma as adjusted column reflects the items described in

   cover page of this prospectus, after deducting the estimated
   underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. The pro forma as
   adjusted information discussed above is illustrative only and will be
   adjusted based on the actual public offering price and other terms of
   this offering determined at pricing. Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in
   the assumed initial public offering price of $             per share,
   which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of
   this prospectus, would increase (decrease) cash and cash equivalents,
   working capital, total assets, and total stockholders (deficit) equity
   by $             million, assuming that the number of shares offered,
   as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same,
   and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount. Similarly,
   each increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares in the number of shares
   offered by us would increase (decrease) cash and cash equivalents,
   working capital, total assets, and total stockholders (deficit) equity
   by approximately $             million, assuming the assumed initial
   public offering price, which is the midpoint of the price range set
   forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after
   deducting the estimated underwriting discount.

                                RISK FACTORS

   Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk.
   You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described
   below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus,
   including the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of
   Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated
   financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in
   this prospectus before deciding whether to invest in shares of our
   Class A common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are
   not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we
   are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important
   factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following
   risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and
   future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that
   event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and
   you could lose part or all of your investment.

   Risks Related to Our Business

   We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur
   operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain
   profitability in the future.

   We have incurred operating losses each year since our inception in
   2012, including net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and
   $(195.6) million for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, and
   expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As a
   result, we had a total stockholders deficit of $(538.6) million at
   June 30, 2019. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the
   future as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to
   invest in research and development, expand our operating and retail
   infrastructure, add content and software features to our platform,
   expand into new geographies, and develop new Connected Fitness
   Products. Further, as a public company, we will incur additional legal,
   accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private
   company. These efforts and additional expenses may be more costly than
   we expect, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our
   revenue to offset our operating expenses. Our revenue growth may slow
   or our revenue may decline for a number of other reasons, including
   reduced demand for our products and services, increased competition, a
   decrease in the growth or reduction in size of our overall market, or
   if we cannot capitalize on growth opportunities. If our revenue does
   not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we will not be
   able to achieve and maintain profitability.

   We may be unable to attract and retain Subscribers, which could have an
   adverse effect on our business and rate of growth.

   We have experienced significant Subscriber growth over the past several
   years. Our continued business and revenue growth is dependent on our
   ability to continuously attract and retain Subscribers, and we cannot
   be sure that we will be successful in these efforts, or that Subscriber
   retention levels will not materially decline. There are a number of
   factors that could lead to a decline in Subscriber levels or that could
   prevent us from increasing our Subscriber levels, including:


     

   our failure to introduce new features, products, or services that
   Members find engaging or our introduction of new products or services,
   or changes to existing products and services that are not favorably
   received;


     

   harm to our brand and reputation;


     

   pricing and perceived value of our offerings;


     

   our inability to deliver quality products, content, and services;


     

   our Members engaging with competitive products and services;


     

   technical or other problems preventing Members from accessing our
   content and services in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise
   affecting the Member experience;


     

   unsatisfactory experiences with the delivery, installation, or service
   of our Connected Fitness Products;


     

   a decline in the publics interest in indoor cycling or running, or
   other fitness disciplines that we invest most heavily in; and


     

   deteriorating general economic conditions or a change in consumer
   spending preferences or buying trends.

   Additionally, further expansion into international markets such as
   Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany will create new challenges in
   attracting and retaining Subscribers that we may not successfully
   address. As a result of these factors, we cannot be sure that our
   Subscriber levels will be adequate to maintain or permit the expansion
   of our operations. A decline in Subscriber levels could have an adverse
   effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Table of Contents

   If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully
   develop and introduce new, innovative, and updated products and
   services in a timely manner or effectively manage the introduction of
   new or enhanced products and services, our business may be adversely
   affected.

   Our success in maintaining and increasing our Subscriber base depends
   on our ability to identify and originate trends as well as to
   anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner.
   Our products and services are subject to changing consumer preferences
   that cannot be predicted with certainty. If we are unable to introduce
   new or enhanced offerings in a timely manner, or our new or enhanced
   offerings are not accepted by our Subscribers, our competitors may
   introduce similar offerings faster than us, which could negatively
   affect our rate of growth. Moreover, our new offerings may not receive
   consumer acceptance as preferences could shift rapidly to different
   types of fitness and wellness offerings or away from these types of
   offerings altogether, and our future success depends in part on our
   ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to
   anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer
   preferences could lead to, among other things, lower subscription
   rates, lower sales, pricing pressure, lower gross margins, discounting
   of our existing Connected Fitness Products, and excess inventory
   levels. Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences,
   our ability to adequately react to and address them will partially
   depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative,
   high-quality offerings. Development of new or enhanced products and
   services may require significant time and financial investment, which
   could result in increased costs and a reduction in our profit margins.
   For example, we have historically incurred higher levels of sales and
   marketing expenses accompanying each product and service introduction.

   Moreover, we must successfully manage introductions of new or enhanced
   products and services, which could adversely impact the sales of our
   existing products and services. For instance, consumers may decide to
   purchase new or enhanced products and services instead of our existing
   products and services, which could lead to excess product inventory and
   discounting of our existing products and services.

   The market for our products and services is still in the early stages
   of growth and if it does not continue to grow, grows more slowly than
   we expect, or fails to grow as large as we expect, our business,
   financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.

   The connected fitness and wellness market is relatively new, rapidly
   growing, largely unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will sustain
   high levels of demand and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success
   depends substantially on the willingness of consumers to widely adopt
   our products and services. To be successful, we will have to educate
   consumers about our products and services through significant
   investment, and provide quality content that is superior to the content
   and experiences provided by our competitors. Additionally, the fitness
   and wellness market at large is heavily saturated, and the demand for
   and market acceptance of new products and services in the market is
   uncertain. It is difficult to predict the future growth rates, if any,
   and size of our market. We cannot assure you that our market will
   develop, that the publics interest in connected fitness and wellness
   will continue, or that our products and services will be widely
   adopted. If our market does not develop, develops more slowly than
   expected, or becomes saturated with competitors, or if our products and
   services do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial
   condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.

   We have a limited operating history and our past financial results may
   not be indicative of our future performance. Further, our revenue
   growth rate is likely to slow as our business matures.

   We began operations in 2012, shipped our first Bike in 2014, and
   shipped our first Tread in 2018. We have a limited history of
   generating revenue. As a result of our short operating history, we have
   limited financial data that can be used to evaluate our current
   business. Therefore, our historical revenue growth should not be
   considered indicative of our future performance. In particular, we have
   experienced periods of high revenue growth since we began selling our
   Bike that we do not expect to continue as our business matures.
   Estimates of future revenue growth are subject to many risks and
   uncertainties and our future revenue may differ materially from our
   projections. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks
   and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly
   changing industries, including market acceptance of our products and
   services, attracting and retaining Subscribers, and increasing
   competition and expenses as we expand our business. We cannot be sure
   that we will be successful in addressing these and other challenges we
   may face in the future, and our business may be adversely affected if
   we do not manage these risks

   successfully. In addition, we may not achieve sufficient revenue to
   attain or maintain positive cash flows from operations or profitability
   in any given period, or at all.

   We operate in a highly competitive market and we may be unable to
   compete successfully against existing and future competitors.

   Our products and services are offered in a highly competitive market.
   We face significant competition in every aspect of our business,
   including at-home fitness equipment and content, fitness clubs,
   in-studio fitness classes, and health and wellness apps. Moreover, we
   expect the competition in our market to intensify in the future as new
   and existing competitors introduce new or enhanced products and
   services that compete with ours.

   Our competitors may develop, or have already developed, products,
   features, content, services, or technologies that are similar to ours
   or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more successful
   product development efforts, create more compelling employment
   opportunities, or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive
   pricing policies. Our competitors may develop or acquire, or have
   already developed or acquired, intellectual property rights that
   significantly limit or prevent our ability to compete effectively in
   the public marketplace. In addition, our competitors may have
   significantly greater resources than us, allowing them to identify and
   capitalize more efficiently upon opportunities in new markets and
   consumer preferences and trends, quickly transition and adapt their
   products and services, devote greater resources to marketing and
   advertising, or be better positioned to withstand substantial price
   competition. If we are not able to compete effectively against our
   competitors, they may acquire and engage customers or generate revenue
   at the expense of our efforts, which could have an adverse effect on
   our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   We derive a significant majority of our revenue from sales of our Bike.
   A decline in sales of our Bike would negatively affect our future
   revenue and operating results.

   Our Connected Fitness Products are sold in highly competitive markets
   with limited barriers to entry. Introduction by competitors of
   comparable products at lower price points, a maturing product
   lifecycle, a decline in consumer spending, or other factors could
   result in a decline in our revenue derived from our Connected Fitness
   Products, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial
   condition, and operating results. Because we derive a significant
   majority of our revenue from the sales of our Bike, any material
   decline in sales of our Bike would have a pronounced impact on our
   future revenue and operating results.

   We rely on a limited number of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics
   partners for our Connected Fitness Products. A loss of any of these
   partners could negatively affect our business.

   We rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture and transport
   our Connected Fitness Products, including in some cases only a single
   supplier for some of our products and components. Our reliance on a
   limited number of manufacturers for each of our Connected Fitness
   Products increases our risks, since we do not currently have
   alternative or replacement manufacturers beyond these key parties. In
   the event of interruption from any of our manufacturers, we may not be
   able to increase capacity from other sources or develop alternate or
   secondary sources without incurring material additional costs and
   substantial delays. Furthermore, all of these manufacturers primary
   facilities are located in Taiwan. Thus, our business could be adversely
   affected if one or more of our suppliers is impacted by a natural
   disaster or other interruption at a particular location.

   If we experience a significant increase in demand for our Connected
   Fitness Products, or if we need to replace an existing supplier or
   partner, we may be unable to supplement or replace them on terms that
   are acceptable to us, which may undermine our ability to deliver our
   products to Members in a timely manner. For example, it may take a
   significant amount of time to identify a manufacturer that has the
   capability and resources to build our products to our specifications in
   sufficient volume. Identifying suitable suppliers, manufacturers, and
   logistics partners is an extensive process that requires us to become
   satisfied with their quality control, technical capabilities,
   responsiveness and service, financial stability, regulatory compliance,
   and labor and other ethical practices. Accordingly, a loss of any of
   our significant suppliers, manufactures, or logistics partners could
   have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
   operating results.

   We have limited control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and
   logistics partners, which may subject us to significant risks,
   including the potential inability to produce or obtain quality products
   and services on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.

   We have limited control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and
   logistics partners, which subjects us to risks, such as the following:


     

   inability to satisfy demand for our Connected Fitness Products;


     

   reduced control over delivery timing and product reliability;


     

   reduced ability to monitor the manufacturing process and components
   used in our Connected Fitness Products;


     

   limited ability to develop comprehensive manufacturing specifications
   that take into account any materials shortages or substitutions;


     

   variance in the manufacturing capability of our third-party
   manufacturers;


     

   price increases;


     

   failure of a significant supplier, manufacturer, or logistics partner
   to perform its obligations to us for technical, market, or other
   reasons;


     

   variance in the quality of last mile services provided by our
   third-party logistics partners;


     

   difficulties in establishing additional supplier, manufacturer, or
   logistics partner relationships if we experience difficulties with our
   existing suppliers, manufacturers, or logistics partners;


     

   shortages of materials or components;


     

   misappropriation of our intellectual property;


     

   exposure to natural catastrophes, political unrest, terrorism, labor
   disputes, and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade
   from foreign countries in which our Connected Fitness Products are
   manufactured or the components thereof are sourced;


     

   changes in local economic conditions in the jurisdictions where our
   suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners are located;


     

   the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to
   labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties,
   tariffs, taxes, and other charges on imports, as well as trade
   restrictions and restrictions on currency exchange or the transfer of
   funds; and


     

   insufficient warranties and indemnities on components supplied to our
   manufacturers or performance by our partners.

   We also rely on our logistics partners, including last mile warehouse
   and delivery partners, to complete a substantial percentage of our
   deliveries to customers, with the rest of the deliveries handled by our
   own last mile team. Our primary last mile partner relies on a network
   of independent contractors to perform last mile services for us in many
   markets. If any of these independent contractors, or the last mile
   partner as a whole, do not perform their obligations or meet the
   expectations of us or our Members, our reputation and business could
   suffer.

   The occurrence of any of these risks, especially during seasons of peak
   demand, could cause us to experience a significant disruption in our
   ability to produce and deliver our products to our customers.

   We depend upon third-party licenses for the use of music in our
   content. An adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold
   necessary licenses may have an adverse effect on our business,
   operating results, and financial condition.

   Music is an important element of the overall content that we make
   available to our Members. To secure the rights to use music in our
   content, we enter into agreements to obtain licenses from rights
   holders such as record labels, music publishers, performing rights
   organizations, collecting societies, artists, and other copyright
   owners or their agents. We pay royalties to such parties or their
   agents around the world.

   The process of obtaining licenses involves identifying and negotiating
   with many rights holders, some of whom are unknown or difficult to
   identify, and implicates a myriad of complex and evolving legal issues
   across many jurisdictions, including open questions of law as to when
   and whether particular licenses are needed. Rights holders also may
   attempt to


                                     18
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   take advantage of their market power to seek onerous financial terms
   from us. Our relationship with certain rights holders may deteriorate.
   Artists and/or artist groups may object and may exert public or private
   pressure on rights holders to discontinue or to modify license terms.
   Additionally, there is a risk that aspiring rights holders, their
   agents, or legislative or regulatory bodies will create or attempt to
   create new rights that could require us to enter into new license
   agreements with, and pay royalties to, newly defined groups of rights
   holders, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify.

   With respect to musical compositions, in addition to obtaining
   publishing rights, we generally need to obtain separate public
   performance rights. In the United States, public performance rights are
   typically obtained through intermediaries known as performing rights
   organizations, or PROs, which (a) issue blanket licenses with copyright
   users for the public performance of compositions in their repertory,
   (b) collect royalties under those licenses, and (c) distribute such
   royalties to copyright owners. We have agreements with each of the
   following PROs in the United States: the American Society of Composers,
   Authors and Publishers, or ASCAP, and Broadcast Music, Inc., or BMI,
   Global Music Rights, and SESAC. The royalty rates available to us from
   the PROs today may not be available to us in the future. Licenses
   provided by ASCAP and BMI currently are governed by consent decrees,
   which were issued by the U.S. Department of Justice in an effort to
   curb anti-competitive conduct. Removal of or changes to the terms or
   interpretation of these agreements could affect our ability to obtain
   licenses from these PROs on current and/or otherwise favorable terms,
   which could harm our business, operating results, and financial
   condition.

   In other parts of the world, including in Canada and Europe, we obtain
   licenses for musical compositions either through local collecting
   societies representing publishers, or from publishers directly, or a
   combination thereof. We cannot guarantee that our licenses with
   collecting societies and our direct licenses with publishers provide
   full coverage for all of the musical compositions we use in our service
   in the countries in which we operate, or that we may enter in the
   future. Publishers, songwriters, and other rights holders who choose
   not to be represented by major or independent publishing companies or
   collecting societies have, and could in the future, adversely impact
   our ability to secure licensing arrangements in connection with musical
   compositions that such rights holders own or control, and could
   increase the risk of liability for copyright infringement.

   Although we expend significant resources to seek to comply with the
   statutory, regulatory, and judicial frameworks, we cannot guarantee
   that we currently hold, or will always hold, every necessary right to
   use all of the music that is used on our service, and we cannot assure
   you that we are not infringing or violating any third-party
   intellectual property rights, or that we will not do so in the future.

   These challenges, and others concerning the licensing of music on our
   platform, may subject us to significant liability for copyright
   infringement, breach of contract, or other claims. For additional
   information, see the section titled BusinessLegal Proceedings.

   Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation
   of the Peloton brand.

   We believe that our brand is important to attracting and retaining
   Members. Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our brand depends
   largely on the success of our marketing efforts, ability to provide
   consistent, high-quality products, services, features, content, and
   support, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend
   our rights to use the Peloton mark, our P logo, and other
   trademarks important to our brand. We believe that the importance of
   our brand will increase as competition further intensifies and brand
   promotion activities may require substantial expenditures. Our brand
   could be harmed if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public
   image were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Unfavorable publicity
   about us, including our products, services, technology, customer
   service, content, personnel, and suppliers could diminish confidence
   in, and the use of, our products and services. Such negative publicity
   also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement and loyalty
   of our Member base and result in decreased revenue, which could have an
   adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating
   results.

   We have grown rapidly in recent years and have limited operating
   experience at our current scale of operations. If we are unable to
   manage our growth effectively, our brand, company culture, and
   financial performance may suffer.

   We have expanded our operations rapidly and have limited operating
   experience at our current size. For example, between June 30, 2017 and
   June 30, 2019, our employee headcount increased from 443 to 1,950, and
   we expect headcount growth


                                     19

   to continue for the foreseeable future. Further, as we grow, our
   business becomes increasingly complex. To effectively manage and
   capitalize on our growth, we must continue to expand our sales and
   marketing, focus on innovative product and content development, upgrade
   our management information systems and other processes, and obtain more
   space for our expanding staff. Our continued growth could strain our
   existing resources, and we could experience ongoing operating
   difficulties in managing our business across numerous jurisdictions,
   including difficulties in hiring, training, and managing a diffuse and
   growing employee base. Failure to scale and preserve our company
   culture with growth could harm our future success, including our
   ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and
   pursue our corporate objectives. Moreover, the vertically integrated
   nature of our business, where we design our own Connected Fitness
   Products, develop our own software, produce original fitness and
   wellness programming, sell our products exclusively through our own
   sales teams and e-commerce site, and deliver and service our Connected
   Fitness Products, exposes us to risk and disruption at many points that
   are critical to successfully operating our business and may make it
   more difficult for us to scale our business. If we do not adapt to meet
   these evolving challenges, or if our management team does not
   effectively scale with our growth, we may experience erosion to our
   brand, the quality of our products and services may suffer, and our
   company culture may be harmed.

   Our growth strategy contemplates a significant increase in our
   advertising and other marketing spending and expanding our retail
   showroom presence. Many of our existing retail showrooms are relatively
   new and we cannot assure you that these showrooms or that future
   showrooms will generate revenue and cash flow comparable with those
   generated by our more mature locations, especially as we move to new
   geographic markets. Further, many of our retail showrooms are leased
   pursuant to multi-year short-term leases, and our ability to negotiate
   favorable terms on an expiring lease or for a lease renewal option may
   depend on factors that are not within our control. We may also open
   additional production studios as we expand internationally, which will
   require significant additional investment. Successful implementation of
   our growth strategy will require significant expenditures before any
   substantial associated revenue is generated and we cannot guarantee
   that these increased investments will result in corresponding and
   offsetting revenue growth.

   Because we have a limited history operating our business at its current
   scale, it is difficult to evaluate our current business and future
   prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth.
   Our limited operating experience at this scale, combined with the
   rapidly evolving nature of the market in which we sell our products and
   services, substantial uncertainty concerning how these markets may
   develop, and other economic factors beyond our control, reduces our
   ability to accurately forecast quarterly or annual revenue. Failure to
   manage our future growth effectively could have an adverse effect on
   our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   We cannot compel third parties to license their music to us, and our
   business may be adversely affected if our access to music is limited.
   The concentration of control of content by major music licensors means
   that the actions of one or a few licensors may adversely affect our
   ability to provide our service.

   We enter into license agreements to obtain rights to use music in our
   service, including with major record companies (Sony Music
   Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group),
   independent record labels, major music publishers (Sony/ATV Music
   Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner/Chappell
   Music), and independent music publishers and administrators who
   collectively hold the rights to a significant number of sound
   recordings and musical compositions.

   Comprehensive and accurate ownership information for the musical
   compositions embodied in sound recordings is sometimes unavailable, or
   in some cases, impossible to obtain if withheld by the owners or
   administrators of such rights. In some cases, we obtain ownership
   information directly from music publishers, and in other cases we rely
   on the assistance of third parties to determine ownership information.

   If the information provided to us or obtained by such third parties
   does not comprehensively or accurately identify the ownership of
   musical compositions, or if we are unable to determine which musical
   compositions correspond to specific sound recordings, it becomes
   difficult or impossible to identify the appropriate rights holders to
   whom to pay royalties. This may make it difficult to comply with the
   obligations of any agreements with those rights holders or to secure
   the appropriate licenses with all necessary parties.

   Given the high level of content concentration in the music industry,
   the market power of a few licensors, and the lack of transparent
   ownership information for compositions, we may be unable to license a
   large amount of music or the music of certain popular artists, and our
   business, financial condition, and operating results could be
   materially harmed.


                                     20

   We are a party to many music license agreements that are complex and
   impose numerous obligations upon us that may make it difficult to
   operate our business, and a breach of such agreements could adversely
   affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

   Our license agreements are complex and impose numerous obligations on
   us, including obligations to, among other things:


     

   calculate and make payments based on complex royalty structures, which
   requires tracking usage of content in our service that may have
   inaccurate or incomplete metadata necessary for such calculation;


     

   provide periodic reports on the exploitation of the content in
   specified formats;


     

   represent that we will obtain all necessary publishing licenses and
   consents and pay all associated fees, royalties, and other amounts due
   for the licensing of musical compositions;


     

   comply with certain marketing and advertising restrictions;


     

   grant the licensor the right to audit our compliance with the terms of
   such agreements; and


     

   comply with certain security and technical specifications.

   Certain of our license agreements also contain minimum guarantees or
   require that we make minimum guarantee or advance payments, which are
   not always tied to our number of Subscribers or stream counts for music
   used in our service. Accordingly, our ability to achieve and sustain
   profitability and operating leverage in part depends on our ability to
   increase our revenue through increased sales of Subscriptions on terms
   that maintain an adequate gross margin. Our license agreements that
   contain minimum guarantees typically have terms of between one and
   three years, but our Subscribers may cancel their subscriptions at any
   time. We rely on estimates to forecast whether such minimum guarantees
   and advances against royalties could be recouped against our actual
   content costs incurred over the term of the license agreement. To the
   extent that our estimates underperform relative to our expectations,
   and our content costs do not exceed such minimum guarantees and advance
   payments, our margins may be adversely affected.

   Some of our license agreements also include so-called most-favored
   nations provisions, which require that certain terms (including
   material financial terms) are no less favorable than those provided to
   any similarly situated licensor. If agreements are amended or new
   agreements are entered into on more favorable terms, these most-favored
   nations provisions could cause our payment or other obligations to
   escalate substantially. Additionally, some of our license agreements
   require consent to undertake new business initiatives utilizing the
   licensed content (e.g., alternative distribution models), and without
   such consent, our ability to undertake new business initiatives may be
   limited and our competitive position could be impacted.

   If we breach any obligations in any of our license agreements, or if we
   use content in ways that are found to exceed the scope of such
   agreements, we could be subject to monetary penalties or claims of
   infringement, and our rights under such agreements could be terminated.

   In the past, we have entered into agreements that required us to make
   substantial payments to licensors to resolve instances of past use at
   the same time that we enter into go-forward licenses. These agreements
   may also include most-favored nations provisions. If triggered, these
   most favored nations provisions could cause our payments or other
   obligations under those agreements to escalate substantially. If we
   need to enter into additional similar agreements in the future, it
   could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
   condition, and operating results.

   Our business is affected by seasonality.

   Our business has historically been influenced by seasonal trends common
   to traditional retail selling periods, and we generate a
   disproportionate amount of sales activity related to our Connected
   Fitness Products during the period from November through February due
   in large part to seasonal holiday demand, New Years resolutions, and
   cold weather. For example, we generated approximately 64%, 63%, and 63%
   of our full fiscal year total revenue during the second and third
   quarters of fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Accordingly,
   adverse events that occur during these months could have a
   disproportionate effect on our operating results for the entire fiscal
   year. Moreover, as a result of higher sales during the period from
   November through February, our working capital needs are greater during
   the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. As a result of
   quarterly fluctuations caused by these and other factors, comparisons
   of our operating results


                                     21
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   across different fiscal quarters may not be accurate indicators of our
   future performance. Furthermore, our rapid growth in recent years may
   obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our
   business and may continue to affect our business. Accordingly, yearly
   or quarterly comparisons of our operating results may not be useful and
   our results in any particular period will not necessarily be indicative
   of the results to be expected for any future period. Seasonality in our
   business can also be affected by introductions of new or enhanced
   products and services, including the costs associated with such
   introductions.

   Our passion and focus on delivering a high-quality and engaging Peloton
   experience may not maximize short-term financial results, which may
   yield results that conflict with the markets expectations and could
   result in our stock price being negatively affected.

   We are passionate about continually enhancing the Peloton experience
   with a focus on driving long-term Member engagement through innovation,
   immersive content, technologically advanced Connected Fitness Products,
   and community support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term
   financial results. We frequently make business decisions that may
   reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the
   decisions are consistent with our goals to improve the Peloton
   experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over
   the long term. These decisions may not be consistent with the
   short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the
   long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our membership growth
   and Member engagement, and our business, financial condition, and
   operating results could be harmed.

   Our products and services may be affected from time to time by design
   and manufacturing defects that could adversely affect our business and
   result in harm to our reputation.

   We offer complex hardware and software products and services that can
   be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated
   operating system software and applications, such as those offered by
   us, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended
   operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in
   components and products that we source from third parties. Any such
   defects could make our products and services unsafe, create a risk of
   environmental or property damage and personal injury, and subject us to
   the hazards and uncertainties of product liability claims and related
   litigation. In addition, from time to time we may experience outages,
   service slowdowns, or errors that affect our fitness and wellness
   programming. As a result, our services may not perform as anticipated
   and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance that
   we will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the
   hardware, software, and services we offer. Failure to do so could
   result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting our
   products and services and could lead to claims against us. We maintain
   general liability insurance; however, design and manufacturing defects,
   and claims related thereto, may subject us to judgments or settlements
   that result in damages materially in excess of the limits of our
   insurance coverage. In addition, we may be exposed to recalls, product
   replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant
   and equipment, or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other
   expenses such as litigation costs and regulatory fines. If we cannot
   successfully defend any large claim, maintain our general liability
   insurance on acceptable terms, or maintain adequate coverage against
   potential claims, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
   Further, quality problems could adversely affect the experience for
   users of our products and services, and result in harm to our
   reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance,
   reduced demand for our products and services, delay in new product and
   service introductions, and lost revenue.

   If we fail to offer high-quality Member support, our business and
   reputation will suffer.

   Once our Connected Fitness Products are purchased, our Members rely on
   our high-touch delivery and set up service to deliver and install their
   equipment in a professional and efficient manner. Our Members also rely
   on our support services to resolve any issues related to the use of our
   Connected Fitness Products and content. Providing a high-quality Member
   experience is vital to our success in generating word-of-mouth
   referrals to drive sales and for retaining existing Members. The
   importance of high-quality support will increase as we expand our
   business and introduce new products and services. If we do not help our
   Members quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support,
   our reputation may suffer and our ability to retain and attract
   Members, or to sell additional products and services to existing
   Members, could be harmed.

   Our quarterly operating results and other operating metrics may
   fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes these metrics difficult
   to predict.

   Our quarterly operating results and other operating metrics have
   fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to
   quarter. Additionally, our limited operating history makes it difficult
   to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely on our
   past quarterly operating results as indicators of future performance.
   You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently
   encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial
   condition and operating results in any given quarter can be influenced
   by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are
   outside of our control, including:


     

   the continued market acceptance of, and the growth of the connected
   fitness and wellness market;


     

   our ability to maintain and attract new Subscribers;


     

   our development and improvement of the quality of the Peloton
   experience, including, enhancing existing and creating new Connected
   Fitness Products, services, technology, features, and content;


     

   the continued development and upgrading of our proprietary technology
   platform;


     

   the timing and success of new product, service, feature, and content
   introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the
   competitive landscape of our market;


     

   pricing pressure as a result of competition or otherwise;


     

   delays or disruptions in our supply chain;


     

   errors in our forecasting of the demand for our products and services,
   which could lead to lower revenue or increased costs, or both;

   increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may
   incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;


     

   the ability to maintain and open new showrooms;


     

   the continued maintenance and expansion of last mile delivery and
   maintenance services for our Connected Fitness Products;


     

   successful expansion into international markets, including Canada, the
   United Kingdom, and Germany;


     

   seasonal fluctuations in subscriptions and usage of Connected Fitness
   Products by our Members, each of which may change as our products and
   services evolve or as our business grows;


     

   the diversification and growth of our revenue sources;


     

   our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;


     

   constraints on the availability of consumer financing or increased down
   payment requirements to finance purchases of our Connected Fitness
   Products;


     

   system failures or breaches of security or privacy;


     

   adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related
   costs, including content costs for past use;


     

   changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with
   respect to privacy, consumer product safety, and advertising, or
   enforcement by government regulators, including fines, orders, or
   consent decrees;


     

   fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion
   of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;


     

   changes in our effective tax rate;


     

   changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations,
   or principles; and


     

   changes in business or macroeconomic conditions, including lower
   consumer confidence, recessionary conditions, increased unemployment
   rates, or stagnant or declining wages.

   Any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the
   factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our operating
   results.

   The variability and unpredictability of our quarterly operating results
   or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our
   expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with
   respect to revenue or other operating results for a particular period.
   If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our
   Class A common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly
   lawsuits, including securities class action suits.

   We rely on access to our production studios and the creativity of our
   fitness instructors to generate our class content. If we are unable to
   access or use our studios or if we are unable to attract and retain
   high-quality fitness instructors, we may not be able to generate
   interesting and attractive content for our classes.

   All of the fitness and wellness content offered on our platform is
   produced in one of our four production studios, three of which are
   located in New York City. Due to our reliance on a limited number of
   studios in a concentrated location, any incident involving our studios,
   or affecting New York City at-large, could render our studios
   inaccessible or unusable and could inhibit our ability to produce and
   deliver new fitness and wellness content for our Members. Production of
   the fitness and wellness content on our platform is further reliant on
   the creativity of our fitness instructors who, with the support of our
   production team, plan and lead our classes. Our standard employment
   contract with our fitness instructors has a fixed, multi-year term,
   however, our instructors may leave Peloton prior to the end of their
   contracts. If we are unable to attract or retain creative and
   experienced instructors, we may not be able to generate content on a
   scale or of a quality sufficient to grow our business. If we fail to
   produce and provide our Members with interesting and attractive content
   led by instructors who they can relate to, then our business, financial
   condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.

   We plan to expand into international markets, which will expose us to
   significant risks.

   We are currently expanding our operations to other countries, which
   requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us
   to regulatory, economic, and political risks in addition to those we
   already face in the United States. There are significant risks and
   costs inherent in doing business in international markets, including:


     

   difficulty establishing and managing international operations and the
   increased operations, travel, infrastructure, including establishment
   of local delivery service and customer service operations, and legal
   compliance costs associated with locations in different countries or
   regions;


     

   the need to vary pricing and margins to effectively compete in
   international markets;


     

   the need to adapt and localize products for specific countries,
   including obtaining rights to third-party intellectual property,
   including music, used in each country;


     

   increased competition from local providers of similar products and
   services;


     

   the ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights abroad;


     

   the need to offer content and customer support in various languages;


     

   difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws,
   regulations, and customs in other jurisdictions;


     

   compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
   Practices Act, or FCPA, and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or U.K. Bribery
   Act, by us, our employees, and our business partners;


     

   complexity and other risks associated with current and future legal
   requirements in other countries, including legal requirements related
   to consumer protection, consumer product safety, and data privacy
   frameworks, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation;


     

   varying levels of internet technology adoption and infrastructure, and
   increased or varying network and hosting service provider costs;


     

   tariffs and other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas and local content
   rules, as well as tax consequences;


     

   fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the requirements of
   currency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit
   conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars; and


     

   political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific
   country or region in which we operate, including, for example, the
   effects of Brexit, which could have an adverse impact on our
   operations in that location.

   We have limited experience with international regulatory environments
   and market practices and may not be able to penetrate or successfully
   operate in the markets we choose to enter. In addition, we may incur
   significant expenses as a result of our international expansion, and we
   may not be successful. We may face limited brand recognition in certain
   parts of the world that could lead to non-acceptance or delayed
   acceptance of our products and services by consumers in new markets. We
   may also face challenges to acceptance of our fitness and wellness
   content in new markets. Our failure to successfully manage these risks
   could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on
   our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   Increases in component costs, long lead times, supply shortages, and
   supply changes could disrupt our supply chain and have an adverse
   effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   Meeting customer demand partially depends on our ability to obtain
   timely and adequate delivery of components for our Connected Fitness
   Products. All of the components that go into the manufacturing of our
   Connected Fitness Products are sourced from a limited number of
   third-party suppliers, and some of these components are provided by a
   single supplier. Our manufacturers generally purchase these components
   on our behalf, subject to certain approved supplier lists, and we do
   not have long-term arrangements with most of our component suppliers.
   We are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times
   in the supply of these components and the risk that our suppliers
   discontinue or modify components used in our Connected Fitness
   Products. In addition, the lead times associated with certain
   components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in design,
   quantities, and delivery schedules. We may in the future experience
   component shortages, and the predictability of the availability of
   these components may be limited. In the event of a component shortage
   or supply interruption from suppliers of these components, we may not
   be able to develop alternate sources in a timely manner. Developing
   alternate sources of supply for these components may be time-consuming,
   difficult, and costly and we may not be able to source these components
   on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which may undermine our
   ability to fill our orders in a timely manner. Any interruption or
   delay in the supply of any of these parts or components, or the
   inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at
   acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, would harm
   our ability to meet our scheduled Connected Fitness Product deliveries
   to our customers.

   Moreover, volatile economic conditions may make it more likely that our
   suppliers may be unable to timely deliver supplies, or at all, and
   there is no guarantee that we will be able to timely locate alternative
   suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Further, since
   the beginning of 2018, there has been increasing rhetoric, in some
   cases coupled with legislative or executive action, from several U.S.
   and foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of
   certain materials. Several of the components that go into the
   manufacturing of our Connected Fitness Products are sourced
   internationally, including from China, where the United States has
   imposed tariffs on specified products imported therefrom following the
   U.S. Trade Representative Section 301 Investigation. These tariffs have
   an impact on our component costs and have the potential to have an even
   greater impact depending on the outcome of the current trade
   negotiations, which have been protracted and recently resulted in
   increases in U.S. tariff rates on specified products from China.
   Increases in our component costs could have a material effect on our
   gross margins. The loss of a significant supplier, an increase in
   component costs, or delays or disruptions in the delivery of
   components, could adversely impact our ability to generate future
   revenue and earnings and have an adverse effect on our business,
   financial condition, and operating results.

   Any major disruption or failure of our information technology systems
   or websites, or our failure to successfully implement upgrades and new
   technology effectively, could adversely affect our business and
   operations.

   Certain of our information technology systems are designed and
   maintained by us and are critical for the efficient functioning of our
   business, including the manufacture and distribution of our Connected
   Fitness Products, online sales of our Connected Fitness Products, and
   the ability of our Members to access content on our platform. Our rapid
   growth has, in certain instances, strained these systems. As we grow,
   we continue to implement modifications and upgrades to our systems, and
   these activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with
   replacing and upgrading these systems, including, but not limited to,
   impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders and other
   disruptions in our business operations. Further, our system
   implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level
   that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. If we fail to
   successfully implement modifications and upgrades or expand the
   functionality of our information technology systems, we could
   experience increased costs associated with diminished productivity and
   operating inefficiencies related to the flow of goods through our
   supply chain.

   In addition, any unexpected technological interruptions to our systems
   or websites would disrupt our operations, including our ability to
   timely ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements,
   manage our supply chain, sell our Connected Fitness Products online,
   provide services to our Members, and otherwise adequately serve our
   Members.

   Online sales of our Connected Fitness Products through
   www.onepeloton.com represented over 50% of our units sold in the U.S.
   for fiscal 2019. The operation of our direct to consumer e-commerce
   business through our website depends on our ability to maintain the
   efficient and uninterrupted operation of online order-taking and
   fulfillment operations. Any system interruptions or delays could
   prevent potential customers from purchasing our Connected Fitness
   Products.

   Moreover, the ability of our Members to access the content on our
   platform could be diminished by a number of factors, including Members
   inability to access the internet, the failure of our network or
   software systems, security breaches, or variability in Member traffic
   for our platform. Platform failures would be most impactful if they
   occurred during peak platform use periods, which generally occur before
   and after standard work hours. During these peak periods, there are a
   significant number of Members concurrently accessing our platform and
   if we are unable to provide uninterrupted access, our Members
   perception of our platforms reliability may be damaged, our revenue
   could be reduced, our reputation could be harmed, and we may be
   required to issue credits or refunds, or risk losing Members.

   In the event we experience significant disruptions, we may be unable to
   repair our systems in an efficient and timely manner which could have a
   material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
   operating results.

   Our operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to
   accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and services and
   adequately manage our inventory.

   To ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs
   and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with our
   suppliers and manufacturers, based on our estimates of future demand
   for particular products and services. Failure to accurately forecast
   our needs may result in manufacturing delays or increased costs. Our
   ability to accurately forecast demand could be affected by many
   factors, including changes in consumer demand for our products and
   services, changes in demand for the products and services of our
   competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and
   the weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future
   economic conditions. This risk may be exacerbated by the fact that we
   may not carry a significant amount of inventory and may not be able to
   satisfy short-term demand increases. If we fail to accurately forecast
   consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a
   shortage of products available for sale.

   Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory
   write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at
   discounted prices, which would cause our gross margins to suffer and
   could impair the strength and premium nature of our brand. Further,
   lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing
   capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies, which could result in
   lower margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand, our
   suppliers and manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet
   our requirements or we may be subject to higher costs in order to
   secure the necessary production capacity. An inability to meet consumer
   demand and delays in the delivery of our products to our customers
   could result in reputational harm and damaged customer relationships
   and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
   operating results.

   If we are unable to sustain pricing levels for our Connected Fitness
   Products and subscriptions, our business could be adversely affected.

   If we are unable to sustain pricing levels for our Bike, Tread, and
   subscription services, whether due to competitive pressure or
   otherwise, our gross margins could be significantly reduced. Further,
   our decisions around the development of new products and services are
   grounded in assumptions about eventual pricing levels. If there is
   price compression in the market after these decisions are made, it
   could have a negative effect on our business.

   Our revenue could decline due to changes in credit markets and
   decisions made by credit providers.

   Historically, a majority of our customers have financed their purchase
   of our Connected Fitness Products through third-party credit providers
   with whom we have existing relationships. If we are unable to maintain
   our relationships with our financing partners, there is no guarantee
   that we will be able to find replacement partners who will provide our
   customers with financing on similar terms, and our ability to sell our
   Connected Fitness Products may be adversely affected. Further,
   reductions in consumer lending and the availability of consumer credit
   could limit the number of customers with the financial means to
   purchase our products. Higher interest rates could increase our costs
   or the monthly payments for consumer products financed through other
   sources of consumer financing. In the future, we cannot be assured that
   third-party financing providers will continue to provide consumers with
   access to credit or that available credit limits will not be reduced.
   Such restrictions or reductions in the availability of consumer credit,
   or the loss of our relationship with our current financing partners,
   could have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, and
   operating results.

   Our future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key
   employees and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled
   personnel and senior management.

   Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to
   identify, attract, develop, integrate, and retain qualified and highly
   skilled personnel, including senior management, engineers, producers,
   designers, product managers, logistics and supply chain personnel,
   retail managers, and fitness instructors. In particular, we are highly
   dependent on the services of John Foley, our Chief Executive Officer
   and co-founder, who is critical to the development of our business,
   future vision, and strategic direction. We also heavily rely on the
   continued service and performance of our senior management team, which
   provides leadership, contributes to the core areas of our business and
   helps us to efficiently execute our business. Also imperative to our
   success are our fitness instructors, who we rely on to bring new,
   exciting, and innovative fitness and wellness content to our platform,
   and who act as brand ambassadors. If the senior management team,
   including any new hires that we make, fails to work together
   effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis
   then our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.

   Additionally, the loss of any key personnel could make it more
   difficult to manage our operations and research and development
   activities, reduce our employee retention and revenue, and impair our
   ability to compete. Although we have entered into employment offer
   letters with our key personnel, these agreements have no specific
   duration and constitute at-will employment. We do not maintain key
   person life insurance policies on any of our employees.

   Competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense, especially
   in New York City, where we have a substantial presence and need for
   highly skilled personnel. We may not be successful in attracting,
   integrating, or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or
   future needs. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to
   continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly
   skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, job
   candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the
   equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the
   perceived value of our Class A common stock declines, it may adversely
   affect our ability to hire or retain highly skilled employees. In
   addition, we may periodically change our equity compensation practices,
   which may include reducing the number of employees eligible for equity
   awards or reducing the size of equity awards granted per employee. If
   we are unable to attract, integrate, or retain the qualified and highly
   skilled personnel required to fulfill our current or future needs, our
   business and future growth prospects could be harmed.

   If we cannot maintain our One Peloton culture as we grow, we could
   lose the innovation, teamwork, and passion that we believe contribute
   to our success and our business may be harmed.

   We believe that a critical component of our success has been our
   corporate culture. We have invested substantial time and resources in
   building our One Peloton culture, which is based on the idea that if
   we work together, we will be more efficient and perform better because
   of one another. As we continue to grow, including geographically
   expanding our presence outside of our headquarters in New York City,
   and developing the infrastructure associated with being a public
   company, we will need to maintain our One Peloton culture among a
   larger number of employees, dispersed across various geographic
   regions. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect
   our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit
   personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate
   objectives.

   We have a limited operating history with which to evaluate and predict
   the profitability of our subscription model. Additionally, we may
   introduce new revenue models in the future.

   The majority of our Subscribers are on month-to-month subscription
   terms and may cancel their subscriptions at any time. We have limited
   historical data with respect to rates of Subscriber subscription
   renewals, so we may be unable to accurately predict customer renewal
   rates. Additionally, prior renewal rates may not accurately predict
   future Subscriber renewal rates for a variety of reasons, such as
   Subscribers dissatisfaction with our offerings and the cost of our
   subscriptions, macroeconomic conditions, or new offering introductions
   by us or our competitors. If our Subscribers do not renew their
   subscriptions, our revenue may decline and our business will suffer.

   Furthermore, in the future, we may offer new subscription products,
   implement promotions, or replace or modify current subscription models,
   any of which could result in additional costs. It is unknown how our
   Subscribers will react to new models and whether the costs or logistics
   of implementing these models will adversely impact our business. If the
   adoption of new revenue models adversely impacts our Subscriber
   relationships, then Subscriber growth, Subscriber engagement, and our
   business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.


                                     27

   Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to
   protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and
   brand.

   Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology and our
   patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and other intellectual property
   rights. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, a combination of
   trademark, trade dress, domain name, copyright, trade secret and patent
   laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our
   employees, contractors, consultants, and third parties with whom we
   have relationships, to establish and protect our brand and other
   intellectual property rights. However, our efforts to protect our
   intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective, and
   any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, which could
   result in them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid or
   unenforceable. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property
   rights will be sufficient to protect against others offering products,
   services, or technologies that are substantially similar to ours and
   that compete with our business.

   Effective protection of patents, trademarks, and domain names is
   expensive and difficult to maintain, both in terms of application and
   registration costs as well as the costs of defending and enforcing
   those rights. As we have grown, we have sought to obtain and protect
   our intellectual property rights in an increasing number of countries,
   a process that can be expensive and may not always be successful. For
   example, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign
   governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of
   procedural requirements to complete the patent application process and
   to maintain issued patents, and noncompliance or non-payment could
   result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application,
   resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in a relevant
   jurisdiction. Further, intellectual property protection may not be
   available to us in every country in which our products and services are
   available. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory
   licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third
   parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of
   patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or
   government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited
   or no benefit.

   In order to protect our brand and intellectual property rights, we may
   be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these
   rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual
   property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to
   management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of
   our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our
   intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims,
   and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our
   intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we may not be able to
   prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our
   intellectual property. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our
   intellectual property rights could seriously damage our brand and our
   business.

   We have been, and in the future may be, sued by third parties for
   alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.

   There is considerable patent and other intellectual property
   development activity in our market, and litigation, based on
   allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual
   property, is frequent in the fitness and technology industries.
   Furthermore, it is common for individuals and groups to purchase
   patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of
   making claims of infringement to extract settlements from companies
   like ours. Our use of third-party content, including music content,
   software, and other intellectual property rights may be subject to
   claims of infringement or misappropriation. We cannot guarantee that
   our internally developed or acquired technologies and content do not or
   will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. From time
   to time, our competitors or other third parties may claim that we are
   infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights,
   and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. Any claims or
   litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if
   successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial
   damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our
   platform or services or using certain technologies, force us to
   implement expensive work-arounds, or impose other unfavorable terms. We
   expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as
   the market for fitness products and services grows. Accordingly, our
   exposure to damages resulting from infringement claims could increase
   and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources.
   Further, during the course of any litigation, we may make announcements
   regarding the results of hearings and motions, and other interim
   developments. If securities analysts and investors regard these
   announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock
   may decline. Even if intellectual property claims do not result in
   litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and
   resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our
   management and require significant expenditures. Any of the foregoing
   could prevent us from competing effectively and could have an adverse
   effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   We rely heavily on third parties for most of our computing, storage,
   processing, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference
   with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect
   on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   We have outsourced our cloud infrastructure to third-party providers,
   and we currently use these providers to host and stream our services
   and content. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions
   experienced by these providers and we expect to experience
   interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future
   due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human,
   hardware or software errors, hosting disruptions, and capacity
   constraints. Outages and capacity constraints could arise from a number
   of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or
   security attacks. The level of service provided by these providers, or
   regular or prolonged interruptions in that service, could also affect
   the use of, and our Members satisfaction with, our products and
   services and could harm our business and reputation. In addition,
   hosting costs will increase as membership engagement grows, which could
   harm our business if we are unable to grow our revenue faster than the
   cost of using these services or the services of similar providers.

   Furthermore, our providers have broad discretion to change and
   interpret the terms of service and other policies with respect to us,
   and those actions may be unfavorable to our business operations. Our
   providers may also take actions beyond our control that could seriously
   harm our business, including discontinuing or limiting our access to
   one or more services, increasing pricing terms, terminating or seeking
   to terminate our contractual relationship altogether, or altering how
   we are able to process data in a way that is unfavorable or costly to
   us. Although we expect that we could obtain similar services from other
   third parties, if our arrangements with our current providers were
   terminated, we could experience interruptions on our platform and in
   our ability to make our content available to Members, as well as delays
   and additional expenses in arranging for alternative cloud
   infrastructure services.

   Any of these factors could further reduce our revenue, subject us to
   liability, and cause our Subscribers to decline to renew their
   subscriptions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition, and operating results.

   In addition, customers of certain of our providers have been subject to
   litigation by third parties claiming that the service and basic HTTP
   functions infringe their patents. If we become subject to such claims,
   although we expect our provider to indemnify us with respect to at
   least a portion of such claims, the litigation may be time consuming,
   divert managements attention, and, if our provider failed to indemnify
   us, adversely impact our operating results.

   We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in
   connection with content we produce, license, and distribute through our
   platform.

   As a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability
   for negligence, copyright, and trademark infringement, or other claims
   based on the nature and content of materials that we produce, license,
   and distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used
   in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We may decide
   to remove content from our service, not to place certain content on our
   service, or to discontinue or alter our production of certain types of
   content if we believe such content might not be well received by our
   Members or could be damaging to our brand and business.

   To the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks,
   including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on
   or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we
   produce, license or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to
   defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages
   arising from any liability could harm our results of operations. We may
   not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may
   not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.

   Some of our products and services contain open source software, which
   may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, technologies,
   products, and services in a manner that could harm our business.

   We use open source software in our products and services and anticipate
   using open source software in the future. Some open source software
   licenses require those who distribute open source software as part of
   their own software product to publicly disclose all or part of the
   source code to such software product or to make available any
   derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no
   cost. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject


                                     29
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   have not been interpreted by U.S or foreign courts, and there is a risk
   that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that
   imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to
   provide or distribute our products or services. Additionally, we could
   face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding
   release of, the open source software or derivative works that we
   developed using such software, which could include our proprietary
   source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the
   applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation
   and could require us to make our software source code freely available,
   purchase a costly license, or cease offering the implicated products or
   services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid
   infringement. This re-engineering process could require us to expend
   significant additional research and development resources, and we
   cannot guarantee that we will be successful.

   Additionally, the use of certain open source software can lead to
   greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open
   source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the
   origin of software. There is typically no support available for open
   source software, and we cannot ensure that the authors of such open
   source software will implement or push updates to address security
   risks or will not abandon further development and maintenance. Many of
   the risks associated with the use of open source software, such as the
   lack of warranties or assurances of title or performance, cannot be
   eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our
   business. We have processes to help alleviate these risks, including a
   review process for screening requests from our developers for the use
   of open source software, but we cannot be sure that all open source
   software is identified or submitted for approval prior to use in our
   products and services. Any of these risks could be difficult to
   eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have an adverse
   effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   Our Member engagement on mobile devices depends upon effective
   operation with mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that
   we do not control.

   A significant and growing portion of our Members access our platform
   through Peloton Digital and there is no guarantee that popular mobile
   devices will continue to support Peloton Digital or that mobile device
   users will use Peloton Digital rather than competing products. We are
   dependent on the interoperability of Peloton Digital with popular
   mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Android and
   iOS, and any changes in such systems that degrade the functionality of
   our digital offering or give preferential treatment to competitors
   could adversely affect our platforms usage on mobile devices.
   Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality mobile content, it is
   important that our digital offering is designed effectively and works
   well with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and
   standards that we do not control. We may not be successful in
   developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry
   or in developing products that operate effectively with these
   technologies, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is
   more difficult for our Members to access and use our platform on their
   mobile devices or Members find our mobile offerings do not effectively
   meet their needs, our competitors develop products and services that
   are perceived to operate more effectively on mobile devices, or if our
   Members choose not to access or use our platform on their mobile
   devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our
   platform, our Member growth and Member engagement could be adversely
   impacted.

   We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other
   Member data, which subjects us to legal obligations and laws and
   regulations related to security and privacy, and any actual or
   perceived failure to meet those obligations could harm our business.

   We collect, process, store, and use a wide variety of data from current
   and prospective Members, including personal information, such as home
   addresses and geolocation. Federal, state, and international laws and
   regulations governing privacy, data protection, and e-commerce
   transactions require us to safeguard our Members personal information.
   Although we have established security procedures to protect Member
   information, our or our third-party service providers security and
   testing measures may not prevent security breaches. Further, advances
   in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography,
   inadequate facility security, or other developments may result in a
   compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect Member data.
   Any compromise of our security or breach of our Members privacy could
   harm our reputation or financial condition and, therefore, our
   business.

   In addition, a party who circumvents our security measures or exploits
   inadequacies in our security measures, could, among other effects,
   misappropriate Member data or other proprietary information, cause
   interruptions in our operations, or expose Members to computer viruses
   or other disruptions. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to
   claims against


                                     30
   _______________________________________________________________________

   us. To the extent that the measures we or our third-party business
   partners have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may
   become subject to litigation, breach notification obligations, or
   regulatory or administrative sanctions, which could result in
   significant fines, penalties, or damages and harm to our reputation.
   Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of
   a data breach or other unauthorized access to our Member data, we may
   also have obligations to notify Members about the incident and we may
   need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit
   monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident.
   A growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted
   consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access
   to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. Such breach
   notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one
   jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause
   us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity
   surrounding any incident that compromises Member data.

   Furthermore, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to
   demands from individuals, privacy advocates, regulators, government
   agencies, and law enforcement agencies in various jurisdictions with
   conflicting privacy and security laws. This disclosure or refusal to
   disclose personal data may result in a breach of privacy and data
   protection policies, notices, laws, rules, court orders, and
   regulations and could result in proceedings or actions against us in
   the same or other jurisdictions, damage to our reputation and brand,
   and inability to provide our products and services to consumers in
   certain jurisdictions. Additionally, changes in the laws and
   regulations that govern our collection, use, and disclosure of Member
   data could impose additional requirements with respect to the retention
   and security of Member data, could limit our marketing activities, and
   have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
   operating results.

   Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our
   operations.

   Threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and
   sophisticated. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches,
   our products and services, as well as our servers, computer systems,
   and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable
   to cybersecurity risks, including cyber-attacks such as viruses and
   worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or
   electronic break-ins, third-party or employee theft or misuse, and
   similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our servers and
   computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our
   operations, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical
   data, unauthorized access to Member data, and loss of consumer
   confidence. In addition, we may be the target of email scams that
   attempt to acquire personal information or company assets. Despite our
   efforts to create security barriers to such threats, we may not be able
   to entirely mitigate these risks. Any cyber-attack that attempts to
   obtain our or our Members data and assets, disrupt our service, or
   otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if
   successful, could adversely affect our business, and financial
   condition and operating results, be expensive to remedy, and damage our
   reputation. In addition, any such breaches may result in negative
   publicity, and adversely affect our brand, impacting demand for our
   products and services, and could have an adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition, and operating results.

   We may be subject to warranty claims that could result in significant
   direct or indirect costs, or we could experience greater returns than
   expected, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business,
   financial condition, and operating results.

   We generally provide a minimum 12-month limited warranty on all of our
   Connected Fitness Products. The occurrence of any material defects in
   our Connected Fitness Products could make us liable for damages and
   warranty claims in excess of our current reserves, which could result
   in an adverse effect on our business prospects, liquidity, financial
   condition, and cash flows if warranty claims were to materially exceed
   anticipated levels. In addition, we could incur significant costs to
   correct any defects, warranty claims, or other problems, including
   costs related to product recalls. Any negative publicity related to the
   perceived quality and safety of our products could affect our brand
   image, decrease consumer and Member confidence and demand, and
   adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Also,
   while our warranty is limited to repairs and returns, warranty claims
   may result in litigation, the occurrence of which could have an adverse
   effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   In addition to warranties supplied by us, we also offer the option for
   customers to purchase third-party extended warranty and services
   contracts in some markets, which creates an ongoing performance
   obligation over the warranty period. Extended warranties are regulated
   in the United States on a state level and are treated differently by
   state. Outside the United States, regulations for extended warranties
   vary from country to country. Changes in interpretation of the
   insurance


                                     31
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   regulations or other laws and regulations concerning extended
   warranties on a federal, state, local, or international level may cause
   us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in
   the future. Our failure to comply with past, present, and future
   similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products,
   reputational damage, penalties, and other sanctions, which could have
   an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating
   results.

   We or our Subscribers may be subject to sales and other taxes, and we
   may be subject to liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and
   fees.

   The application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax,
   subscription sales tax, value-added tax, provincial taxes, goods and
   services tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like
   ours and to our Subscribers is a complex and evolving issue.
   Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax
   obligations. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain
   because it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our business.
   One or more states, the federal government, or other countries may seek
   to impose additional reporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax
   collection obligations on businesses like ours that offer subscription
   services and other fitness offerings. New taxes could also require us
   to incur substantial costs to capture data and collect and remit taxes.
   If such obligations were imposed, the additional costs associated with
   tax collection, remittance, and audit requirements could have an
   adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating
   results.

   We continue to analyze our exposure for taxes and liabilities and have
   accrued $5.7 million and $4.1 million for fiscal 2018 and 2019,
   respectively, for loss contingencies resulting from potential taxes and
   liabilities.

   From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, regulatory
   disputes, and governmental inquiries that could cause us to incur
   significant expenses, divert our managements attention, and materially
   harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   From time to time, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, government
   investigations, and other proceedings involving products liability,
   competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer
   protection, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes,
   and other matters that could adversely affect our business operations
   and financial condition. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the
   number and significance of these disputes and inquiries. Litigation and
   regulatory proceedings, and particularly the intellectual property
   infringement matters that we are currently facing or could face, may be
   protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict.
   Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or
   indeterminate amounts of damages and include claims for injunctive
   relief. Additionally, our litigation costs could be significant.
   Adverse outcomes with respect to litigation or any of these legal
   proceedings may result in significant settlement costs or judgments,
   penalties and fines, or require us to modify our products or services,
   make content unavailable, or require us to stop offering certain
   features, all of which could negatively affect our membership and
   revenue growth. See the section titled BusinessLegal Proceedings

   The results of litigation, investigations, claims, and regulatory
   proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and determining
   reserves for pending litigation and other legal and regulatory matters
   requires significant judgment. There can be no assurance that our
   expectations will prove correct, and even if these matters are resolved
   in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters,
   and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could
   harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   Changes in how we market our products and services could adversely
   affect our marketing expenses and subscription levels.

   We use a broad mix of marketing and other brand-building measures to
   attract Members. We use traditional television and online advertising,
   as well as third-party social media platforms such as Facebook,
   Twitter, and Instagram, as marketing tools. As television advertising,
   online, and social media platforms continue to rapidly evolve or grow
   more competitive, we must continue to maintain a presence on these
   platforms and establish a presence on new or emerging popular social
   media and advertising and marketing platforms. If we cannot cost
   effectively use these marketing tools or if we fail to promote our
   products and services efficiently and effectively, our ability to
   acquire new Members and our financial condition may suffer. In
   addition, an increase in the use of television, online, and social
   media for product promotion and marketing may increase the burden on us
   to monitor compliance of such materials and increase the risk that such
   materials could contain problematic product or marketing claims in
   violation of applicable regulations.

   An economic downturn or economic uncertainty may adversely affect
   consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products and
   services.

   Our products and services may be considered discretionary items for
   consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such
   discretionary items include general economic conditions, and other
   factors, such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions,
   fears of recession, the availability and cost of consumer credit,
   levels of unemployment, and tax rates. In recent years, the United
   States and other significant economic markets have experienced cyclical
   downturns and worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain. As global
   economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty
   remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain
   unpredictable and subject to reductions. To date, our business has
   operated almost exclusively in a relatively strong economic environment
   and, therefore, we cannot be sure the extent to which we may be
   affected by recessionary conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions
   may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and
   services and consumer demand for our products and services may not grow
   as we expect. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related
   fluctuation in consumer demand for our products and services could have
   an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating
   results.

   Covenants in the loan and security agreement governing our revolving
   credit facility may restrict our operations, and if we do not
   effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our
   financial condition could be adversely impacted.

   We entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement,
   the Credit Agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America,
   N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, and
   Silicon Valley Bank in June 2019, which amended and restated the loan
   and security agreement that we previously entered into in November
   2017, providing for a $250 million secured revolving line of credit.
   The term loan and revolving credit facility contains various
   restrictive covenants, including, among other things, minimum liquidity
   and revenue requirements, restrictions on our ability to dispose of
   assets, make acquisitions or investments, incur debt or liens, make
   distributions to our stockholders, or enter into certain types of
   related party transactions. These restrictions may restrict our current
   and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain
   changes in our business or industry, or take future actions. Pursuant
   to the agreement, we granted the parties thereto a security interest in
   substantially all of our assets. See the section titled Managements
   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
   OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCredit Agreement for
   additional information.

   Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants can be impacted by
   events beyond our control and we may be unable to do so. Our loan and
   security agreement provide that our breach or failure to satisfy
   certain covenants constitutes an event of default. Upon the occurrence
   of an event of default, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts
   outstanding under its debt agreements to be immediately due and
   payable. In addition, our lenders would have the right to proceed
   against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the loan and
   security agreement. If the debt under our loan and security agreement
   was to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be
   able to sell sufficient collateral to repay it, which would have an
   immediate adverse effect on our business and operating results. This
   could potentially cause us to cease operations and result in a complete
   loss of your investment in our Class A common stock.

   We may engage in merger and acquisition activities, which could require
   significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute
   stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results.

   As part of our business strategy, we acquired our first company in 2018
   and have made or may make investments in other companies, products, or
   technologies in the future. We may not be able to find suitable
   acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions
   on favorable terms, if at all, in the future. If we do complete
   acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position
   or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed
   negatively by Members or investors. Moreover, an acquisition,
   investment, or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating
   difficulties and expenditures, including disrupting our ongoing
   operations, diverting management from their primary responsibilities,
   subjecting us to additional liabilities, increasing our expenses, and
   adversely impacting our business, financial condition, and operating
   results. Moreover, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities and the
   anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business
   relationship may not be realized, if, for example, we fail to
   successfully integrate such acquisitions, or the technologies
   associated with such acquisitions, into our company.

   To pay for any such acquisitions, we would have to use cash, incur
   debt, or issue equity securities, each of which may affect our
   financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result
   in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt


                                     33
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject
   us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to
   manage our operations. Additionally, we may receive indications of
   interest from other parties interested in acquiring some or all of our
   business. The time required to evaluate such indications of interest
   could require significant attention from management, disrupt the
   ordinary functioning of our business, and could have an adverse effect
   on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   We may require additional capital to support business growth and
   objectives, and this capital might not be available to us on reasonable
   terms, if at all, and may result in stockholder dilution.

   We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with
   our net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to meet our
   anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. However, we intend
   to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may
   require additional capital to fund our business and to respond to
   competitive challenges, including the need to promote our products and
   services, develop new products and services, enhance our existing
   products, services, and operating infrastructure, and potentially to
   acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may
   need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds.
   There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be
   available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Our inability to obtain
   additional funding when needed could have an adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition, and operating results. If additional
   funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt
   securities, holders of our Class A common stock could suffer
   significant dilution, and any new shares we issue could have rights,
   preferences, and privileges superior to those of our Class A common
   stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve
   restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and
   other financial and operational matters, which may make it more
   difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business
   opportunities, including potential acquisitions.

   We are subject to payment processing risk.

   Our customers pay for our products and services using a variety of
   different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift
   cards, and online wallets. We rely on internal systems as well as those
   of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these
   payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and
   require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are
   disruptions in our payment processing systems, increases in payment
   processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as
   large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from
   payment processors, or changes to rules or regulations concerning
   payment processing, our revenue, operating expenses and results of
   operation could be adversely impacted. We leverage our third-party
   payment processors to bill Subscribers on our behalf. If these third
   parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on
   our behalf, we would have to find alternative methods of collecting
   payments, which could adversely impact Subscriber acquisition and
   retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use
   of payment methods, which could impact our results of operation and if
   not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer
   perceptions of our service.

   Our ability to use our net operating loss to offset future taxable
   income may be subject to certain limitations.

   As of June 30, 2019, we had U.S. federal net operating loss
   carryforwards, or NOLs, and state NOLs of approximately $112.6 million
   and $95.8 million, respectively, due to prior period losses which if
   not utilized will begin to expire for federal and state tax purposes
   beginning in 2036 and 2021, respectively. Realization of these NOLs
   depends on future income, and there is a risk that our existing NOLs
   could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax
   liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating results.

   In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
   amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an ownership
   change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to
   offset future taxable income. We have undergone two ownership changes
   on November 30, 2015 and April 18, 2017 and our NOLs arising before
   those dates are subject to one or more Section 382 limitations which
   may materially limit the use of such NOLs to offset our future taxable
   income. In addition, this offering, as well as future changes in our
   stock ownership, the causes of which may be outside of our control,
   could result in an additional ownership change under Section 382 of the
   Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under state laws. In addition,
   under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, tax losses
   generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be
   utilized to offset no more than 80% of taxable income annually. This
   change


                                     34
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   may require us to pay federal income taxes in future years despite
   generating a loss for federal income tax purposes. There is also a risk
   that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs,
   or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or
   otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For
   these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use
   of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability.

   We may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

   While we have historically transacted in U.S. dollars with the majority
   of our Subscribers and suppliers, we have transacted in some foreign
   currencies, such as the Canadian Dollar and U.K Pound Sterling, and may
   transact in more foreign currencies in the future. Further, certain of
   our manufacturing agreements provide for fixed costs of our Connected
   Fitness Products and hardware in Taiwanese dollars but provide for
   payment in U.S. dollars based on the then-current Taiwanese dollar to
   U.S. dollar spot rate. Accordingly, changes in the value of foreign
   currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can affect our revenue and
   operating results. As a result of such foreign currency exchange rate
   fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in
   our business and operating results. In addition, to the extent that
   fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our operating results to
   differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the
   trading price of our Class A common stock could be lowered. We do not
   currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in
   foreign currencies. However, in the future, we may use derivative
   instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to
   hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
   rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more
   than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable
   movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges
   are in place and may introduce additional risks if we are unable to
   structure effective hedges with such instruments.

   We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic
   sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our
   ability to compete in international markets.

   The United States and various foreign governments have imposed
   controls, export license requirements, and restrictions on the import
   or export of certain technologies. Our products may be subject to U.S.
   export controls, which may require submission of a product
   classification and annual or semi-annual reports. Compliance with
   applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products
   and services may create delays in the introduction of our products and
   services in international markets, prevent our international Members
   from accessing our products and services, and, in some cases, prevent
   the export of our products and services to some countries altogether.

   Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit
   the provision of products and services to countries, governments, and
   persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Even though we take precautions to
   prevent our products from being provided to targets of U.S. sanctions,
   our products and services, including our firmware updates, could be
   provided to those targets or provided by our Members. Any such
   provision could have negative consequences, including government
   investigations, penalties, reputational harm. Our failure to obtain
   required import or export approval for our products could harm our
   international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue.

   We could be subject to future enforcement action with respect to
   compliance with governmental export and import controls and economic
   sanctions laws that result in penalties, costs, and restrictions on
   export privileges that could have an adverse effect on our business,
   financial condition, and operating results.

   Failure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws,
   including the FCPA and similar laws associated with our activities
   outside of the United States, could subject us to penalties and other
   adverse consequences.

   We operate a global business and may have direct or indirect
   interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or
   state-owned or affiliated entities. We are subject to the FCPA, the
   U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S.
   Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and possibly
   other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which
   we conduct activities. These laws that prohibit companies and their
   employees and third-party intermediaries from corruptly promising,
   authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper
   payments or anything of value to foreign government officials,
   political parties, and private-sector recipients for the purpose of
   obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or
   securing any advantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required
   to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their
   transactions and have an adequate


                                     35

   system of internal accounting controls. In many foreign countries,
   including countries in which we may conduct business, it may be a local
   custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the
   FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. We face significant
   risks if we or any of our directors, officers, employees, agents or
   other partners or representatives fail to comply with these laws and
   governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek
   to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which
   could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation,
   operating results and financial condition.

   We have begun to implement an anti-corruption compliance program and
   policies, procedures and training designed to foster compliance with
   these laws, however, our employees, contractors, and agents, and
   companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may
   take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law. Any such
   violation could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business,
   operating results and prospects.

   Any violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws, or
   anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints,
   adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges,
   severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA,
   suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, any of which
   could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, business,
   operating results, and prospects. In addition, responding to any
   enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of
   managements attention and resources and significant defense costs and
   other professional fees.

   Changes in legislation in U.S. and foreign taxation of international
   business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies, as
   well as the application of such laws, could adversely impact our
   financial position and operating results.

   Recent or future changes to U.S., U.K. and other foreign tax laws could
   impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. We generally conduct
   our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries,
   branches, or representative offices and report our taxable income in
   various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in
   those jurisdictions. Further, we are in the process of implementing an
   international structure that aligns with our financial and operational
   objectives as evaluated based on our international markets, expansion
   plans, and operational needs for headcount and physical infrastructure
   outside the United States. The intercompany relationships between our
   legal entities are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations
   administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Although
   we believe we are compliant with applicable transfer pricing and other
   tax laws in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other relevant
   countries, due to changes in such laws and rules, we may have to modify
   our international structure in the future, which will incur costs, may
   increase our worldwide effective tax rate, and may adversely affect our
   financial position and operating results. In addition, significant
   judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining
   our provision for income taxes.

   During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and
   calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For
   example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
   earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower
   statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have
   higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
   or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws,
   regulations, principles, and interpretations. As we operate in numerous
   taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to
   diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities
   of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in
   different countries to have conflicting views with respect to, among
   other things, the manner in which the arms-length standard is applied
   for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of
   intellectual property.

   If U.S., U.K., or other foreign tax laws further change, if our current
   or future structures and arrangements are challenged by a taxing
   authority, or if we are unable to appropriately adapt the manner in
   which we operate our business, we may have to undertake further costly
   modifications to our international structure and our tax liabilities
   and operating results may be adversely affected.

   The requirements of being a public company, including maintaining
   adequate internal control over our financial and management systems,
   may strain our resources, divert managements attention, and affect our
   ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board
   members.

   As a public company we will incur significant legal, accounting, and
   other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We will be
   subject to reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
   1934, as amended, or the


                                     36
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley
   Act, the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, the rules and
   regulations of the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or
   Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations.
   Compliance with these rules and regulations will likely strain our
   financial and management systems, internal controls, and employees.

   The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual,
   quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and
   operating results. Moreover, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among
   other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and
   procedures, and internal control, over financial reporting. In order to
   maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and
   procedures, and internal control over, financial reporting to meet this
   standard, significant resources and management oversight may be
   required. In the course of preparing our financial statements for
   fiscal 2018, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control
   over financial reporting. If, in the future, we have material
   weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial
   reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our
   consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated.
   Effective internal control is necessary for us to produce reliable
   financial reports and is important to prevent fraud.

   In addition, we will be required to comply with the auditor attestation
   requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when we cease to
   be an emerging growth company. We expect to incur significant expenses
   and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance
   with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the
   Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result of the complexity involved in complying
   with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our
   managements attention may be diverted from other business concerns,
   which could harm our business, operating results, and financial
   condition. Although we have already hired additional employees to
   assist us in complying with these requirements, our finance team is
   small and we may need to hire more employees in the future, or engage
   outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses.

   We also expect that being a public company and complying with
   applicable rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to
   obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required
   to incur substantially higher costs to obtain and maintain the same or
   similar coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for
   us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors
   and qualified executive officers.

   We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over
   financial reporting and if our remediation of such material weaknesses
   is not effective, or if we fail to develop and maintain an effective
   system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial
   reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial
   statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be
   impaired.

   In the course of preparing our financial statements for fiscal 2018, we
   identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
   reporting. The material weakness had not been remediated as of June 30,
   2019. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of
   deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that
   there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
   annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
   detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified relate
   to information technology general controls, controls to address
   segregation of certain accounting duties, timely reconciliation and
   analysis of certain key accounts and the review of journal entries. We
   have concluded that these material weaknesses arose because, as a
   private company, we did not have the necessary business processes,
   systems, personnel and related internal controls necessary to satisfy
   the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public
   company.

   To address our material weaknesses, we have added personnel as well as
   implemented new financial systems and processes. We intend to continue
   to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses described above
   through hiring additional qualified accounting and financial reporting
   personnel, and further evolving our accounting processes. We will not
   be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps
   have been completed and have been operating effectively for a
   sufficient period of time.

   Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to
   date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to
   remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses
   in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will
   prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. Our current
   controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate
   because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses
   in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial
   reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or


                                     37

   maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their
   implementation or improvement could harm our operating results or cause
   us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a
   restatement of our financial statements for prior periods.

   Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to
   formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over
   financial reporting until after we are no longer an emerging growth
   company as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent
   registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in
   the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal
   control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating.
   Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over
   financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic
   management evaluations and annual independent registered public
   accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our
   internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be
   required to include in our periodic reports that are filed with the
   SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal
   control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose
   confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would
   likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A
   common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these
   requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global
   Select Market.

   If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting
   policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be
   adversely affected.

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
   accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and
   on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
   circumstances, as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of
   Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting
   Policies and Estimates. The results of these estimates form the basis
   for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities,
   and stockholders equity/deficit, and the amount of revenue and
   expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant
   assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial
   statements include those related to revenue related reserves, content
   costs for past use reserve, fair value measurements including common
   stock valuations, useful lives of property plant and equipment, product
   warranty, goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets, accounting for
   income taxes, stock-based compensation expense and commitments and
   contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our
   assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our
   assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the
   expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a
   decline in the price of our Class A common stock.

   Our reported financial results may be negatively impacted by the
   changes in GAAP.

   GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards
   Board, or FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and
   interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these
   principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our
   reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of
   transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a
   change. For example, in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
   or Topic 842, Leases, which requires recognition of lease assets and
   lease liabilities on the balance sheet by lessees for leases classified
   as operating leases with a term of more than 12 months. Topic 842 is
   effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
   after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
   We early adopted this standard as of July 1, 2019. The most significant
   change related to the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease
   liabilities on our balance sheet for real estate operating leases, as
   well as the de-recognition of the build-to-suit asset and liability.
   See Note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial
   statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for additional
   information.

   The forecasts of market growth included in this prospectus may prove to
   be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the
   forecasted growth, we cannot assure you that our business will grow at
   a similar rate, if at all.

   Growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based
   on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The
   forecasts in this prospectus relating to the expected growth in the
   connected fitness and wellness market, including estimates based on our
   own internal survey data, may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the
   market experiences the forecasted growth described in this prospectus,
   we may not grow our business at a similar rate, or at all. Our growth
   is


                                     38

   subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our
   business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties.
   Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth included in this prospectus
   should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.

   Our management team has limited experience managing a public company.

   Most members of our management team have limited experience managing a
   publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and
   complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public
   companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently
   manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant
   regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal
   securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and
   investors. These new obligations and constituents will require
   significant attention from our senior management and could divert their
   attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which
   could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating
   results.

   Our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, fire, power
   outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by
   manmade problems such as terrorism.

   Our business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes,
   fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist
   attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins, and similar events. The
   third-party systems and operations and manufacturers we rely on are
   subject to similar risks. For example, a significant natural disaster,
   such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, could have an adverse effect on
   our business, financial condition and operating results, and our
   insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that
   may occur. Acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan
   areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could also
   cause disruptions in our or our suppliers and manufacturers
   businesses or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient
   protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as natural
   disasters affecting locations that store significant inventory of our
   products, that house our servers, or from which we generate content. As
   we rely heavily on our computer and communications systems, and the
   internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer
   service, these disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run
   our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt suppliers and
   manufacturers businesses, which could have an adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition, and operating results.

   Regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur
   additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs
   of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products.

   We are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
   and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which will require us to conduct
   due diligence on and disclose whether or not our products contain
   conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could
   adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of the
   materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products.
   In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the
   disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting
   diligence procedures to determine the sources of minerals that may be
   used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable,
   potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a
   consequence of such due diligence activities. It is also possible that
   we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our
   products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we
   are unable to alter our products, processes, or sources of supply to
   avoid such materials.

   Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock

   There has been no prior public market for our Class A common stock, the
   stock price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline
   regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to
   resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price.

   There has been no public market for our Class A common stock prior to
   this offering. The initial public offering price for our Class A common
   stock was determined through negotiations between us and the
   underwriters and may vary from the market price of our Class A common
   stock following this offering. The market prices of the securities of
   newly public companies such as us have historically been highly
   volatile. The market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate
   significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond
   our control, including:


     

   overall performance of the equity markets and the performance of
   technology companies in particular;


                                     39
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

     

   variations in our operating results, cash flows, and other financial
   metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to
   analyst expectations;


     

   changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public or
   our failure to meet these projections;


     

   failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us,
   changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow
   our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations
   of investors;


     

   recruitment or departure of key personnel;


     

   the economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;


     

   negative publicity related to problems in our manufacturing or the real
   or perceived quality of our products, as well as the failure to timely
   launch new products or services that gain market acceptance;


     

   rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our
   industry;


     

   announcements by us or our competitors of new products, services,
   features and content, significant technical innovations, acquisitions,
   strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;


     

   new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or
   regulations applicable to our business;


     

   lawsuits threatened or filed against us, litigation involving our
   industry, or both;


     

   developments or disputes concerning our or other parties products,
   services, or intellectual property rights;


     

   other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents
   of terrorism, or responses to these events;


     

   the expiration of contractual lock-up or market standoff agreements;
   and


     

   sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders.

   In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and
   volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the
   market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of
   many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or
   disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In
   the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action
   litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become
   involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial
   costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our
   business, and adversely affect our business.

   Sales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial amount of our Class A
   common stock in the public markets by our existing security holders may
   cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.

   Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock
   into the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive
   officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these
   sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common
   stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through
   the sale of additional equity securities. Many of our existing security
   holders have substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the equity
   they hold, and may take, or attempt to take, steps to sell, directly or
   indirectly, their shares or otherwise secure, or limit the risk to, the
   value of their unrecognized gains on those shares. Based on zero shares
   of our Class A common stock and 235,942,233 shares of our Class B
   common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019, we will
   have                (                shares if the option to purchase
   additional shares is exercised in full) of our Class A common stock
   and                shares of our Class B common stock outstanding after
   this offering.

   All of the shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering will be
   freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the
   Securities Act except that any shares held by our affiliates, as
   defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, would only be able to be
   sold in compliance with Rule 144 and any applicable lock-up agreements
   described below. Approximately                  shares of Class A
   common stock, assuming no exercise of outstanding options, will be
   immediately available for sale in the public market. Approximately
                shares of our common stock are also subject to the lock-up
   agreement or market standoff agreements described below.

   In connection with this offering, subject to certain customary
   exceptions, we, all of our directors and executive officers, and
   substantially all of the holders of our common stock, or securities
   exercisable for or convertible into our common stock outstanding
   immediately prior to this offering, have entered into market standoff
   agreements with us or lock-up agreements with the underwriters that
   prohibit from selling, contracting to sell, granting any option for the
   sale of, transferring, or otherwise disposing of any shares of common
   stock, stock options, or any security or instrument related to common
   stock


                                     40

   or stock options without the permission of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and
   J.P. Morgan Securities LLC on behalf of the underwriters for a period
   of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, subject to early
   termination as described below.

   We have a large number of security holders and such security holders
   have acquired their interests over an extended period of time and
   pursuant to a number of different agreements containing a variety of
   terms governing restrictions on the sale, short sale, transfer,
   hedging, pledging, or other disposition of their interests in our
   equity. Holders of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock and
   securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares
   of our Class A common stock are subject to restrictions on their
   ability to sell or transfer their equity either prior to the pricing of
   this offering or from the pricing of this offering through the date
   that is 180 days after the date of this prospectus. We refer to such
   period as the lock-up period. Pursuant to the lock-up agreements with
   the underwriters, if (1) at least 120 days have elapsed since the date
   of this prospectus, (2) we have publicly released our earnings results
   for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred, and
   (3) such lock-up period is scheduled to end during or within five
   trading days prior to a broadly applicable period during which trading
   in our securities would not be permitted under our insider trading
   policy, or a blackout period, such lock-up period will end ten trading
   days prior to the commencement of such blackout period. We and the
   underwriters may release certain stockholders from the market standoff
   agreements or lock-up agreements prior to the end of the lock-up
   period. Record holders of our securities are typically the parties to
   the lock-up agreements with the underwriters and to the market standoff
   agreements with us referred to above, while holders of beneficial
   interests in our shares who are not also holders in respect of such
   shares are not typically subject to any such agreements or other
   similar restrictions. Accordingly, we believe that holders of
   beneficial interests who are not holders and are not bound by market
   standoff or lock-up agreements could enter into transactions with
   respect to those beneficial interests that negatively impact our stock
   price. In addition, an equity holder who is neither subject to a market
   standoff agreement with us nor a lock-up agreement with the
   underwriters may be able to sell, short sell, transfer, hedge, pledge,
   or otherwise dispose of or attempt to sell, short sell, transfer,
   hedge, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, their equity interests at any
   time after the closing of this offering. Any such transaction described
   above involving shares of our Class A common stock, or any perception
   by the market that such transaction may occur, could cause our stock
   price to decline.

   When the applicable lock-up and market standoff periods described above
   expire, we and our security holders subject to a lock-up agreement or
   market standoff agreement will be able to sell our shares in the public
   market. In addition, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities
   LLC, on behalf of the underwriters, may, in their sole discretion,
   release all or some portion of the shares subject to lock-up agreements
   prior to the expiration of the lock-up period. Sales of a substantial
   number of such shares upon expiration of the lock-up and market
   standoff agreements, or the perception that such sales may occur, or
   early release of these agreements, could cause our market price to fall
   or make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock at
   a time and price that you deem appropriate.

   In addition, as of June 30, 2019, we had stock options outstanding
   that, if fully exercised, would result in the issuance of 64,602,124
   shares of Class B common stock. All of the shares of Class B common
   stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, and the shares
   reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, will be
   registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly,
   these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon
   issuance subject to existing lock-up or market standoff agreements and
   applicable vesting requirements.

   Immediately following this offering, the holders
   of                shares of our Class B common stock will have rights,
   subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration
   statements for the public resale of the Class A common stock issuable
   upon conversion of such shares or to include such shares in
   registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders.

   We may also issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible
   into shares of our common stock from time to time in connection with a
   financing, acquisition, investment, or otherwise. Any further issuance
   could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and
   cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

   The dual class structure of our common stock will have the effect of
   concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our
   capital stock prior to the completion of this offering, including our
   directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders who will hold in the
   aggregate     % of the voting power of our capital stock following the
   completion of this offering, which will limit or preclude your ability
   to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and
   the approval of any change of control transaction.

   Our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common
   stock, which is the stock we are offering in this offering, has one
   vote per share. Following this offering, the holders of our outstanding
   Class B common stock will hold         % of the voting power of our
   outstanding capital stock, with our directors, executive officers, and
   holders of more than 5% of our common stock, and their respective
   affiliates, holding in the aggregate     % of the voting power of our
   capital stock. Because of the twenty-to-one voting ratio between our
   Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common
   stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined
   voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all
   matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until the earlier of
   (i) the date specified by a vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the then
   outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii) ten years from the
   closing of this offering, and (iii) the date the shares of Class B
   common stock cease to represent at least 1% of all outstanding shares
   of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude
   your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future,
   including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational
   documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially
   all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring
   stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage
   unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that
   you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.

   Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally
   result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to
   limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate
   planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A
   common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the
   relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who
   retain their shares in the long term. See the section titled
   Description of Capital StockAnti-Takeover Provisions for additional
   information.

   The dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the
   trading market for our Class A common stock.

   Certain stock index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones, exclude companies
   with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to
   certain stock indices, including the S&P 500. In addition, several
   stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors oppose the
   use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure
   of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common
   stock in such indices, may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish
   negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or
   otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure, and may
   result in large institutional investors not purchasing shares of our
   Class A common stock. Any exclusion from stock indices could result in
   a less active trading market for our Class A common stock. Any actions
   or publications by stockholder advisory firms or institutional
   investors critical of our corporate governance practices or capital
   structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common
   stock.

   We are an emerging growth company and intend to take advantage of the
   reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies
   which may make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.

   We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. We will
   remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last
   day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of
   $1.07 billion or more; (2) the last day of the fiscal year following
   the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of this offering;
   (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in
   nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; and (4) the date
   on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the
   rules of the SEC. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company,
   we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain
   disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies
   that are not emerging growth companies, including:


     

   not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
   of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;


     

   reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and


     

   exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote
   on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden
   parachute payments not previously approved.

   We currently intend to take advantage of the available exemptions
   described above. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens
   in this prospectus. In particular, we have not included all of the
   executive compensation information that


                                     42
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot
   predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive
   if we rely on these exemptions. Furthermore, under the JOBS Act,
   emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised
   accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to
   private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves
   of this accommodation allowing for delayed adoption of new or revised
   accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new
   or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not
   emerging growth companies. If some investors find our Class A common
   stock less attractive as a result of these decisions, there may be a
   less active trading market for our Class A common stock and the price
   of our Class A common stock may be more volatile.

   If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish
   inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of
   our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.

   The trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on
   the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish
   about us or our business, our market, and our competitors. We do not
   have any control over these analysts. If few securities analysts
   commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us,
   the trading price for our Class A common stock would be negatively
   affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our
   Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research
   about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely
   decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail
   to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock
   could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock price and
   trading volume to decline.

   An active public trading market may not develop or be sustained
   following this offering.

   Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A
   common stock. We have applied to list our Class A common stock on the
   Nasdaq Global Select Market, however, an active trading market may not
   develop following the completion of this offering or, if developed, may
   not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability
   to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price
   that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also
   reduce the market price of your shares of Class A common stock. An
   inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling
   shares or to acquire other companies or technologies by using our
   shares as consideration. We cannot predict the prices at which our
   Class A common stock will trade. The initial public offering price of
   our Class A common stock will be determined by negotiations between us
   and the underwriters and may not bear any relationship to the market
   price at which our Class A common stock will trade after this offering
   or to any other established criteria of the value of our business and
   prospects.

   Because the initial public offering price of our Class A common stock
   is substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per
   share of our outstanding common stock following this offering, new
   investors will experience immediate and substantial dilution.

   The initial public offering price is substantially higher than the pro
   forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately
   following this offering based on the total value of our tangible assets
   less our total liabilities. Therefore, if you purchase shares of our
   Class A common stock in this offering, based on the midpoint of the
   price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and the
   issuance by us of                shares of Class A common stock in this
   offering, you will experience immediate dilution of
   $                per share, the difference between the price per share
   you pay for our Class A common stock and its pro forma net tangible
   book value per share as of June 30, 2019. Furthermore, if the
   underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares, if
   outstanding stock options are exercised, if we issue awards to our
   employees under our equity incentive plans, or if we otherwise issue
   additional shares of our Class A common stock, you could experience
   further dilution. See the section titled Dilution for additional
   information.

   We will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds we receive
   in this offering and may not use them effectively.

   We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we
   receive in this offering, including for any of the purposes described
   in the section titled Use of Proceeds, and you will not have the
   opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether the
   net proceeds are being used appropriately. Because of the number and
   variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds
   from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from
   their currently intended use. If we do not use the net proceeds that we
   receive in this offering effectively, our business, financial


                                     43

Table of Contents

   condition, operating results, and prospects could be harmed, and the
   market price for our Class A common stock could decline. Pending their
   use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term,
   investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market
   accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and guaranteed
   obligations of the U.S. government that may not generate a high yield
   to our stockholders. These investments may not yield a favorable return
   to our investors.

   We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.

   We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock
   and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
   Additionally, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is
   limited by the restrictions under the terms of our loan and security
   agreement. We anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will retain
   all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business
   and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends
   in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors.
   Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock
   after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to
   realize any future gains on their investments.

   Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make
   an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more
   difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our
   current management, limit our stockholders ability to obtain a
   favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,
   officers, or employees, and limit the market price of our Class A
   common stock.

   Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated
   bylaws that will be in effect upon the completion of this offering may
   have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or
   other change of control of our company that the stockholders may
   consider favorable. In addition, because our board of directors is
   responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these
   provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to
   replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult
   for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among
   other things, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated
   bylaws include provisions that:


     

   provide that our board of directors will be classified into three
   classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;


     

   permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and
   fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;


     

   require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated
   certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;


     

   authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board
   of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;


     

   provide that only the chairman of our board of directors, our chief
   executive officer, or a majority of our board of directors will be
   authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;


     

   eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of
   stockholders;


     

   prohibit cumulative voting;


     

   provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with
   the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;


     

   provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our
   Class B common stock may have the ability to control the outcome of
   matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly
   less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock,
   including the election of directors and significant corporate
   transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its
   assets;


     

   prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all
   stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;


     

   provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make,
   alter, or repeal our bylaws; and


     

   establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to
   our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon
   by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.

   In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation will provide
   that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, to the fullest
   extent permitted by law, will be the exclusive forum for any derivative
   action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any


                                     44
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a
   claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation
   Law, or DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our
   restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is
   governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum
   provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a
   judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of
   our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage
   lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.
   This exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims that are vested
   in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court
   of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of
   Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter
   jurisdiction. For instance, the provision would not preclude the filing
   of claims brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the
   Exchange Act or Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder
   in federal court.

   Moreover, Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage, delay, or prevent a
   change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain
   restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions
   between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. See the
   section titled Description of Capital Stock for additional
   information.

   We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the

   We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current
   expectations and projections about future events and trends that we
   believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations,
   business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and
   objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are
   subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including
   those described in the section titled Risk Factors. Moreover, we
   operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New
   risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management
   to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on
   our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
   factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
   contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of
   these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and
   trends discussed in this prospectus may not occur and actual results
   could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied
   in the forward-looking statements.

   You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of
   future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the
   forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we
   believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
   statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
   performance, or

   prospectus or to conform these statements to actual results or revised
   expectations, except as required by law.

   You should read this prospectus and the documents that we reference in
   this prospectus and have filed with the SEC as exhibits to the
   registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with the
   understanding that our actual future results, performance, and events
   and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

                          INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA

   Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this prospectus
   concerning our industry and the markets in which we operate, including
   our general expectations, market position, market opportunity, and
   market size, is based on information from various sources, including
   our own estimates, as well as assumptions that we have made that are
   based on such data and other similar sources, and on our knowledge of
   the market for our products and services. This information involves a
   number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to
   give undue weight to such estimates. While we believe the market
   position, market opportunity, and market size information included in
   this prospectus is generally reliable, information of this sort is
   inherently imprecise. In addition, projections, assumptions, and
   estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the
   industry in which we operate is necessarily subject to a high degree of
   uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those
   described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this
   prospectus. These and other factors could cause results to differ
   materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the
   independent parties and by us.

   This prospectus contains statistical data, estimates, and forecasts
   that are based on industry publications or reports generated by
   third-party providers, or other publicly available information, as well

   Statistics and estimates related to our TAM and SAM are based on
   internal reports conducted with the assistance of our third-party
   marketing partner, Directions Research, Inc. In order to determine our
   TAM and SAM, we conducted an online survey of consumers across the
   United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada, surveying over
   1,000 consumers in each market. Consumers who qualified for our study
   were (i) between the ages of 18 and 70 years old and (ii) had
   self-reported household annual pre-tax incomes of $50,000 or more, or
   the foreign equivalent. Consumer responses to the survey were used as
   the basis for determining our TAM and SAM by weighting such responses
   to population censuses based on age and/or income. To calculate our
   TAM, we multiplied the percentage of respondents who reported having
   broadband internet and being open to subscription fitness by total
   households represented in the survey, and then weighted the response
   based on the relevant population censuses. To calculate our SAM, we
   measured the percentage of the TAM population who expressed interest in
   purchasing products within one of our existing categories. To better
   estimate a respondents likelihood to purchase one of our Connected
   Fitness Products, we made certain downward adjustments based on
   industry probability purchase assumptions, to account for conflicting
   responses from individual respondents, and where a respondents
   response relating to how much he or she would pay for a Peloton product
   was below the mean stated price by one standard deviation or more. Once
   each respondents probability of purchasing each product was
   determined, we weighted the responses based on the relevant population.
   We calculate the expected SAM for our product portfolio by multiplying
   the average weighted purchase probability for each product by the total
   country TAM.

   Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included
   elsewhere in this prospectus have been subject to rounding adjustments.
   Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables or charts may
   not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and
   figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as
   applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of
   the percentages that precede them.

                               USE OF PROCEEDS

   We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of
   shares of our Class A common stock in this offering at an assumed
   initial public offering price of $                per share, which is
   the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
   prospectus, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and
   estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
   $                million, or $                million if the
   underwriters option to purchase additional shares is exercised in
   full.

   A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering
   price of $                per share would increase (decrease) the net
   proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately
   $                million, assuming the number of shares of our Class A
   common stock offered by us remains the same, and after deducting the
   estimated underwriting discount. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of
   1,000,000 shares in the number of shares of our Class A common stock
   offered by us would increase (decrease) the net proceeds that we
   receive from this offering by approximately $                million,
   assuming that the assumed initial public offering price of
   $                remains the same, and after deducting the estimated
   underwriting discount.

   The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our
   capitalization and financial flexibility, create a public market for
   our Class A common stock, and enable access to the public equity
   markets for us and our stockholders. We primarily intend to use the net
   proceeds that we receive from this offering for working capital and
   other general corporate purposes, which may include research and
   development and sales and marketing activities, general and
   administrative matters, and capital expenditures. We may also use a
   portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in,
   technologies, solutions, or businesses that complement our business.
   However, we do not have binding agreements or commitments for any
   acquisitions or investments outside the ordinary course of business at
   this time.

   We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds of this
   offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from
   this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing
   securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit,
   commercial paper, and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.

                               DIVIDEND POLICY

   We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We

   A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering
   price of $                per share, which is the midpoint of the price
   range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase
   (decrease) our pro forma as adjusted cash and cash equivalents,
   additional paid-in capital, total stockholders (deficit) equity, and
   total capitalization by approximately $                million,
   assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the
   cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting
   the estimated underwriting discount. Similarly, each increase
   (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares in the number of shares offered by us
   would increase (decrease) our pro forma as adjusted cash and cash
   equivalents, additional paid-in capital, total stockholders (deficit)
   equity, and total capitalization by approximately
   $                million, assuming that the assumed initial public
   offering price, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on
   the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting
   the estimated underwriting discount. If the underwriters option to
   purchase additional shares is exercised in full, the pro forma as
   adjusted amount of each of cash and cash equivalents, additional
   paid-in capital, total stockholders (deficit) equity, and total
   capitalization would increase by approximately $                , after
   deducting the estimated underwriting discount and we would
   have                 shares of our Class A common stock and 235,942,233
   shares of our Class B common stock issued and outstanding, pro forma as
   adjusted.

   The number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common
   stock to be outstanding after this offering is based upon zero shares
   of our Class A common stock outstanding and 235,942,233 shares of our
   Class B common stock outstanding, in each case, as of June 30, 2019 and
   does not include:


     

   64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the
   exercise of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock
   outstanding as of June 30, 2019, with a weighted-average exercise price
   of $6.71 per share;


     

   664,050 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise
   of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted
   between June 30, 2019 and August 26, 2019 with an exercise price of
   $22.05 per share;


     

   240,000 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise
   of a warrant to purchase Class B common stock outstanding as of
   June 30, 2019, with an exercise price of $0.19 per share; and


     

                shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance
   under our equity compensation plans, consisting of (1) 9,085,593 shares
   of our Class B common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2015
   Plan as of June 30, 2019 (which reserve does not reflect the options to
   purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted after June 30,
   2019), (2)                 shares of our Class A common stock reserved
   for future issuance under our 2019 Plan, which will become effective on
   the date immediately prior to the date of this prospectus, and
   (3)                shares of our Class A common stock reserved for
   issuance under our 2019 ESPP, which will become effective on the date
   of this prospectus.

   On the date immediately prior to the date of this prospectus, any
   remaining shares available for issuance under our 2015 Plan will be
   added to the shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance
   under our 2019 Plan, and we will cease granting awards under the 2015
   Plan. Our 2019 Plan and 2019 ESPP also provide for automatic annual
   increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder. See the section
   titled Executive CompensationEmployee Benefit Plans for additional

                                  DILUTION

   If you invest in our Class A common stock, your interest will be
   diluted to the extent of the difference between the amount per share
   paid by purchasers of shares of Class A common stock in this initial
   public offering and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value
   per share of Class A common stock immediately after this offering.

   As of June 30, 2019, our pro forma net tangible book value was
   approximately $378.8 million, or $1.61 per share of common stock. Our
   pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the amount of
   our total tangible assets reduced by the amount of our total
   liabilities and divided by the total number of shares of our common
   stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019 after giving effect to (1) the
   redesignation of our outstanding common stock as Class B common stock
   on                , 2019, (2) the automatic conversion of all
   outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock
   outstanding as of June 30, 2019 into 210,640,629 shares of our Class B
   common stock, and (3) the filing and effectiveness of our restated
   certificate of incorporation.

   After giving effect to our sale in this offering of            shares
   of our Class A common stock, at an assumed initial public offering
   price of $            per share, which is the midpoint of the price
   range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after
   deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering
   expenses, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of
   June 30, 2019 would have been approximately $            million, or
   $            per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro
   forma net tangible book value of $            per share to our existing
   stockholders and an immediate dilution of $            per share to
   investors purchasing Class A common stock in this offering at the
   assumed initial public offering price.

   The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis to
   new investors:


               Assumed initial public offering price per share
                                         $

   Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2019, before
                       giving effect to this offering
                                       $

   Increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share attributable to
                       new investors in this offering






           Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share






   Dilution in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share to
                       new investors in this offering
                                         $





   A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering
   price of $             per share, which is the midpoint of the price
   range reflected on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase
   (decrease) our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share
   after this offering by $            per share and would increase
   (decrease) the dilution per share to new investors in this offering by
   $            per share, assuming the number of shares of Class A common
   stock offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,
   remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting
   discount. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares in
   the number of shares of Class A common stock offered by us would
   increase (decrease) the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value
   per share after this offering by $            per share and would
   increase (decrease) the dilution to new investors by $            per
   share, assuming the assumed initial public offering price, which is the
   midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
   prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated
   underwriting discount.

   If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares
   in full, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of
   our common stock after giving effect to this offering would be
   $            per share and the dilution in pro forma net tangible book
   value per share to investors in this offering would be $            per
   share.

   The following table summarizes, on a pro forma as adjusted basis as of
   June 30, 2019, after giving effect to the pro forma adjustments
   described above, the difference between existing stockholders and new
   investors purchasing shares of Class A common stock in this offering
   with respect to the number of shares purchased from us, the total
   consideration paid to us, and the average price per share paid by our
   existing stockholders or to be paid by investors purchasing shares in
   this

                        100%      $                      100%

















   A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering
   price of $            per share, which is the midpoint of the price
   range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase
   (decrease) total consideration paid by new investors and total
   consideration paid by all stockholders by $            million,
   assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the
   cover page of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting the
   estimated underwriting discount.

   Except as otherwise indicated, the above discussion and tables assume
   no exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares
   of our Class A common stock. If the underwriters exercise their option
   to purchase additional shares in full, our existing stockholders would
   own            % and our new investors would own                % of
   the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding after this
   offering.

   In addition, to the extent we issue any additional stock options or any
   outstanding stock options or warrant are exercised, or we issue any
   other securities or convertible debt in the future, investors will
   experience further dilution.

   The number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common
   stock to be outstanding after this offering is based upon zero shares
   of our Class A common stock outstanding and 235,942,233 shares of our
   Class B common stock outstanding, in each case, as of June 30, 2019:


     

   64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the
   exercise of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock
   outstanding as of June 30, 2019, with a weighted-average exercise price
   of $6.71 per share;


     

   664,050 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise
   of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted
   between June 30, 2019 and August 26, 2019 with an exercise price of
   $22.05 per share;


     

   240,000 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise
   of a warrant to purchase Class B common stock outstanding as of
   June 30, 2019, with an exercise price of $0.19 per share; and


     

                shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance
   under our equity compensation plans, consisting of (1) 9,085,593 shares
   of our Class B common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2015
   Plan as of June 30, 2019 (which reserve does not reflect the options to
   purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted after June 30,
   2019), (2)                 shares of our Class A common stock reserved

   On the date immediately prior to the date of this prospectus, any

   increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder. See the section

   Non-GAAP Financial Measures

   In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we
   believe the following non-GAAP financial measures are useful in
   evaluating our operating performance.

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin

   We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude: interest
   income, net; other income, net; provision for income taxes;
   depreciation and amortization expense; stock-based compensation
   expense; costs related to acquisitions; certain litigation expenses,
   consisting of legal settlements and related fees for specific
   proceedings that arise outside of the ordinary course of our business;
   and the ground lease expense related to build-to-suit lease
   obligations. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted
   EBITDA by total revenue.

   We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin as measures of
   operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. We
   believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors
   for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding
   and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are widely used by investors
   and securities analysts to measure a companys operating performance
   without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense,
   depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other (income)
   expense, net, and provision for income taxes that can vary
   substantially from company to company depending upon their financing,
   capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired;


     

   our management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in
   conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP
   for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual
   operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the
   effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial
   performance; and


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide consistency and
   comparability with our past financial performance, facilitate
   period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results, and also
   facilitate comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use
   similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.

   Our use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have limitations
   as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in
   isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as
   reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are, or may in the
   future be, as follows:


     

   although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges,
   the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in
   the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not
   reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or
   for new capital expenditure requirements;


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin exclude stock-based
   compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be
   for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our
   business and an important part of our compensation strategy;


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect: (1) changes
   in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) interest
   expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or
   principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or
   (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to
   us;


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect certain
   litigation expenses, consisting of legal settlements and related fees
   for specific proceedings, that arise outside of the ordinary course of
   our business;


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect the non-cash
   ground lease expense related to our new corporate headquarters lease
   whereby we are considered, for accounting purposes only, the owner of
   the construction project under current build-to-suit lease accounting;


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect transaction
   costs related to acquisitions; and


     

   the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of
   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may differ from the expenses
   and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from Adjusted
   EBITDA when they report their operating results and we may, in the
   future, exclude other significant, unusual or non-recurring expenses or
   other items from these financial measures.

   negative basis point impact on Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 711, 333, and
   180 for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.

   Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin

   We define Subscription Contribution as subscription revenue less cost
   of subscription revenue, adjusted to exclude from cost of subscription
   revenue, depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based
   compensation expense. Subscription Contribution Margin is calculated by
   dividing Subscription Contribution by subscription revenue.

   We use Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin
   to measure our ability to scale and leverage the costs of our Connected
   Fitness Subscriptions and measure Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime
   Value. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to
   investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in
   understanding and evaluating our operating results because our
   management uses Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution
   Margin in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance
   with GAAP for planning purposes, including the preparation of our
   annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and
   the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our
   financial performance.

   Our use of Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution
   Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not
   consider these in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our
   financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are
   as follows:


     

   although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges,
   the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in
   the future, and Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution
   Margin do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such
   replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and

   Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin exclude

   Because of these limitations, Subscription Contribution and

   material in our content in exchange for a mutually-agreed payment. We
   refer to these payments as content costs for past use. Included in
   Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin are
   content costs for past use. These costs had a negative basis point

   Overview of Our Business and History

   Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a
   loyal community of over 1.4 million Members. We pioneered connected,
   technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive,
   instructor-led boutique classes to our Members anytime, anywhere. We
   make fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient
   while fostering social connections that encourage our Members to be the
   best versions of themselves.

   Key milestones in our growth history include:

   We define a Member as any individual who has a Peloton account. We
   define a Connected Fitness Subscriber as either a paid Connected
   Fitness Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription with a successful
   credit card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers) or
   a paused Connected Fitness Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription
   where the Subscriber has requested to Pause for up to 3 months). We
   define a Digital Subscriber as an individual or household that has a
   paid Peloton Digital subscription with a successful credit card
   billing.


   **

   Total Global Subscribers represents the aggregate number of Connected
   Fitness Subscribers and Digital Subscribers. As of June 30, 2019, we
   had approximately 613,000 Global Subscribers.

   Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our Connected
   Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue. We have
   experienced significant growth in sales of our Connected Fitness
   Products, which, when combined with our low Average Net Monthly
   Connected Fitness Churn has led to significant growth in Connected
   Fitness Subscribers. From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019, total revenue
   grew 110%, and our Connected Fitness Subscriber base grew 108%.

   For fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019:


     

   We generated total revenue of $218.6 million, $435.0 million, and
   $915.0 million, respectively, representing 99.0% and 110.3%
   year-over-year growth;


     

   As of June 30, 2017, June 30, 2018, and June 30, 2019, we had 107,708,
   245,667, and 511,202 Connected Fitness Subscribers, respectively,
   representing 128.1% and 108.1% year-over-year growth;


     

   Our Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn was 0.70%, 0.64%, and
   0.65%, respectively;


     

   We incurred net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and
   $(195.6) million, respectively; and


     

   Our Adjusted EBITDA was $(51.8) million, $(30.4) million, and $(71.3)
   million, respectively.

   For a definition of Connected Fitness Subscribers, Average Net Monthly
   Connected Fitness Churn, Subscription Contribution Margin, and Adjusted
   EBITDA, see the section titled Key Operational and Business Metrics.

   See the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other
   DataNon-GAAP Financial Measures for information regarding our use of
   Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA.

   As a supplement to our key operational and business metrics described
   herein, we also measure our number of Members to understand the scale
   of our platform and market penetration. Unlike our number of Connected
   Fitness Subscriptions or Digital Subscriptions, a Member represents a
   single individual who has a Peloton account. It is often the case that
   a Connected Fitness Subscription or Digital Subscription is used by
   multiple members of a single family that each have individual Peloton
   accounts. As of June 30, 2019, we had over 1.4 million Members and the
   average Connected Fitness Subscription was used by 2.0 Members.

   Our Business Model

   Our financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong
   retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer
   acquisition.

   Grow Our Connected Fitness Subscriber Base

   We are still in the early stages of growth. As of June 30, 2019, we had
   sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products globally, a small
   fraction of the 14 million products we believe reflect our SAM in our
   current and announced markets (the United States, the United Kingdom,
   Canada, and Germany) and current fitness product verticals. We believe
   our success in growing our Connected Fitness Subscriber base is due to
   our data-driven marketing and education-based multi-channel sales
   efforts, word-of-mouth referrals from our loyal Members, and broadening
   customer demographics. In order to grow our Connected Fitness
   Subscriber base, we plan to drive sales of our Connected Fitness
   Products by continuing to increase consumer awareness through brand and
   product marketing, the introduction of new Connected Fitness Products
   in existing and new fitness and wellness verticals, and geographical
   expansion.

   In addition to our Connected Fitness Subscription for $39.00 per month,
   we also offer a Digital Subscription for $19.49 per month. As of
   June 30, 2019, we had approximately 102,000 Digital Subscribers. In
   2018, we relaunched Peloton Digital


                                     61
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   when we expanded our content offering to include bootcamp and
   indoor/outdoor running and walking classes. Later in 2018, we
   significantly expanded our yoga content offering and launched
   meditation. While we believe we can grow our Digital Subscriber base
   over time, the focus of Peloton Digital today is to increase engagement
   with our Connected Fitness Subscribers. In addition, Peloton Digital
   provides users an opportunity to try Peloton content before they
   purchase a Connected Fitness Product.

   Increase Engagement to Drive High Retention

   By making fitness fun and motivating, we help our Members achieve their
   personal goals. We continuously improve our platform, which results in
   increased usage of our Connected Fitness Products and Peloton Digital.
   We analyze millions of workouts per month to help us develop new
   software features that improve our Member experience, as well as create
   new on-trend fitness and wellness content. We also develop innovative
   fitness programs and goal-based challenges to help Members feel more
   accountable and motivated. As our community of Members continues to
   grow, the Peloton fitness experience becomes more inspiring, more
   competitive, more immersive, and more connected, fueling the desire of
   each of our Members to achieve their fitness goals.

   Engagement is the leading indicator of retention for our Connected
   Fitness Subscribers. We have consistently seen an increase in Average
   Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber. Total Workouts
   completed by our Connected Fitness Subscribers have grown significantly
   over the past few years. We evaluate engagement on a year-over-year
   basis given the seasonality in our Members workout patterns. Our third
   quarter tends to have elevated workout levels due to New Years
   resolutions and colder weather. Our first quarter tends to have lower
   workout levels as Members enjoy outdoor-based fitness activities and
   summer vacations.

   For a definition of Workouts, Total Workouts, and Average Monthly
   Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber, see the section titled Key
   Operational and Business Metrics.

                                    LOGO

   We have seen an increase in engagement over time, across our cohorts of
   Connected Fitness Subscribers. Average Monthly Workouts per Connected
   Fitness Subscriber are higher for our most recent cohorts and
   engagement for each cohort has been consistent or improved over time.
   For example, the fiscal 2017 cohort includes all Connected Fitness
   Subscribers who joined Peloton between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017.

                                    LOGO

   Improve Profitability through Scaling Content Platform

   The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base will
   allow us to improve Subscription Contribution Margin, increase
   Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, and generate operating
   leverage. We will be able to leverage a significant portion of our
   content creation costs given that we only need a limited number of
   production studios and instructors to support our growth.

   We measure Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution
   Margin to understand and evaluate the profitability of our subscription
   business and Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. For a
   definition of Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution
   Margin, see the section titled Key Operational and Business Metrics.
   Our subscription gross margin for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 was 9.7%,
   43.3%, and 42.7%, respectively. The increase in our subscription gross
   margin from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by content
   costs for past use, which, while relatively flat on an aggregate dollar
   basis, more adversely impacted subscription gross margin for fiscal
   2017 given a lower Connected Fitness Subscriber base. We also drove
   further margin improvements in fiscal 2018 by leveraging fixed costs of
   content production while expanding our Connected Fitness Subscriber
   base. Subscription gross margin decreased during fiscal 2019 as we
   began to make significant investments in Tread content as well as
   expansion into new content verticals. We also began incurring expenses
   for our new production studios in New York City and London and incurred
   additional content costs for past use in fiscal 2019. Our Subscription
   Contribution Margin for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 was 13.5%, 47.5%,
   and 50.8%, respectively. When excluding content costs for past use, in
   fiscal 2019 we experienced a decline in our Subscription Contribution
   Margin which was driven by additional investments in new content
   verticals in the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019.
   See the section titled Content Costs for Past Use for additional
   information. To support the launch of our Tread, we leased a new studio
   in New York City and added hundreds of original programs including
   bootcamp and indoor/outdoor running and walking classes. In late 2018,
   we significantly expanded our


                                     63
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   yoga offering and launched meditation. We view the majority of these
   costs as fixed and scalable over time as we grow our Subscriber base.
   For a discussion of these recent growth initiatives see the section
   titled Factors Affecting Our PerformanceAbility to Invest.

   We expect to benefit from continued efficiencies in sales and marketing
   expenses resulting from increasing brand awareness, word-of-mouth
   referrals from our growing Member base, and further optimization of our
   sales and marketing investments by channel. We also expect to achieve
   operating leverage as we scale fixed general and administrative
   expenses, including those associated with our new headquarters in New
   York City.

   Maintain Compelling Unit Economics

   Our unit economic model benefits from low Average Net Monthly Connected
   Fitness Churn and high Subscription Contribution Margin. When we
   acquire a new Connected Fitness Subscriber, we offset sales and
   marketing investments with the gross profit earned on the sale of
   Connected Fitness Products, allowing for rapid payback. Thereafter, we
   earn recurring, high-margin subscription revenue. To illustrate our
   compelling unit economic model, we have presented our Connected Fitness
   Subscriber Lifetime Value and Net Customer Acquisition costs for fiscal
   2017, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019.

   We have a high Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, which can
   be calculated as:


     

   our monthly Connected Fitness Subscription fee of $39.00; multiplied by


     

   Connected Fitness Subscribers added in a period; multiplied by


     

   months of Subscription Lifetime implied by our Average Net Monthly
   Connected Fitness Churn in the period (calculated by dividing one by
   our Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn); multiplied by


     

   (Subscription Contribution plus content costs for past use) divided by
   subscription revenue.

   Our Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value for fiscal 2017, fiscal
   2018, and fiscal 2019, was $267.1 million, $604.4 million, and $1,053.8
   million, respectively, or $3,433, $4,015, and $3,593 per Connected
   Fitness Subscriber, respectively.

   As we expand our content offering, develop new interactive software
   features, and grow our community of Members, we believe we can maintain
   a low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, resulting in a high
   Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. In addition, with the
   growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base over time, we expect to
   improve our Subscription Contribution Margin as we scale our fixed
   content production costs.

   Net Customer Acquisition Cost (profit) can be calculated as Adjusted
   Sales and Marketing Expense (which excludes depreciation and
   amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense) less
   Adjusted Connected Fitness Product Gross Profit (which excludes
   depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation
   expense). Our Net Customer Acquisition Costs (profit) for fiscal 2017,
   fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019, was $14.2 million, $(4.9) million, and
   $1.6 million, respectively, or $183, $(33), and $5 per Connected
   Fitness Subscriber added, respectively. We believe we will continue to
   drive rapid payback and efficiencies in Net Customer Acquisition Costs
   (profit) by further leveraging sales and marketing investments as a
   result of heightened brand awareness and growing word-of-mouth
   referrals. Changes in Connected Fitness Product margins or sales and
   marketing expenses may result in an inability to fully offset our
   customer acquisition costs.

   Factors Affecting Our Performance

   Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will
   continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the
   following:

   Ability to Attract New Connected Fitness Subscribers and Scale Our
   Platform

   Our long-term growth will depend in part on our continued ability to
   attract new Connected Fitness Subscribers. We are still in the early
   stages of growth in our existing markets and believe we can
   significantly grow our Connected Fitness Subscriber base. If we cannot
   attract new Connected Fitness Subscribers as quickly as we expect, our
   operating results may be adversely affected. The inability to grow our
   Connected Fitness Subscriber base would reduce efficiency in customer
   acquisition costs and slow operating margin improvement.


                                     64
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   To increase affordability and expand our addressable market, we offer
   attractive financing programs for qualified customers. We report
   revenue net of third-party financing partner fees. Accordingly, to the
   extent that these third-party financing partner fees change, or the
   number of products purchased through our financing programs fluctuates,
   our revenue and Subscription Contribution Margin will be affected.

   Ability to Engage and Retain Our Existing Connected Fitness Subscribers

   Our long-term growth will partially depend on our continued ability to
   retain existing Connected Fitness Subscribers. Engagement is the
   leading indicator of retention for our Connected Fitness Subscribers,
   and we must continue to provide an experience that our Members love. We
   cannot be sure that we will be successful in engaging and retaining
   Connected Fitness Subscribers, or that retention levels will not
   materially decline due to any number of factors, such as harm to our
   brand, or our inability to anticipate and meet consumer preferences and
   successfully implement new software features and content to meet those
   demands.

   Ability to Invest

   We will continue to make investments across our business to drive
   growth, and therefore we expect expenses to increase. We will continue
   to invest significant resources in sales and marketing to drive demand
   for our products and services. We will also continue to invest in
   research and development to enhance our platform, develop new Connected
   Fitness Products and software features, update and expand our content
   offering, and improve our infrastructure. For example, during fiscal
   2019, we added eight new instructors and opened a temporary New York
   City production studio to produce bootcamp and indoor/outdoor running
   and walking classes. To support our rapid growth, we also intend to
   continue investing in our supply chain and logistics operations. We
   have in the past made, and may also in the future make, acquisitions or
   investments in strategic partnerships to further drive our growth. As
   cost of revenue, operating expenses, and capital expenditures increase
   as we invest in our business for long-term growth, we are likely to
   experience additional losses, delaying our ability to achieve
   profitability and adversely affecting cash flows.

   Ability to Grow in New Geographies

   Entering new geographic markets requires us to invest in sales and
   marketing, infrastructure, and personnel, including by establishing
   additional offices, showrooms, and potentially smaller local production
   studios. Our international growth will depend on our ability to sell
   Connected Fitness Products and associated Connected Fitness
   Subscriptions in international markets. Our international expansion has
   resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs and is
   subject to a variety of risks, including local competition, content
   localization, multilingual customer support, potentially complex
   delivery logistics, and compliance with foreign laws and regulations.

   Seasonality

   Historically, we have experienced higher revenue in the second and
   third quarters of the fiscal year compared to other quarters, due in
   large part to seasonal holiday demand, New Years resolutions, and cold
   weather. For example, in fiscal 2018 and 2019, our second and third
   quarters combined each represented 63% and 63% of our total revenue. We
   also incur higher sales and marketing expenses during these periods,
   which we expect to continue.

   Connected Fitness Subscribers

   Our ability to expand the number of Connected Fitness Subscribers is an
   indicator of our market penetration and growth. A Connected Fitness
   Subscriber can represent a person, household or commercial property,
   such as a hotel or residential building.

   A Connected Fitness Subscription is either a paid Connected Fitness
   Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription with a successful credit
   card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers) or paused
   Connected Fitness Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription where
   the Subscriber has requested to Pause for up to 3 months). We do not
   include canceled or unpaid Connected Fitness Subscriptions in the
   Connected Fitness Subscriber count.

   Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn

   We use Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn to measure the
   retention of our Connected Fitness Subscribers. We define Average Net
   Monthly Connected Fitness Churn as Connected Fitness Subscriber
   cancellations, net of reactivations, in the quarter, divided by the
   average number of beginning Connected Fitness Subscribers in each
   month, divided by three months. This metric does not include data
   related to our Digital Subscribers.

   Total Workouts and Average Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness
   Subscriber

   We review Total Workouts and Average Monthly Workouts per Connected
   Fitness Subscriber to measure engagement, which is the leading
   indicator of retention for our Connected Fitness Subscribers. We define
   Total Workouts as all workouts completed during a given period. We
   define a Workout as a Connected Fitness Subscriber either completing at
   least 50% of an instructor-led or scenic ride or run or ten or more
   minutes of Just Ride or Just Run mode. We define Average Monthly
   Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber as the Total Workouts
   completed in the quarter divided by the average number of Connected
   Fitness Subscribers in each month, divided by three months.

   Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin

   We use Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin
   to measure our ability to scale and leverage the costs of our Connected
   Fitness Subscriptions and measure Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime
   Value. The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base
   will allow us to improve our Subscription Contribution Margin and


                                     66
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   aggregate Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. While there are
   variable costs, including music royalties, associated with our
   Connected Fitness Subscriptions, a significant portion of our content
   creation costs are fixed given that we operate with a limited number of
   production studios and instructors. The fixed nature of those expenses
   should scale over time as we grow our Connected Fitness Subscriber
   base.

   We define Subscription Contribution as subscription revenue less cost
   of subscription revenue, adjusted to exclude depreciation and
   amortization expense, and stock-based compensation expense.
   Subscription Contribution Margin is calculated by dividing Subscription
   Contribution by subscription revenue. See the section titled Selected
   Consolidated Financial and Other DataSubscription Contribution and
   Subscription Contribution Margin for information regarding our use of
   Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin and a
   reconciliation of Subscription Contribution to subscription gross

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are key performance measures
   that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the
   operating leverage in our business. Because Adjusted EBITDA and
   Adjusted EBITDA Margin facilitate internal comparisons of our
   historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use
   these measures for business planning purposes. We also believe this
   information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of
   our operating performance and better identify trends in our business.
   We expect Adjusted EBITDA Margin to increase over the long-term as we
   continue to scale our business and achieve greater leverage in our
   operating expenses.

   We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude other
   (expense) income, provision for (benefit from) income taxes,
   depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation
   expense, transaction costs, certain litigation expenses, consisting of
   legal settlements and related fees for specific proceedings that arise
   outside of the ordinary course of our business, and non-cash ground
   lease expense related to build-to-suit obligations. Adjusted EBITDA
   Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. See
   the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other
   DataAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for information
   regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted
   EBITDA to net loss.

   Components of our Operating Results

   We operate and manage our business in three reportable segments:
   Connected Fitness Products, Subscription, and Other. We identify our
   reportable segments based on the information used by management to
   monitor performance and make operating decisions. See Note 17 of the
   notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
   this prospectus for additional information regarding our reportable
   segments.

   Revenue

   Connected Fitness Products

   Connected Fitness Product revenue consists of sales of our Bike and
   Tread and related accessories, associated fees for delivery and
   installation, and extended warranty agreements. Connected Fitness
   Product revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and is recorded
   net of returns and discounts and third-party financing program fees.

   Subscription

   Subscription revenue consists of revenue generated from our monthly
   $39.00 Connected Fitness Subscription and $19.49 Digital Subscription.
   Subscription revenue also includes revenue generated from guests who
   pay to take a live class in one of our studios, which has been
   immaterial to date.

   Historically, we offered a prepaid subscription option where Members
   earned one free month or three free months of subscription with the
   upfront purchase of a 12-month subscription or 24-month subscription,
   respectively. We also offered Connected Fitness Subscribers the ability
   to purchase a 12-, 24-, or 39-month prepaid subscription with the
   purchase of a Connected Fitness Product as part of our financing
   program, which provides 0% APR financing to qualified customers over a
   term of up to 39 months. The associated financing fees are paid to our
   third-party partner at the outset of the arrangement and are recorded
   as a reduction to Subscription revenue over the contract term. We
   terminated both offerings by July 2018 at which point all subsequent
   future subscriptions became month-to-month; however, we will continue
   to see an impact to subscription revenue until fiscal 2022 as the
   revenue under legacy prepaid subscriptions is earned ratably over the
   remaining service period, which extends up to 39 months from the
   initial date of subscription activation.

   Other

   Other revenue primarily consists of Peloton branded apparel.

   Cost of Revenue

   Connected Fitness Products

   Connected Fitness Product cost of revenue consists of Bike and Tread
   product costs, including manufacturing costs, duties and other
   applicable importing costs, shipping and handling costs, packaging,
   warranty replacement costs, fulfillment costs, warehousing costs, and
   certain allocated costs related to management, facilities, and
   personnel-related expenses associated with supply chain logistics. As
   we launch new Connected Fitness Products, such as the Tread, and
   continue to grow our presence in new regions where we have not yet
   achieved economies of scale, we expect to incur higher cost of revenue
   (as a percentage of sales) for our Connected Fitness Products.

   Subscription

   Subscription cost of revenue includes costs associated with content
   creation and costs to stream content to our Members. These costs
   consist of both fixed costs, including studio rent and occupancy, other
   studio overhead, instructor and production personnel-related expenses,
   as well as variable costs, including music royalty fees, content costs
   for past use, third-party platform streaming costs and payment
   processing fees for our monthly subscription billings. While our fixed
   costs currently represent the majority of these costs, music royalty
   fees are our largest subscription variable cost. As we have grown the
   number of licensing agreements with music rights holders, music royalty
   fees as a percent of our subscription revenue has
   increased. However, unlike music streaming services where having an
   exhaustive music catalog is vital to be able to compete for customers,
   we have control over what music we select for our classes. As a result,
   we expect to be able to manage music expense such that, over time,
   these fees as a percentage of subscription revenue will flatten, or
   even decrease.

   Other

   Other cost of revenue consists primarily of apparel costs, as well as
   related warehousing and fulfillment costs.

   Operating Expenses

   Research and Development

   Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel and
   facilities-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses,
   tooling and prototype materials, and software platform expenses. We
   capitalize certain qualified costs incurred in connection with the
   development of internal-use software which may also cause research and
   development expenses to vary from period to period. We expect our
   research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in
   future periods and vary from period to period as a percentage of total
   revenue as we continue to hire personnel to develop new and enhance
   existing Connected Fitness Products and interactive software.

   Sales and Marketing

   Sales and marketing expense consists of performance marketing media
   spend, asset creation, and other brand creative, all showroom expenses
   and related lease payments, payment processing fees incurred in
   connection with the sale of our Connected Fitness Products, sales and
   marketing personnel-related expenses, and all expenses related to
   Peloton Digital. We intend to continue to invest in our sales and
   marketing capabilities in the future and expect this expense to
   increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we release new
   products and expand internationally. Sales and marketing expense as a
   percentage of total revenue may fluctuate from period to period based
   on total revenue and the timing of our investments in our sales and
   marketing functions as these investments may vary in scope and scale
   over future periods.

   General and Administrative

   General and administrative expense includes personnel-related expenses
   and facilities-related costs primarily for our executive, finance,
   accounting, legal, human resources, and IT functions. General and
   administrative expense also includes fees for professional services
   principally comprised of legal, audit, tax and accounting services, and
   insurance.

   Following the completion of this offering, we expect to incur
   additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating
   as a public company, including expenses related to compliance and
   reporting obligations of public companies,


                                     68
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   and increased costs for insurance, investor relations expenses, and
   professional services. As a result, we expect that our general and
   administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future
   periods and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue, but
   we expect to leverage these expenses over time as we grow our revenue
   and Connected Fitness Subscriber base.

   Other (Expense) Income, Net

   Other (expense) income, net consists of interest (expense) income
   associated with our debt financing arrangements, amortization of debt
   issuance costs and interest income earned on investments.

   Provision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes

   The provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of
   income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we
   conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal
   and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more
   likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized.

   Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation Expense

   Tender Offers

   In April 2017, we commenced a cash tender offer, which was completed in
   June 2017, for the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock
   and redeemable convertible preferred stock from existing stockholders,
   including current and former employees, which had a significant impact
   on our stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2017. In the 2017
   tender offer, we repurchased an aggregate of 9,661,156 shares of our
   capital stock. The purchase price per share in the tender offer was in
   excess of the fair value of our outstanding common stock at the time of
   the transaction and accordingly, upon the completion of the
   transaction, we recorded $8.3 million as stock-based compensation
   expense related to the excess of the selling price per share of common
   stock paid to our employees over the fair value of the tendered
   shares.

   In August 2018, we commenced a cash tender offer, which was completed
   in October 2018, for the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common
   stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock from existing
   stockholders, including current and former employees, which had a
   significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense for fiscal
   2019. In the 2018 tender offer, we repurchased an aggregate of
   9,264,518 shares of our capital stock. The purchase price per share in
   the tender offer was in excess of the fair value of our outstanding
   common stock at the time of the transaction and accordingly, upon the
   completion of the transaction, we recorded $28.2 million as stock-based
   compensation expense related to the excess of the selling price per
   share of common stock paid to our employees over the fair value of the
   tendered shares.

   Additionally, for shares held less than six months and thus deemed to
   not be subject to market risks, we recorded a liability for the maximum
   number of shares that were eligible for the tender offer when it became
   probable that the event allowing for the redemption would occur. To the
   extent that this liability exceeded amounts previously recognized in
   equity, the excess was recognized as compensation cost. As a result of
   this liability, we recognized an additional stock-compensation expense
   of $33.5 million. See Note 12 of the notes to our audited consolidated
   financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for
   additional information.

   material in our content in exchange for a mutually-agreed payment. We
   refer to these payments as content costs for past use.

   2018 Compared to 2019

   Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 increased
   $215.8 million, or 110.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was
   primarily driven by costs associated with the growth in the number of
   Connected Fitness Products delivered during the period.

   Our Connected Fitness Products gross margin decreased slightly due to
   the increasing mix of deliveries of Tread, partially offset by cost
   efficiencies achieved in the manufacturing of our Bike.

   Subscription cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $58.2 million,
   or 127.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily driven
   by an increase of $23.1 million in music royalty and streaming delivery
   fees driven by increased usage of our platform, an increase of
   $14.0 million in personnel-related expenses due to our introduction of
   the Tread and other new fitness and wellness verticals such as yoga and
   meditation, and expansion into the United Kingdom, an increase of
   $8.5 million in depreciation and amortization expense driven by our
   acquired developed technology, and an increase of $4.6 million in
   occupancy costs associated with lease commencement for our two new
   production studios in New York City and London.

   Subscription gross margin decreased by 53 basis points from fiscal 2018
   to fiscal 2019 as we invested in new initiatives discussed above,
   partially offset by leveraging the fixed costs of content production as
   we scaled our Connected Fitness Subscriber base. Included in
   subscription cost of revenue are content costs for past use of $14.5
   million and $16.4 million for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively. These
   costs had a negative basis point impact on subscription gross margin of
   1,805 and 908 for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively.

   Other cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $12.1 million, or
   247.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily
   attributable to the growth of our branded apparel sales during the
   period as well as an increase in our apparel inventory reserves.

   Other gross margin decreased during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
   due to an increase in our apparel inventory reserves.

   2017 Compared to 2018

   Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 increased
   $81.5 million, or 71.7%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was
   primarily driven by the growth in the number of Connected Fitness
   Products delivered during the period. We gained significant
   efficiencies in manufacturing costs resulting in a 592 basis point
   improvement in Connected Fitness Product gross margin from fiscal 2017
   to fiscal 2018.

   Subscription cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $16.2 million,
   or 55.4%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily driven
   by a $10.9 million increase in music royalty and streaming delivery
   fees, a $2.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses as we
   continued to grow our content offering for the Tread, and a $1.6
   million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. We also
   incurred an additional $1.3 million in production studio occupancy
   costs primarily attributable to the opening of a second production
   studio in June 2017 to support Tread content creation.

   Subscription gross margin significantly improved by 3,356 basis points
   from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. This was primarily driven by the
   impact of content costs for past use of $15.5 million and $14.5 million
   for fiscal 2017 and 2018, respectively, which more adversely impacted
   gross margin for fiscal 2017 given the lower Connected Fitness
   Subscriber base. These content costs for past use had a negative basis
   point impact on subscription gross margin of 4,788 and 1,805 for fiscal
   2017 and 2018, respectively. We drove further margin improvements by
   leveraging fixed costs of content production while scaling our
   Connected Fitness Subscriber base in fiscal 2018.

   Other cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $3.0 million, or
   163.3%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily
   attributable to the growth of our branded apparel sales.

   2018 Compared to 2019

   Research and development expense for fiscal 2019 increased
   $31.5 million, or 134.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was
   due primarily to an increase in personnel-related expenses, which,
   excluding stock-based compensation expense, increased $16.8 million,
   due to increased headcount. Stock-based compensation expense increased
   $6.3 million, of which $3.8 million was related to incremental costs
   associated with the tender offer completed in October 2018.

   2017 Compared to 2018

   Research and development expenses for fiscal 2018 increased
   $10.3 million, or 79.1%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was due
   primarily to increases of $3.9 million in product development and
   research costs, $3.3 million in personnel-related expenses, excluding
   stock-based compensation expense, resulting from increased headcount,
   and $1.1 million in web hosting fees to create new, as well as improve
   existing products and interactive software features on our platform.

   2018 Compared to 2019

   Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2019 increased $172.6 million,
   or 114.1%, compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was due primarily to
   increased spending of $117.4 million on advertising and marketing
   programs. In addition, personnel-related expenses, excluding
   stock-based compensation expense, increased by $22.2 million due to
   increased headcount, expenses related to our showrooms and microstores
   increased by $15.3 million due to our addition of 39 global retail
   locations, and stock-based compensation expense increased $7.7 million,
   of which $6.2 million was related to incremental costs associated with

   2017 Compared to 2018

   Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2018 increased $65.4 million, or

   $44.3 million in increased marketing costs, $8.2 million of increased
   personnel-related expenses, $5.4 million of increased payment
   processing fees, and $5.2 million of additional costs related to 12
   additional retail locations we added in the period.

   General and administrative expense for fiscal 2019 increased
   $144.6 million, or 231.5%, compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was
   due primarily to an increase of $64.1 million in stock-based
   compensation expense, of which $50.6 million related to the tender
   offer completed in October 2018. Professional fees, comprised of legal,
   accounting, and consulting fees, increased by $24.4 million. In
   addition, personnel-related expenses, excluding stock-based
   compensation expense, increased by $22.7 million due to increased
   headcount. We also incurred an additional $8.4 million expense relating
   to new system implementations and software licenses to support our
   growth and scale our operations, and facilities costs increased
   $12.9 million, of which $7.2 million was lease expense related to
   build-to-suit obligations.

   2017 Compared to 2018

   General and administrative expense for fiscal 2018 increased
   $16.8 million, or 36.8%, compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was
   primarily due to an additional $6.5 million in professional services
   fees, $6.4 million in personnel-related expenses, excluding stock-based
   compensation expense, due to increased headcount, $2.5 million in new
   system implementations and licenses to support our growth and scale our
   operations, and $2.3 million of facilities costs from additional leased
   office space. These costs were partially offset by a decrease of
   $3.0 million in stock-based compensation expense due to an incremental
   $8.3 million charge incurred in fiscal 2017 related to the tender offer
   completed in June 2017.

   Other (expense) income, net, was $6.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared
   to $(0.3) million for fiscal 2018. The increase in other (expense)
   income, net, was primarily due to $8.2 million of interest earned on
   cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, partially offset by
   a $1.0 million increase in interest expense incurred under our Credit
   Agreement.

   2017 Compared to 2018

   Other (expense) income, net, for fiscal 2018 was $(0.3) million

   in interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
   was partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in interest expense
   incurred under our Credit Agreement and the associated amortization of
   deferred financing costs.

   Quarterly Trends

   Revenue

   Our revenue from our Connected Fitness Products typically varies
   seasonally and we have historically experienced higher levels of
   Connected Fitness Products revenue in the second and third quarters of
   each fiscal year as compared to other quarters due in large part to
   seasonal holiday demand, New Years resolutions, and cold weather.

   Subscription revenue increased in each of the quarters presented
   primarily due to Connected Fitness Subscriber growth and low Average
   Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn.

   Cost of Revenue

   Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue has fluctuated in line with
   Connected Fitness Products revenue for all periods presented due
   primarily to costs associated with sales of Connected Fitness Products.

   Our subscription cost of revenue generally increased each quarter as a
   result of increases in music royalties, streaming, and platform costs,
   as well as payment processing fees. We saw fluctuations in the third
   quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due to content costs for past
   use.

   Operating Expenses

   Research and development expense increased for all periods presented,
   primarily due to personnel-related expenses as we have continued to
   increase our headcount to support product and platform innovation.

Table of Contents

   Sales and marketing expense increased in the second and third quarter
   of each fiscal year due to an increase in expenses associated with
   advertising costs and other marketing programs for the holiday season.
   In addition, sales and marketing expenses increased as a result of
   higher personnel-related expenses and occupancy costs as we increased
   headcount and number of showrooms to support our growth.

   General and administrative expense generally increased for all periods
   presented, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses,
   facilities costs, and professional service fees as we grow our business
   and scale operations. We saw a significant increase in general and
   administrative expenses in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019
   related to stock-based compensation expense associated with the tender
   offer completed in October 2018.

   Starting in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we began to incur
   significant costs related to certain growth initiatives including the
   introduction of our Tread, international expansion, and content
   investments which had an adverse impact on our Adjusted EBITDA. To
   support our growth, we have also begun to make investments in supply
   chain, product development, and a new headquarters in New York City
   which we expect will continue to impact our Adjusted EBITDA Margin.
   Adjusted EBITDA was also more adversely impacted in certain quarters
   presented due to the variable nature of our content costs for past use.
   See the section titled Content Costs for Past Use for additional
   information.

                               32.7 %      60.0 %

































   Our Subscription Contribution Margin has fluctuated over time due, in
   part, to the variable nature of our content costs for past use. See the
   section titled Content Costs for Past Use. Excluding content costs
   for past use, Subscription Contribution increased in each of the
   quarters presented primarily due to the growth of our Connected Fitness
   Subscriber base and our continued low Average Net Monthly Connected
   Fitness Churn. Excluding content costs for past use, Subscription
   Contribution Margin increased quarterly through September 30, 2018 as
   we continued to leverage our fixed content costs across our growing
   Connected Fitness Subscriber base. In the subsequent quarters we began
   to make significant investments in Tread content, including the leasing
   of a Tread studio, as well as expansion into new content verticals such
   as yoga and meditation. Starting in the quarter ended December 31,
   2018, our Subscription Contribution costs also include rent expense for
   our new production studio in New York City, which caused our
   Subscription Contribution Margin to decline. Starting in the quarter
   ended March 31, 2019, our Subscription Contribution costs also include
   rent expense for our new London studio. In the quarter ended June 30,
   2019, Subscription Contribution Margin increased and we expect to
   continue to leverage the largely fixed costs of our studio production
   as we scale our Connected Fitness Subscriber base.

   Content Costs for Past Use

   Included within Adjusted EBITDA and Subscription Contribution are
   content costs for past use as follows:

   From time-to-time, we execute music royalty agreements with various
   music rights holders. As part of these go-forward license agreements,
   we may also enter into agreements whereby we are released from all
   potential licensor claims regarding our alleged past use of copyrighted
   material in our content in exchange for a mutually-agreed payment. We
   refer to these payments as content costs for past use. These costs can
   vary considerably from quarter to quarter since they represent our
   estimates of potential future release payments based upon license
   agreements previously entered into and the market share and size of the
   music rights holder. These estimates are subject to a variety of
   complex and evolving legal issues across many jurisdictions and are not
   predictable, which can result in fluctuation over time.

   To date, we have entered into numerous agreements with major record
   labels and major publishers, independent labels and publishers, and
   major performing rights organizations to resolve instances of alleged
   past use while entering into go-forward license agreements with each of
   these parties. We have also improved upon a music content management
   and reporting system that allows our instructors to create class
   playlists from a selection of songs licensed to us. Based on these
   efforts, we believe that payments for content costs for past use will
   decrease over time and eventually be eliminated.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources

   Our operations have been financed primarily through cash flow from
   operating activities, net proceeds from the sale of redeemable
   convertible preferred stock and borrowings under our Credit Agreement.
   As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $162.1 million
   and marketable securities of $216.0 million.

   We believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flow
   from operations, marketable securities portfolio, and amounts available
   for borrowing under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our
   working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12
   months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those
   currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate
   of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and
   development efforts and other growth initiatives, the expansion of
   sales and marketing activities, the timing of new Connected Fitness
   Product introductions, market acceptance of our Connected Fitness
   Products, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current
   and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund
   our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to
   seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity
   would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence
   of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the
   instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and
   financing covenants that would restrict our operations. There can be no
   assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. The
   inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to
   achieve our business objectives.

   Amended and Restated Credit Agreement

   In June 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase
   Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, lead arranger and bookrunner and
   Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending
   Partners LLC, and Silicon Valley Bank, as joint syndication agents,
   which amended and restated the loan and security agreement we
   previously entered into in November 2017. The Credit Agreement provides
   for a $250.0 million secured revolving credit facility, including up to
   the lesser of $150.0 million and the aggregate unused amount of the
   facility for the issuance of letters of credit. Interest on the Credit
   Agreement is paid based on LIBOR plus 2.75% or an Alternative Base Rate
   plus 1.75%. We are required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.375%
   on a quarterly basis based on the unused portion of the revolving
   credit facility. The principal amount, if any, is payable in full in
   June 2024. As of June 30, 2019, we had not drawn on the credit facility
   and did not have outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

   We have the option to repay our borrowings under the Credit Agreement
   without premium or penalty prior to maturity. The Credit Agreement
   contains customary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement
   reporting requirements and delivery of borrowing base certificates, as
   well as customary covenants that restrict our ability to, among other
   things, incur additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, guarantee
   obligations of third parties, declare dividends or make certain
   distributions, and undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other
   transactions. The Credit Agreement also contains certain financial
   condition covenants, including maintaining a total level of liquidity
   of not less than $125.0 million and


                                     81

   maintaining certain minimum total revenue ranging from $725 million to
   $1,985 million depending on the applicable date of determination. As of
   June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants under the
   Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2019, we had outstanding letters of
   credit totaling $40.1 million issued primarily to cover security
   deposits for our operating lease and inventory purchase obligations.

   Operating Activities

   Net cash used in operating activities of $(108.6) million for fiscal
   2019 was primarily due to a net loss of $195.6 million and a decrease
   in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $22.9 million,
   partially offset by non-cash adjustments of $109.8 million. The
   decrease in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to
   an $111.3 million increase in inventory levels as a result of our
   introduction of the Peloton Tread, as well as our expansion into the
   United Kingdom and Canada, and a $30.3 million increase in prepaid
   expenses and other current assets driven by general growth; partially
   offset by an $117.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued
   expenses related to increased expenditures to support general business
   growth. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based
   compensation expense of $89.5 million of which $61.7 million related to
   a tender offer completed in October 2018.

   Net cash provided by operating activities of $49.7 million for fiscal
   2018 was primarily due to an increase in net change in operating assets
   and liabilities of $81.5 million and non-cash adjustments of
   $16.1 million, partially offset by a net loss of $47.9 million. The
   increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities was
   primarily due to a $63.0 million increase in deferred revenue
   associated with our prior Subscription offering launched in October
   2017 whereby customers could purchase a subscription upfront for a
   39-month term as well as overall growth in our sales of Connected
   Fitness Products, and a $41.0 million increase in accounts payable and
   accrued expenses related to growth of expenditures to support general
   business growth; partially offset by a $9.6 million increase in
   inventory levels and a $12.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and
   other current assets driven by general growth. Non-cash adjustments
   primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense and
   depreciation and amortization expense.

   Net cash used in operating activities of $18.6 million for fiscal 2017
   was primarily due to a net loss of $71.1 million, partially offset by
   an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of
   $38.2 million and non-cash adjustments of $14.3 million. The increase
   in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to
   a $22.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses
   related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth,
   and a $19.0 million increase in deferred revenue associated with
   overall growth in our sales of Connected Fitness Products. Non-cash
   adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense.

   Investing Activities

   Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 of $297.5 million was
   primarily related to the purchase of marketable securities of
   $249.8 million and capital expenditures of $83.0 million, partially
   offset by maturities of marketable securities of $36.0 million.

   Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 of $56.7 million was
   due to the cash portion of the acquisition of Neurotic Media of
   $28.7 million, net of cash acquired, and cash used of $28.0 million for
   capital expenditures. We acquired Neurotic Media primarily to automate
   and streamline content rights management and to enhance Member
   engagement through new music features. Of the total purchase
   consideration, $4.2 million has been recorded to goodwill,
   $24.8 million to acquired developed technology, and $0.1 million in
   tangible net assets.

   Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 of $10.2 million for
   capital expenditures.

   Financing Activities

   Net cash provided by financing activities of $417.2 million for fiscal
   2019 was primarily related to net proceeds from issuance of Series F
   redeemable convertible preferred stock of $408.8 million, net of
   issuance costs and repurchases of common stock and preferred stock, as
   well as $9.3 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options.

   Net cash provided by financing activities of $3.1 million for fiscal
   2018 was primarily related to proceeds from exercises of stock options
   of $7.4 million, partially offset by $4.3 million in debt repayment and
   issuance costs.

   Net cash provided by financing activities of $143.6 million for fiscal
   2017 was primarily related to net proceeds from issuance of Series E
   redeemable convertible preferred stock of $145.6 million, net of
   issuance costs and repurchases of common stock and preferred stock, as
   well as proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility of
   $10.5 million. These amounts were partially offset by the $13.0 million
   debt repayment of our term loan and revolver.

   Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

   The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of
   June 30, 2019:


                              Payments Due By Period

   (1)

   Operating lease obligations relate to our office space, warehouses,
   production studios, and retail showrooms and microstores. The lease
   terms are between one and twenty-one years, and the majority of the
   lease agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period.


   (2)

   We are subject to minimum royalty payments associated with our license
   agreements for the use of licensed content. See Risk FactorsRisks
   Related to Our BusinessWe are party to many music license agreements
   that are complex and impose numerous obligations upon us that may make
   it difficult to operate our business, and a breach of such agreements
   could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
   condition.


   (3)

   We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% based on the unused
   portion of the revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2019, we were
   contingently liable for approximately $40.1 million in standby letters
   of credit as security for our operating lease obligations.

   The commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts
   that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all
   significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used,
   fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing
   of the actions under the contracts.

   Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and
   services are not included in the table. We cannot determine the
   aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual
   obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to
   purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based
   on our current needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers and
   manufacturers within short periods of time. We subcontract with other
   companies to manufacture our products. During the normal course of
   business, we and our manufacturers procure components based upon a
   forecasted production plan. If we cancel all or part of the orders, we
   may be liable to our suppliers and manufacturers for the cost of the
   unutilized component orders or components purchased by our
   manufacturers.

   In December 2017, we entered into a 21-year operating lease agreement
   for our new fitness programming hub in New York City. This lease
   commenced in October 2018, upon the date we took possession of the
   leased space and committed to make $99.5 million in minimum fixed
   payments over the term of the lease agreement, although cash payments
   for rental obligations under the lease do not begin until October 2019.
   This lease contains a renewal option for two additional five-year
   periods and includes a tenant improvement allowance of $3.0 million.

   In November 2018, we entered into a 16-year operating lease agreement
   for space to be used as our new corporate headquarters in New York
   City. This lease is expected to commence in August 2019 when we take
   possession of the leased space and commit to pay $503.0 million in
   minimum fixed payments over the term of the lease. This lease contains
   a renewal option for an additional 10-year period and includes a tenant
   improvement allowance of $28.0 million.

   Between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020, the end of our 2020 fiscal
   year, we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $250.0
   million to $300.0 million, which will be largely attributable to the
   build out of our new headquarters in New York City, our investment in
   developing our New York and London production studios, and an increase
   in the number of showrooms that we operate.

   In June 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire a third party for
   approximately $50.0 million. The agreement is subject to standard
   closing conditions and third-party approvals. We expect to close the
   transaction in September 2019.

   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

   We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2019.

   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

   Interest Rate Risk

   We are primarily exposed to changes in short-term interest rates with
   respect to our cost of borrowing under our Credit Agreement. We monitor
   our cost of borrowing under our facility, taking into account our
   funding requirements, and our expectations for short-term rates in the
   future. A hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate on our Credit
   Agreement for all periods presented would not have a material impact on
   our financial statements.

   Foreign Currency Risk

   To date, all of our inventory purchases have been denominated in U.S.
   dollars. Our international sales are primarily denominated in foreign
   currencies and any unfavorable movement in the exchange rate between
   U.S. dollars and the currencies in which we conduct sales in foreign
   countries could have an adverse impact on our revenue. A portion of our
   operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are
   denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to
   fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In
   addition, our suppliers incur many costs, including labor and supply
   costs, in other currencies. While we are not currently contractually
   obligated to pay increased costs due to changes in exchange rates, to
   the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably for our suppliers, they
   may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a
   material impact on our gross margins. Our operating results and cash
   flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign
   currency exchange rates. However, we believe that the exposure to
   foreign currency fluctuation from operating expenses is relatively
   small at this time as the related costs do not constitute a significant
   portion of our total expenses. To date, we have not entered into
   derivatives or hedging transactions, as our exposure to foreign
   currency exchange rates has historically been partially hedged as our
   foreign currency denominated inflows have covered our foreign currency
   denominated expenses. However, we may enter into derivative or hedging
   transactions in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should
   become more significant.

   Inflation Risk

   We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our
   business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs
   become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be
   able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our
   inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial
   condition, and operating results.

   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

   Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
   operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
   have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing the
   consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and judgments that
   affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders
   equity/deficit, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We
   re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based
   on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
   believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the
   uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from
   these estimates and could differ based upon other assumptions or
   conditions. The critical accounting policies that reflect our more
   significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
   consolidated financial statements include those noted below.

   Revenue Recognition

   Our primary source of revenues are from sales of our Connected Fitness
   Products including our Bike and Tread, related accessories, and monthly
   Connected Fitness Subscriptions.


                                     84
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   We determine revenue recognition through the following steps in
   accordance with Topic 606 which we adopted as of July 1, 2018 on a full
   retrospective basis:


     

   identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;


     

   identification of the performance obligations in the contract;


     

   determination of the transaction price;


     

   allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in
   the contract; and


     

   recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance
   obligation.

   Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services
   are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the
   consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods
   or services. Our revenue is reported net of sales returns and
   discounts, which to date have not been material to our financial
   statements. We estimate our liability for product returns based on
   historical return trends by product category and seasonality and an
   evaluation of current economic and market conditions, and record the
   expected customer refund liability as a reduction to revenue, and the
   expected inventory right of recovery as a reduction of cost of revenue.
   If actual return costs differ from previous estimates, the amount of
   the liability and corresponding revenue are adjusted in the period in
   which such costs occur.

   Some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance
   obligations. For customer contracts that include multiple performance
   obligations, we account for individual performance obligations if they
   are distinct. The transaction price is then allocated to each
   performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. We
   generally determine standalone selling price based on the prices
   charged to customers.

   Deferred revenue is recorded for nonrefundable cash payments received
   for our performance obligation to transfer or stand ready to transfer,
   goods or services in the future. Deferred revenue consists of
   Subscription fees billed that have not been recognized. Customer
   deposits represent payments received in advance in instances where the
   revenue contract is cancelable in nature, and therefore, we do not have
   an unconditional obligation to transfer control to a customer.

   Product Warranty

   We offer a standard product warranty that our products will operate
   under normal, non-commercial use for a period of one-year from the date
   of original delivery. We have the obligation, at our option, to either
   repair or replace a defective product. At the time revenue is
   recognized, an estimate of future warranty costs is recorded as a
   component of cost of revenue. The estimate of future warranty costs is
   based on historical as well as current product failure rates, service
   delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures, and warranty
   policies. We regularly review these estimates to assess the
   appropriateness of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the
   amounts as necessary. Should actual product failures, use of materials
   or other costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty
   liabilities could be incurred, which could materially affect our
   results of operations. The estimates and assumptions used to reserve
   for product warranty have been accurate in all material respects and
   have not materially changed historically.

   Goodwill and Intangible Assets

   Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration
   transferred and the fair value of any non-controlling interest
   recognized, if any, over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired
   and liabilities assumed in a business combination.

   Intangible assets other than goodwill are comprised of acquired
   developed technology. At initial recognition, intangible assets
   acquired in a business combination are recognized at their fair value
   as of the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition,
   intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and
   impairment losses, if any, and are amortized on a straight-line basis
   over the estimated useful life of the asset, which was determined based
   on managements estimate of the period over which the asset will
   contribute to our future cash flows. We review goodwill for impairment
   annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
   carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In conducting our
   annual goodwill impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to
   determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the
   asset is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the
   fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we perform a
   quantitative impairment assessment of the asset, analyzing the expected
   present value of future cash flows to quantify the amount of
   impairment, if any. We perform our annual impairment tests in the
   fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We assess the impairment of
   intangible assets whenever events or changing circumstances indicate
   that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

   Music Royalty Fees

   We recognize music royalty fees on all music we stream to Members as
   these fees are incurred in accordance with the terms of the relevant
   license agreement with the music rights holder. The incurrence of the
   royalties is primarily driven by content usage by our Members on a
   fee-per-play basis through the use of our Subscriptions and classified
   within subscription cost of revenue within the our statement of
   operations. Our license agreements with music rights holders generally
   include provisions for advance royalties as well as minimum guarantees.
   When a minimum guarantee is paid in advance, the guarantee is recorded
   as a prepaid expense and amortized to subscription cost of revenue.

   As we execute music license agreements with various music rights
   holders for go-forward usage, we may also simultaneously enter into a
   settlement agreement whereby we are released from all potential
   licensor claims regarding our alleged past use of copyrighted material
   in exchange for a negotiated payment. These are referred to as content
   costs for past use and are recorded within subscription cost of
   revenue. We have entered into agreements with music rights holders who
   represent all the music catalogs that we need to operate our service,
   however, given the uncertain and opaque nature of music rights
   ownership, our archived library may continue to include music for which
   certain rights or fractional interests have not been accurately
   determined or fully licensed. Prior to the execution of a music license
   agreement, we estimate and record a charge based upon license
   agreements previously entered into and the market share and size of the
   music rights holder.

   Stock-Based Compensation

   Stock-based awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair
   value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of actual
   forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
   period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.
   For performance-based stock options issued, the value of the instrument
   is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the award and
   expensed over the vesting term when the performance targets are
   considered probable of being achieved.

   We calculate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using
   the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of the grant
   date fair value of stock option awards issued is affected by a number
   of variables, including the fair value of our underlying common stock,
   our expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option
   award, the expected term of the award, risk-free interest rates, and
   the expected dividend yield of our common stock.

   Generally, our stock option awards permit early exercise. The unvested
   portion of shares exercised is recorded as a liability on our balance
   sheet and reclassified to equity as vesting occurs.

   The estimated grant-date fair value of our equity-based awards issued
   to service providers was calculated using the Black-Scholes
   option-pricing model, based on the following assumptions:


                            Fiscal Year Ended June 30,
                              2017                      2018

                    Weighted-average expected volatility
                         79.3%        55.2%        45.0%

   Dividend Yield. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have never
   declared or paid cash dividends and have no current plans to do so in
   the foreseeable future.

   Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our
   stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We do not have
   sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon
   which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time
   stock-based awards have been exercisable. As a result, for stock
   options, we used the simplified method to calculate the expected term
   estimate based on the vesting and contractual terms of the option.
   Under the simplified method, the expected term is equal to the average
   of the stock-based awards weighted-average vesting period and its
   contractual term. For awards granted which contain performance
   conditions, we estimate the expected term based on the estimated dates
   that the performance conditions will be satisfied.


                                     86

   Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the
   U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for
   zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to
   the stock options expected term.

   Expected Volatility. Since we do not have a trading history of our
   common stock, the expected volatility was derived from the average
   historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies
   within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business
   over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards, We intend
   to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or
   similar companies to estimate the expected volatility until sufficient
   historical information regarding the volatility of the share price of
   our Class A common stock becomes available.

   We also grant stock-based awards to non-employees. We believe that for
   stock options issued to non-employees, the fair value of the stock
   option is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the services
   rendered. Therefore, we estimate the fair value of non-employee stock
   options using a Black-Scholes valuation model with appropriate
   assumptions.

   Common Stock Valuations

   In the absence of a public trading market, the fair value of our common
   stock was determined by our board of directors, with input from
   management, taking into account our most recent valuations from an
   independent third-party valuation specialist. Our board of directors
   intended all stock options granted to have an exercise price per share
   not less than the per share fair value of our common stock on the date
   of grant. The valuations of our common stock were determined in
   accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of
   Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of
   Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The
   assumptions we use in the valuation models were based on future
   expectations combined with management judgment, and considered numerous
   objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our
   common stock as of the date of each option grant, including the
   following factors:


     

   relevant precedent transactions involving our capital stock;


     

   contemporaneous valuations performed at periodic intervals by unrelated
   third-party specialists;


     

   the liquidation preferences, rights, preferences, and privileges of our
   redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to the common stock;


     

   our actual operating and financial performance;


     

   current business conditions and projections;


     

   our stage of development;


     

   the likelihood and timing of achieving a liquidity event for the shares
   of common stock underlying the stock options, such as an initial public
   offering, given prevailing market conditions;


     

   any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability of the
   common stock underlying the granted options;


     

   recent secondary stock sales and tender offers;


     

   the market performance of comparable publicly-traded companies; and


     

   the U.S. and global capital market conditions.

   In valuing our common stock at various dates in fiscal 2017, 2018, and
   2019, our board of directors determined the equity value of our
   business using various valuation methods including combinations of
   income and market approaches with input from management. The income
   approach estimates the fair value based on the expectation of future
   cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are
   discounted to their present values using an appropriate discount rate
   to reflect the risks inherent in us achieving these estimated cash
   flows. The market approach estimates value considering an analysis of
   guideline public companies. The guideline public companies method
   estimates value by applying a representative revenue multiple from a
   peer group of companies in similar lines of business to our forecasted
   revenue. Our peer group of companies was selected based on operational
   and economic similarities to us and factors considered included but
   were not limited to industry, business model, growth rates, customer
   base, capitalization, size, profitability and stage of development.
   From time to time, we updated the set of comparable companies as new or
   more relevant information became available. This approach involves the
   identification of relevant transactions, and determining relevant
   multiples to apply to our revenue.

   The equity values implied by the income and market approaches
   reasonably approximated each other as of each valuation date.


                                     87
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   Once we determined an equity value, we used a combination of approaches
   to allocate the equity value to each class of our stock. We used the
   option pricing method, or OPM. The OPM allocates values to each equity
   class by creating a series of call options on our equity value, with
   exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences, participation
   rights, and exercise prices of the equity instruments.

   We also considered an appropriate discount adjustment to recognize the
   lack of marketability and liquidity due to the fact that stockholders
   of private companies do not have access to trading markets similar to
   those enjoyed by stockholders of public companies. The discount for
   marketability was determined using a protective put option model, in
   which a put option is used as a proxy for measuring discounts for lack
   of marketability of securities.

   Following August 2018, the resulting equity value was then allocated to
   the common stock using a probability weighted expected return method,
   or PWERM. Under PWERM, we estimated the value of our common stock based
   upon an analysis of our values assuming an initial public offering as a
   possible future event. Additionally, the OPM, using the preferred
   stockholders liquidation preferences, participation rights, dividend
   rights, and conversion rights to determine the value of each share
   class in specific potential future outcomes, was considered in the
   PWERM approach. We also applied a discount for lack of marketability to
   account for a lack of access to an active public market.

   In addition, we also considered any private or secondary transactions
   involving our capital stock as well as tender offers completed in
   fiscal 2017 and 2019. In our evaluation of those transactions, we
   considered the facts and circumstances of each transaction to determine
   the extent to which they represented a fair value exchange. Factors
   considered include transaction volume, timing, whether the transactions
   occurred among willing and unrelated parties, and whether the
   transactions involved investors with access to our financial
   information.

   Application of these approaches involves the use of estimates,
   judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such
   as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, and future
   cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of
   comparable companies, and the probability of possible future events.
   Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the
   relationships between those assumptions impact our valuations as of
   each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of
   our common stock.

   For valuations after the completion of this offering, our board of
   directors will determine the fair value of each share of underlying
   Class A common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as
   reported on the date of grant. Future expense amounts for any
   particular period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or
   market conditions.

   Based upon the assumed initial public offering price of $        per
   share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of
   this prospectus, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options
   outstanding as of June 30, 2019 was $        million, of which
   $        million related to vested stock options and $        million
   related to unvested stock options. In addition, we granted options to
   purchase 664,050 shares of our Class B common stock subsequent to
   June 30, 2019.

   Income Taxes

   We utilize the asset and liability method for computing our income tax
   provision. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the expected
   future consequences of temporary differences between the financial
   reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating
   loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax
   rates. Management makes estimates, assumptions, and judgments to
   determine our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and
   liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax
   assets. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be
   recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that
   recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.

   We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it
   is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on
   examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of
   the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then
   measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
   likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties
   related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been
   material, are recognized within provision for income taxes.

   Loss Contingencies

   We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax, and
   government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary

   substantial or indeterminate amounts of

   damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable
   that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably
   estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the
   loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the
   possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial
   statements. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible but the
   loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we state that
   such an estimate cannot be made.

   We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the
   amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the
   matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make
   adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures
   accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,
   rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant
   judgment is required to determine both the probability and the
   estimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based on our
   assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date
   and are subject to change based on new information and future events.

   The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or
   more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of
   managements expectations, our results of operations and financial
   condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such
   outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely
   affected.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements

   See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to
   our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
   prospectus for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently
   issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the dates of the
   statement of financial position included in this prospectus.

   Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

   In the course of preparing the financial statements that are included
   in this prospectus, our management has determined that we have material
   weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These
   material weaknesses primarily pertained to IT general controls,
   controls to address segregation of certain accounting duties, timely
   reconciliation and analysis of certain key accounts and the review of
   journal entries. We have concluded that these material weaknesses in
   our internal control over financial reporting occurred because, prior
   to this offering, we were a private company and did not have the
   necessary business processes, systems, personnel and related internal
   controls necessary to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting
   requirements of a public company.

   In order to remediate these material weaknesses, we have taken and plan
   to take the following actions:


     

   implementation of IT general controls to manage access and program
   changes within our IT environment;


     

   the hiring and continued hiring of additional accounting and finance
   resources with public company experience;


     

   implementation of additional review controls and processes and
   requiring timely account reconciliations and analyses; and


     

   implementation of processes and controls to better identify and manage
   segregation of duties risks.

   In accordance with the provisions of the JOBS Act, we and our
   independent registered public accounting firm were not required to, and
   did not, perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial
   reporting as of June 30, 2019 nor any period subsequent in accordance
   with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accordingly, we cannot
   assure you that we have identified all, or that we will not in the
   future have additional, material weaknesses. Material weaknesses may
   still exist when we report on the effectiveness of our internal control
   over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the
   Sarbanes-Oxley Act after the completion of this offering.

       LETTER FROM JOHN FOLEY, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

   Dear Prospective Investors and Peloton Members,

   At Peloton, we believe that better is in all of us.

   It is no secret that exercise makes us feel good. Its simple science:
   exercising creates endorphins and endorphins make us happy. On the most
   basic level, Peloton sells happiness. But of course, we do so much
   more. Our connected fitness experiences make it easy for our Members to
   get engaging, social, and highly effective workouts with world-class
   instructors anytime, anywhere. As a result, our Members work out 80%
   more than non-Peloton Members.^(1) And while the health benefits of
   regular physical fitness are well documented, the Peloton experience
   transcends health benefits alone. The happiness our Members experience
   enables each individual to be a better version of themselves, so they
   go on to inspire others. And that leads us to Pelotons mission: to
   better ourselves, inspire each other, and unite the world through
   fitness.

   I founded Peloton in 2012 to solve a challenge in my own life. My wife,
   Jill, and I knew great fitness experiences made us feel like better
   versions of ourselves, but there were countless barriers to working out
   regularly. We loved going to boutique studio fitness classes like
   cycling, running, boot camp, and yoga. We were addicted to the
   fast-paced energy, the motivational instructors, the thoughtful
   programming, and the way exercising with a group pushed us harder.
   These classes left us feeling energized, refreshed, stronger, and ready
   to take on anything. However, with demanding jobs and two small
   children at home, just getting to the gym became harder and harder.
   Classes with our favorite instructors sold out quickly and were
   prohibitively expensive. We also had to accommodate someone elses
   schedule at someone elses location. And we were often left without
   time, without options, and without the feeling of being our better
   selves that we sought.

   I figured that there must be a way to make these workouts more
   convenient, more affordable, and more accessible. There had to be a way
   to bring fantastic, high-energy, instructor-led group fitness into the
   home, to be experienced on my time, any time I wanted. And my hunch was
   that if I could make it possible, others would want it as well.

   With that spark of an idea, I looked for brilliant, creative,
   empathetic, high-integrity partners who shared my ambition and werent
   afraid to tackle complicated business and technology challenges. I was
   lucky to have several friends who fit the bill in spades: Hisao Kushi,
   Tom Cortese, Graham Stanton, and Yony Feng. All of my co-founders are
   still thriving at Peloton, each in a senior role and each an even
   stronger friend.

   To create Peloton, we needed to build what we believed to be the best
   indoor bike on the market, recruit the best instructors in the world,
   and engineer a state-of-the-art software platform to tie it all
   together. Against prevailing conventional wisdom, and despite countless
   investor conference rooms full of very smart skeptics, we were
   determined for Peloton to build a vertically integrated platform to
   deliver a seamless end-to-end experience as physically rewarding and
   addictive as attending a live, in-studio class. In Pelotons infancy,
   our lean founding team operated from a one-room headquarters with
   heavy black curtains that cordoned off a makeshift cycling studio,
   equipped with a modest six bikes and a used camcorder. We
   problem-solved our way from streaming live cycling classes to one
   hundred Members, then to one thousand, and now to over a million
   Members worldwide. It took a proverbial village to build Peloton, and
   that once-small village has grown into the community that is now the
   heart of our brand.

   From the very beginning, we have always put our Members first in
   everything we do, and they never cease to amaze us. Through connecting
   on the Peloton Bike, Tread, and Digital App, our Members have created
   one of the most supportive, optimistic, diverse, and inclusive
   communities in the world. Peloton Members are teachers, professional
   athletes, active military and veterans, healthcare providers,
   firefighters, policemen, famous actors and musicians, and even former
   Presidents. They are teenagers and senior citizens. From diverse life
   experiences, all gender identities and sexual orientations, countless
   nationalities and ethnicities. We are proud of our community of Members
   but even prouder of the way that they have united together in support
   of each other.

   Every day, I receive personal emails from our Members. The most
   consistent message I receive: Peloton has changed my life.
   Astonishingly, four out of five Members were not in the market for
   fitness equipment before they bought the Bike. They were in the market
   for improving their lives, just as Jill and I were back in 2012 when we
   started this company and began this journey.

   Seven years later, it is very clear to me that we have an immense
   opportunity in front of us at Peloton. Peloton is so much more than a
   Bike  we believe we have the opportunity to create one of the most
   innovative global technology platforms of our time. It is an
   opportunity to create one of the most important and influential
   interactive media companies in the world; a media company that changes
   lives, inspires greatness, and unites people. And it is an opportunity
   to create one of the best places to work in the cities where we operate
    we prioritize culture as much as any other business objective.

   And to be sure, we are not taking these opportunities lightly. William
   Lynch, our President; Jill Woodworth, our Chief Financial Officer;
   Kevin Cornils, our Managing Director of International; my co-founders;
   and our extended senior leadership team: all of us feel an immense
   responsibility to deliver on these opportunities, and we are ready. We
   have worked our entire careers for this very moment.

   Speaking for the entire Peloton team, we are incredibly grateful for
   all of our Members from all different backgrounds who love Peloton and
   have welcomed us into their lives over the past several years. We are
   truly humbled by your passion for our shared mission.

   Today, however, we look forward. At this important moment in our
   journey, I am honored to invite you to join Peloton.

   With gratitude,

   John Foley

   Founder and CEO

                                  BUSINESS

   Our Purpose

   We believe physical activity is fundamental to a healthy and happy
   life. Our ambition is to empower people to improve their lives through
   fitness.

   We are a technology company that meshes the physical and digital worlds
   to create a completely new, immersive, and connected fitness
   experience. We are also:

   a media company that creates engaging-to-the-point-of-addictive
   original programming with the best instructors in the world.

   an interactive software company that motivates our Members to achieve
   their goals.

   a product design company that develops beautiful and intuitive
   equipment that anticipates the needs of our Members.

   a social connection company that enables our community to support one
   another.

   a direct-to-consumer, multi-channel retail company that facilitates a
   seamless customer journey.

   an apparel company that allows Members to display their passion for
   Peloton.

   a logistics company that provides high-touch delivery, set up, and
   service for our Members.

   We are driven by our Members-first obsession and we will be any company
   we need to be in order to deliver the best fitness experience possible.

   Who We Are

   Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a
   loyal community of over 1.4 million Members. We pioneered connected,
   technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive,
   instructor-led boutique classes to our Members anytime, anywhere. We
   make fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient,
   while fostering social connections that encourage our Members to be the
   best versions of themselves.

   We are an innovation company at the nexus of fitness, technology, and
   media. We have disrupted the fitness industry by developing a
   first-of-its-kind subscription platform that seamlessly combines the
   best equipment, proprietary networked software, and world-class
   streaming digital fitness and wellness content, creating a product that
   our Members love. Our highly compelling offering helped our Members
   complete over 58 million Peloton workouts in fiscal 2019.

   Driven by our Members-first mindset, we built a vertically integrated
   platform that ensures a best-in-class, end-to-end experience. We have a
   direct-to-consumer multi-channel sales platform, including 74 showrooms
   with knowledgeable sales specialists, a high-touch delivery service,
   and helpful Member support teams. Our Members are as devoted to us as
   we are to them92% of our Connected Fitness Products ever sold still
   had an active Connected Fitness Subscription attached as of June 30,
   2019.

   Our Connected Fitness Product offerings currently include the Peloton
   Bike, launched in 2014, and the Peloton Tread, launched in 2018. Both
   our Bike and Tread include a state-of-the-art touchscreen that streams
   live and on-demand classes. Our products have a multitude of
   interactive software features that encourage frequent use, facilitate
   healthy competition on our patented leaderboard, build community among
   our Members, and inspire our Members to track performance and achieve
   their goals with real-time and historical metrics. As of June 30, 2019,
   we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products, with
   approximately 564,000 sold in the United States.

   Our world-class instructors teach classes across a variety of fitness
   and wellness disciplines, including indoor cycling, indoor/outdoor
   running and walking, bootcamp, yoga, strength training, stretching, and
   meditation. We produce over 950


                                     92
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   original programs per month and maintain a vast and constantly updated
   library of thousands of original fitness and wellness programs. We make
   it easy for Members to find a class that fits their interests based on
   class type, instructor, music genre, length, available equipment, area
   of physical focus, and level of difficulty.

   Our content is available on our Connected Fitness Products through a
   $39.00 monthly Connected Fitness Subscription, which allows for
   unlimited workouts across multiple users within a household. Our
   Connected Fitness Subscribers can enjoy our classes anywhere through
   Peloton Digital, which is available through iOS and Android mobile
   devices, as well as most tablets and computers. We also have Digital
   Subscribers who pay $19.49 per month for access our content library on
   their own devices.

   Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our Connected
   Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue. We have
   experienced significant growth in sales of Connected Fitness Products,
   which, when combined with our strong Connected Fitness Subscriber
   retention rates, has driven high growth in Connected Fitness
   Subscribers. Our Connected Fitness Subscriber base grew by 108% in
   fiscal 2019.

   Our compelling financial profile is characterized by high growth,
   strong retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient
   customer acquisition. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness
   Churn, together with our high Subscription Contribution Margin,
   generates attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. When
   we acquire new Connected Fitness Subscribers, we are able to offset our
   customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our
   Connected Fitness Products. This allows for rapid payback of our sales
   and marketing investments and results in a robust unit economic model.

   We are a fast-growing and scaled fitness platform. For fiscal 2017,
   2018, and 2019:


     

   we generated total revenue of $218.6 million, $435.0 million, and
   $915.0 million, respectively, representing 99.0% and 110.3%
   year-over-year growth;


     

   we incurred net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and
   $(195.6) million, respectively; and


     

   our Adjusted EBITDA was $(51.8) million, $(30.4) million, and $(71.3)
   million, respectively.

   See the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and
   Other DataNon-GAAP Financial Measures for information regarding our
   use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted
   EBITDA.

   For fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, key metrics of our business included:


     

   Connected Fitness Subscribers of 107,708, 245,667, and 511,202,
   respectively; and


     

   Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn of 0.70%, 0.64%, and 0.65%,
   respectively.

                           Historical Performance

   Our Industry and Opportunity

   Industry

   We participate in the massive and growing global health and wellness
   industry. According to a 2018 report by the Global Wellness Institute,
   the total global spend on the wellness industry in 2017 was $4.2
   trillion, of which the global spend on fitness and certain categories
   of wellness, including meditation and yoga, represented nearly
   $600 billion. According to the International Health, Racquet &
   Sportsclub Association, or IHRSA, 183 million and 62 million people had
   gym memberships globally and in the United States, respectively, as of
   2018.

   Our current product portfolio, which consists of our Bike, Tread, and
   fitness and wellness subscription services, addresses a large consumer
   base. Within our current and announced markets (the United States, the
   United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany), we estimate that 75 million
   people used treadmills and 27 million used stationary cycling bikes in
   the 12 months ended March 2019. In those same regions, we estimate that
   over 5 million treadmills and nearly 3 million stationary cycling bikes
   were purchased for in-home use in the 12 months ended March 2019. We
   believe that we are significantly expanding the market for fitness
   equipment and products. According to our 2019 Member Survey, four out
   of five Members were not in the market for home fitness equipment prior
   to purchasing a Peloton Connected Fitness Product.

   Opportunity

   We consider our market opportunity in terms of a Total Addressable
   Market, or TAM, which we believe is the market we can reach over the
   long-term in our current and announced markets, and a Serviceable
   Addressable Market, or SAM, which we address with our current product
   verticals and price points.

   According to our research, our TAM is 67 million households, of which
   45 million are in the United States. Within our TAM, we estimate that
   52 million households are interested in learning more about our
   Connected Fitness Products without seeing the price. We estimate that
   our SAM is 14 million Connected Fitness Products, with 12 million
   represented in the United States. Historically, our SAM has grown as
   our brand awareness has increased. With low brand awareness in our
   current international markets, we believe we will see SAM expand as we
   make further investments in building brand and product awareness in
   these regions. We will grow both TAM and SAM as we expand beyond our
   current geographies and grow SAM as we develop new Connected Fitness
   Products and content in new fitness verticals. With approximately
   577,000 Connected Fitness Products sold globally as of June 30, 2019,
   we are approximately 4% penetrated in our SAM of 14 million. For a
   discussion of the methodology used in determining our TAM and SAM, see
   the section titled Industry and Market Data.

   Consumer Trends in Our Favor

   Increasing Focus on Health and Wellness

   The growing awareness of the benefits of exercise and physical activity
   is driving increasing participation and spend in fitness and wellness.
   This has translated into consistent year-over-year growth of the
   fitness industry both in the United States and globally over the past
   two decades, even during times of economic recession. According to
   IHRSA, health club industry revenues in the United States grew at a
   5.4% annual growth rate over the last ten years. In addition, employers
   and health insurance companies are investing in employee well-being by
   offering incentives for preventative health measures such as exercise.
   According to a 2017 study by the National Business Group on Health, 74%
   of employers offer employee wellness incentives, with the average
   employee incentive amount increasing from $521 in 2013 to $742 in
   2017.    ^

   Streaming Media is the Leading Channel of Consumption

   The quality, volume, and speed of streaming content has profoundly
   changed media consumption patterns. Consumers can select from extensive
   catalogs of content across video programming, music, books, and gaming,
   among other categories, allowing for personalized, on-demand
   consumption anywhere, anytime, and at a great value. According to
   Kagan, a media research group of S&P Global Market Intelligence, global
   digital music paid subscribers are estimated to have grown from
   12.1 million in 2012 to 162.5 million in 2018. Similarly, digital video
   paid subscribers are estimated to have increased in the United States
   from 37.6 million in 2012 to 167.8 million in 2018.

   Desire for Community and Shared Experiences

   We believe consumers are increasingly spending on experiences and are
   seeking meaningful community connections. Within the fitness industry,
   consumers have migrated to boutique fitness due to personalization,
   expert instruction, and the sense of community. Boutique-style fitness
   offerings are the fastest growing brick-and-mortar fitness category.
   According to IHRSA, as of 2017, 40% of members of health and fitness
   clubs reported belonging to a boutique fitness studio, and from 2013 to
   2017, membership in boutique studios grew approximately 121%.

   Demand for Convenience

   Household trends, longer working hours, and the rise of mobile
   technology make it challenging to balance time between family, work,
   and personal health and wellness. According to the Pew Research Center,
   over the last few decades, there has been an increase in dual income
   families from 49% in 1970 to 66% in 2016. We believe that busy
   lifestyles, less free time, and changing household dynamics are driving
   demand for convenient fitness options.

   What Sets Us Apart

   Category-Defining Brand with Broad Appeal

   Peloton is the pioneer of connected, technology-enabled fitness. By
   meshing the physical and digital worlds, we have created an immersive
   experience that our Members love. We have scaled rapidly through
   data-driven marketing and


                                     95
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   education-based sales efforts. Our marketing is made more efficient by
   the significant word-of-mouth referrals from our loyal Members, which
   has become one of our largest sales channels. As a result of strong
   Connected Fitness Product sales and low Average Net Monthly Connected
   Fitness Churn, we have grown our Connected Fitness Subscribers from
   35,135 as of June 30, 2016 to 511,202 as of June 30, 2019, representing
   annualized growth of approximately 144.1%.

   We are democratizing access to high-quality boutique fitness by making
   it accessible and affordable through the compelling value of our
   unlimited household Connected Fitness Subscriptions and attractive
   financing programs for the Bike and Tread. We continue to broaden our
   demographic appealour fastest growing demographic segments are
   consumers under 35 years old and those with household incomes under
   $75,000.

   Growing and Scaled Platform with Network Effects

   As the largest interactive fitness platform in the world, our rapidly
   growing and scaled Member base is a highly strategic asset. With our
   first mover advantage, we have achieved critical mass, which improves
   our platform and Member experience. As of June 30, 2019, on average,
   nearly 6,400 Members participated in each cycling class, across live
   and on-demand. As our community of Members continues to grow, the
   Peloton fitness experience becomes more inspiring, more competitive,
   more immersive, and more connected. Over time, Members are embedded in
   the Peloton community and we become a part of their lives, increasing
   the opportunity cost of Members leaving or potential Members not
   joining our platform.

   Engaging-to-the-Point-of-Addictive Fitness Experience Drives High
   Retention

   By making fitness fun and motivating, we help our Members achieve their
   personal goals. We analyze millions of workouts per month to help us
   develop features that improve our Member experience and create new,
   on-trend fitness and wellness content that our Members crave.
   Engagement is the leading indicator of retention for our Connected
   Fitness Subscribers. We have consistently seen workouts increase over
   time. On average, our Connected Fitness Subscribers completed 7.5, 8.4,
   and 11.5 workouts per month in fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019,
   respectively. Usage drives value and loyalty, which is evidenced by our
   exceptional weighted-average 12-month Connected Fitness Subscriber
   retention rate of 95% across all fiscal year cohorts since fiscal 2016.

   Vertically Integrated Platform That is Difficult to Replicate

   We are driven by our Members-first obsession and see every Member
   touchpoint as an opportunity to exceed expectations. To create the best
   platform, we designed our own products, developed our own interactive
   software, and created our own high production value fitness and
   wellness programming. For full end-to-end Member support, we were also
   compelled to develop our own customer education, purchase and delivery,
   and services platform. We sell our Connected Fitness Products
   exclusively through our knowledgeable inside sales and showroom
   associates as well as our e-commerce site. Our high-touch delivery
   teams ensure that new Members are immediately set up and ready to work
   out on their new Bike or Tread. The effectiveness of our end-to-end
   platform is demonstrated by the high Net Promoter Score for our Bike,
   which has been within the range of 80 to 93 since we began measuring it
   in 2016.

   Compelling Financial Model

   Our financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong
   retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer
   acquisition. Our growth is attributable to our data-driven marketing
   approach and Member word-of-mouth referrals, both of which help us
   generate predictable and increasingly efficient Connected Fitness
   Product sales. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn,
   combined with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, results in
   attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. We offset
   customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our
   Connected Fitness Products, generating rapid payback of sales and
   marketing investments and robust unit economics.

   Founder-Led, Passionate Team

   Peloton was founded by John Foley in 2012. Along with his four
   co-founders, John set out to create the most convenient and immersive
   indoor cycling experience in the world. Our founders believed deeply
   that creating a Members-first experience would require Peloton to be as
   vertically integrated as possible, and so we built teams that span
   software development, product design, fitness instruction, content
   production, marketing, music, logistics, retail, and apparel. We
   believe that no other company is at the intersection of all these
   disciplines, which means that every day we are doing something that no
   other company has done before. This, along with the positive impact we
   have on our Members physical and mental well-being, fuels our passion
   for continuous innovation and progress.

   Growth Strategies

   Our goal is to rapidly grow our Member base through the sale of our
   Connected Fitness Products while continuing to engage and retain our
   scaled and loyal community of Members.

   Grow Brand Awareness

   We are still in the early stages of growth in our existing markets. As
   of June 30, 2019, we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness
   Products globally, a small fraction of the 14 million products we
   believe reflect our current SAM. While our aided brand awareness has
   grown rapidly in the United States and reached 67% as of April 3, 2019,
   we have significant room to increase our brand and product awareness in
   both the United States and in our other geographies through television,
   digital, and social media marketing, as well as our showrooms and
   word-of-mouth referrals. We continue to broaden our demographic appeal
   by educating customers on the compelling value of our Connected Fitness
   Subscriptions.

   Continuously Improve Member Experience

   We constantly improve and evolve our interactive software and content
   to drive Member engagement, which helps us maintain our high retention
   rates as we grow. We deploy new software features frequently and
   currently produce over 950 original programs per month to keep our
   content library fresh and on-trend. We also continue to drive usage
   through innovative fitness and wellness programs and goal-based
   challenges that make Members feel more accountable and help them reach
   their personal goals. Total Workouts for our Connected Fitness
   Subscribers grew from 17.9 million in fiscal 2018 to 52.2 million in
   fiscal 2019, respectively, representing a 192% increase. For a
   definition of Total Workouts, see the section titled Managements
   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
   OperationsKey Operational and Business Metrics.

   Launch New Products and Expand Content Offering

   Over time, we plan to invest heavily in new product development and
   content to further penetrate our SAM. We will launch new Connected
   Fitness Products and accessories in our existing, as well as new
   fitness verticals, while continuously updating and expanding our
   original fitness and wellness programming. We will pursue new products
   where there is a large market opportunity in areas of fitness with
   staying power.

   Pursue Disciplined Expansion into New Geographies

   With more than 174 million people belonging to gyms globally, we
   believe there is significant opportunity for Peloton to grow
   internationally. In 2018, we began our international expansion and
   brought the Peloton experience to the United Kingdom and Canada. With
   our expansion into Germany in the winter of 2019, we will be in the
   largest fitness markets in the world. We will continue to pursue
   disciplined international expansion by targeting countries with high
   fitness penetration and spend, the presence of boutique fitness, and
   where we believe the Peloton value proposition will resonate.

   Invest in Our Platform

   We will continue to invest in technology and infrastructure to extend
   our leadership in connected fitness, increase our value proposition,
   and support our growth. Over the next couple of years, we will continue
   to invest in state-of-the-art production studios in New York City and
   London and a new headquarters in New York City, which will include a
   dedicated research and development facility for new product design,
   development, and testing. We will continue to invest heavily in a
   variety of software and hardware engineering functions, supply chain
   operations, manufacturing, and advanced quality assurance to support
   our growth.

   Increase Profitability Through Fixed Cost Leverage

   The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base will
   allow us to improve Subscription Contribution Margin, increase
   Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, and generate operating
   leverage. A significant portion of our content creation costs can be
   leveraged over time given that a limited number of production studios
   and instructors can support the future growth of our Subscriber base.
   We expect to drive continued efficiencies in sales and marketing
   expenses as we benefit from increasing brand awareness, word-of-mouth
   referrals from our growing Subscriber base, and further optimization of
   our sales and marketing investments by channel. We will also achieve
   operating leverage as we scale fixed general and administrative
   expenses, including those associated with our new headquarters in New
   York City.

   2014, and the Peloton Tread, launched in 2018. Our Bike features a
   carbon steel frame, a nearly silent belt drive, magnetic resistance for
   durability, and a 22 high-definition touchscreen with built-in stereo
   speakers to stream live and on-demand classes, all in a compact, 4 by

   Tread features a shock-absorbing rubber-slat belt and ball bearing
   system, ideal for low-impact training, while pace and incline knobs
   allow for seamless adjustments. The 32 high-definition touchscreen
   features a 20-watt sound bar for an immersive experience both on and
   off the Tread. Currently our Tread is only available in the United
   States and sells for $4,295, which includes delivery and set up. We
   offer qualified customers a 24-month, 0% APR financing program,

   live and on-demand classes. Our Connected Fitness Subscription allows
   Members to access classes through our Connected Fitness Products,

   devices and most tablets and computers. Our Connected Fitness

   Peloton Digital

   Peloton Digital began as a companion app for Connected Fitness
   Subscribers to provide access to our classes while our Members were
   away from their Connected Fitness Products. Starting in June 2015, we
   offered Peloton Digital as a standalone fitness app. In June 2018, we
   relaunched Peloton Digital when we expanded our content offering to
   include bootcamp and indoor/outdoor running and walking classes. As of
   June 30, 2019, we had approximately 102,000 Peloton Digital
   Subscribers, in addition to our over 511,202 Connected Fitness
   Subscribers. A Digital Subscriber is an individual or household that
   has a paid Peloton subscription with a successful credit card billing.
   With over 67 million households in our current and announced markets
   open to subscription fitness, we believe there is ample opportunity for
   us to grow our Digital Subscription base over time.

   Today, Peloton Digital is included with all Connected Fitness
   Subscriptions. As of June 30, 2019, 50% of our Connected Fitness
   Subscribers used Peloton Digital to supplement their workout regime.
   Peloton Digital also helps us attract new Connected Fitness Subscribers
   by serving as an acquisition tool for new Members.

   Since the Peloton Digital relaunch in June 2018, we have added several
   new fitness verticals which we believe have increased the value of our
   subscription services. These include indoor/outdoor running and
   walking, bootcamp, strength training, stretching, and meditation. We
   have also significantly expanded our yoga offerings. Our Members have
   shown strong interest in these new verticals; in fiscal 2019, 35% of
   workouts completed were not indoor cycling classes.

   Our Compelling Value Proposition

   Our monthly Connected Fitness Subscription at $39.00 is less expensive
   than most monthly gym memberships, a fraction of the price of a
   personal training session, and approximately the same price as one
   boutique fitness class for one person. Boutique studio fitness classes
   typically cost between $25.00 and $45.00 per class, per person and
   follow a rigid schedule whereas our monthly Connected Fitness
   Subscription covers the household and offers unlimited use, anytime,
   anywhere. Our live class schedule and on-demand library feature classes
   spanning five to 90 minutes, providing Members with flexibility and
   convenience.

   To increase affordability, we offer attractive 0% APR financing
   programs for our Connected Fitness Products. These programs allow our
   qualified customers to pay in monthly installments of as low as $58.00
   for 39 months and $179.00 for 24 months for our Bike and Tread,
   respectively. Our financing programs have successfully broadened our
   base of Members by attracting consumers from a wider spectrum of ages
   and income levels. In fiscal 2019, approximately 50% of all Connected
   Fitness Products sold were financed.

   Existing Connected Fitness Subscribers provide a clear endorsement of
   the superior value of our offering. According to our 2019 Member
   Survey, the vast majority of our Members say that Peloton offers a
   better value than all other fitness alternatives. We strive to
   continuously improve our Member experience and value proposition
   through enhancements to our content and interactive software features.

   Our Vertically Integrated Fitness Platform

   Technology

   Our content delivery and interactive software platform are critical to
   our Member experience. We invest substantial resources in research and
   development to enhance our platform, develop new products and features,
   and improve our


                                     100

   platform infrastructure. Our research and development organization
   consists of world-class engineering, product, and design teams. Our
   teams have a diverse set of skills and industry experience, including
   expertise in highly scalable distributed systems, machine learning,
   artificial intelligence, and user-centric application engineering. Our
   engineering, product, and design teams work together to bring our
   products to life, from conception and validation to implementation. We
   constantly improve our existing Connected Fitness Products through
   frequent software updates with new and innovative interactive features.
   We are committed to leveraging data to continuously improve our Member
   experience by studying and understanding points of interaction and how
   our Members use our software features.

   Video streaming and storage are provided by third-party cloud
   providers. By leveraging these third parties, we are able to focus our
   resources on creating product enhancements and new software features.
   In addition, our technology platform is designed with redundancy and
   high availability in mind in order to minimize Member service
   disruption.

   Content and Music

   We create engaging-to-the-point-of-addictive original fitness and
   wellness content in an authentic live environment that is immersive,
   motivating, and encourages a sense of community. We combine high
   production value content with a broad catalogue of music to create a
   truly unique fitness experience our Members love.

   Content Development

   We use performance data to understand our Members workout habits in
   order to evolve and optimize our programming around class type, length,
   music, and other considerations. We have developed a diverse content
   library with thousands of classes across an extensive range of class
   lengths, difficulty levels, and fitness preferences ranging from fun
   and flexible to structured and highly technical, all of which our
   Members easily access through filtering and search capabilities. We
   produce over 950 original programs per month from three production
   studios in New York City and London, with 29 instructors as of June 30,
   2019, and across 10 fitness and wellness disciplines including indoor
   cycling, indoor/outdoor running and walking, bootcamp, yoga, strength
   training, stretching, meditation, and floor cardio. We entered into a
   long-term lease agreement at 5 Manhattan West in New York City in
   October 2018, which will serve as our fitness programming hub in North
   America and will feature four state-of-the-art production studios. We
   anticipate that this facility will open in Spring 2020.

   As we further expand internationally, we will develop localized
   content, as we have done in the United Kingdom where we produce content
   featuring three local instructors as of June 30, 2019. In December
   2018, we entered into a long-term lease agreement at 11 Floral Street
   in London, England, which will serve as our fitness programming hub in
   Europe with three state-of-the-art production studios. As we expand
   into Germany and other non-English-speaking countries, we will produce
   classes in local languages from this location and use subtitling for
   our English-speaking programming. We may selectively open small, local
   studios to supplement our international programming.

   Instructors

   In front of the camera, our 29 celebrated instructors play a critical
   role in bringing the Peloton experience to life for our Members. Our
   instructors are not only authorities in their respective areas of
   fitness, but also relatable, magnetic personalities who inspire
   passionate followings. We offer a diverse cast of instructors that
   allows us to appeal to a broad audience of Members. Our instructors
   inspire our Members both on and off the camera and attend showroom
   openings and other Member-focused events where they meet and interact
   with our Members. Our Members feel connected to our instructors, and
   many Members travel from far distances to take a class at our New York
   City studios.

   Production Team

   Behind the camera, our studio production teams are dedicated to
   creative excellence. We have top production talent representing decades
   of experience at major broadcast and cable networks, some of whom have
   won Emmy Awards for production excellence. Our teams provide dedicated
   creative support to our instructors before, during, and after live
   productions with the help of content performance data. We are focused
   on efficiency while maintaining high-quality production. All classes
   are shot in broadcast quality environments with a fraction of the staff
   and budget typical of a major network show. This allows us to deliver a
   constant stream of live-produced, authentic fitness and wellness
   programming with cinematic quality that provides clarity of instruction
   and entertainment value.



                                    LOGO

   Music and Music Technology

   We have developed a proprietary music platform that fuels the workout
   experience with thoughtfully curated playlists that align with our
   Members musical preferences. We have over a million songs under
   license, representing the largest audiovisual connected fitness music
   catalog in the world. Our curated music is as diverse and dynamic as
   the Members we serve, delivering a custom-fit-and-finish musical
   experience created by instructors and music supervisors on our
   production team.

   We control the intersection of fitness and music in a deeply engaging
   way, motivating Members to achieve their fitness goals while
   discovering great music in the process. Peloton is a discovery resource
   for new artists and songs while also providing the opportunity for our
   Members to re-discover music they love. Members consistently rank the
   music we provide as one of their favorite aspects of the Peloton
   experience. We believe we have defined a new standard for musical
   content development in the fitness and wellness categories, which
   includes premiering new music, working with artists to co-curate
   classes based on their own music or influences, and partnering to
   create new music.

   We have applied, and will continue to apply, technological solutions to
   enhance our music platform including:


     

   data-driven playlist recommendations for our instructors and music
   supervisors to use in developing class plans;


     

   instructor-facing song search and filtering functions, including the
   ability to search by song length and BPM;


     

   real-time music and content management and reporting;


     

   for Members, a display of every song played in a class, including
   artist name and associated artwork;


     

   ability for Members to like songs they discover anywhere on our
   platform and save it to their profile; and


     

   integrations with Spotify and Apple Music, enabling Members to sync
   songs they hear on Peloton to their streaming service.

   Music Rights Strategy

   We have built a world class music content management and reporting
   system to meet the needs of our music rights holders in order to
   support our highly-engaged, growing global community of over 1.4
   million Members. Peloton is increasingly seen by our partners as an
   impactful music discovery platform, which has created opportunities to
   progressively and meaningfully enhance our classes with custom music
   experiences. We expect this to continue as we invest in music-first
   technology to improve the quality of our Members experience,
   strengthen our competitive advantage over other fitness platforms, and
   add value to our Members.

   Sales and Marketing

   Our goal is to increase brand awareness and purchase intent for our
   Connected Fitness Products and subscriptions. We use a unique
   combination of brand and product-specific performance marketing to
   build brand awareness and generate predictable sales of our Connected
   Fitness Products. In just a few years, Pelotons aided brand awareness
   has grown significantly, and as of April 3, 2019, our aided brand
   awareness in the United States was 67%. Our marketing strategies have
   focused on product education and broadening our demographic reach. Our
   fastest growing demographic segments included Members under the age of
   35 and Members making under $75,000 in annual household income.

   Video has been the strongest medium to communicate the features of the
   Peloton platform. We primarily market through advertisements on
   broadcast and cable television, social media, and over-the-top
   providers such as Hulu and YouTube to reach our target audience,
   focusing on incremental return on investment. Our direct-to-consumer
   model allows us to conduct frequent tests in our sales channels,
   including testing our brand creative and messages, allowing us to
   further optimize marketing spend. We also frequently test alternative
   marketing channels, such as podcasts and other forms of audio
   advertising, as well as direct mailing.


                                    LOGO

   Direct to Consumer, Multi-Channel Sales Model

   We sell our products directly to customers through a multi-channel
   sales platform that includes e-commerce, inside sales, and showrooms.
   Our sales associates use robust customer relationship management tools
   to deliver an elevated, personalized, and educational purchase
   experience, regardless of channel of capture and conversion.
   Integration and coordination across all sales channels is critical to
   the customer journey, evidenced by over 37% of our customers purchasing
   a product or service in a different channel than where they originally
   engaged with Peloton in fiscal 2019.


     

   E-Commerce and Inside Sales: Our desktop and mobile websites,
   www.onepeloton.com, www.onepeloton.co.uk, and www.onepeloton.ca,
   provide an elevated brand experience where visitors can learn about our
   products and services and access product reviews. Our inside sales team
   engages with customers by phone, email, and online chat on our
   websites, and offers one-on-one sales consultations seven days a week.

   Showrooms: Our showrooms allow customers to experience and try our
   products. We provide interactive product demonstrations and many of our
   showrooms have private areas where customers can do a test ride or
   test run. We frequently host Peloton community events in our
   showrooms, which help deepen brand engagement and loyalty.


     

   Commercial: The commercial and hospitality markets represent a small
   percentage of sales but are important to driving trial and brand
   awareness. Our Bikes in hospitality locations help keep our Members
   riding when they travel, creating further Member engagement, loyalty,
   and convenience. Across our markets as of June 30, 2019, there were
   1,298 Peloton Bikes in 696 hotels and resorts.

   Showroom Site Strategy

   As of June 30, 2019, we operated 74 showrooms across the United States,
   Canada and the United Kingdom. Our showrooms are located primarily in
   upscale malls, lifestyle centers, and premium street locations. When
   evaluating potential new markets, we carefully examine historical sales
   data, key demographics, traffic patterns, geographic locations, and
   co-tenancy of other complementary lifestyle-oriented retailers. In the
   United States, we attempt to cluster stores around major urban markets
   and suburbs while also operating in super regional and regional centers
   that draw from a greater trade area. In Canada and the United Kingdom,
   we will continue to focus on major urban markets. We target locations
   where we expect payback of one year or less and positive contributions
   to EBITDA within the first year of operation.

   We operate two showroom formats including our large showrooms which
   range from 1,500 to 2,000 square feet and microstores which are
   typically around 300 square feet. Large showrooms comprise 70% of our
   retail locations and provide space for Connected Fitness Products and
   Peloton-branded apparel, as well as private areas for test rides and
   test runs. Microstores represent 30% of our retail locations and are
   typically placed in highly visible center court areas. Our showroom
   leases are typically five to ten years in lease duration while
   microstores are typically open for up to 1.5 years. Microstores allow
   us to test markets and specific shopping areas, and provide a temporary
   location while searching for the ideal large showroom space.

   Retention Marketing & Member Support Services

   The retention marketing team is focused on driving engagement to help
   us maintain our high Connected Fitness Subscriber retention rates. The
   team develops new ways to promote engagement with our products and
   community or help Members reengage with our platform when activity has
   lapsed. The retention team helps curate goal-based challenges, awards
   digital badges for Member accomplishments, and sends Peloton-branded
   Century Club shirts after a Members 100^th class. The team also
   communicates with Members with no recent activity through email
   campaigns that help encourage these Members to get back to their
   workout routine. The retention marketing team also collects and
   responds to feedback about our platform that is on our closed Facebook
   group of over 180,000 Members as of June 30, 2019.

   In order to bring our community together, we organize several in-person
   events throughout the year including welcoming Members for workouts,
   milestone celebrations, and instructor meet-and-greets at our
   production studios in New York City. We also host Members at our
   showrooms, and celebrate our Members with our flagship Member event,
   Peloton Homecoming, held in New York City each May. At Peloton
   Homecoming 2019, we welcomed nearly 3,000 individuals to New York City
   to participate in three days of events including scheduled talks, a
   community celebration, and fitness classes.

   We outsource the manufacturing of our products to multiple contract
   manufacturers located in Asia. The components used in our products are
   sourced either directly by us or on our behalf by our contract
   manufacturers from a variety of component suppliers. To continue to
   provide our Members with leading fitness technology, our supply chain
   team coordinates the relationships between our contract manufacturers
   and component suppliers. We regularly review our existing contract
   manufacturers and component suppliers, and evaluate new partners and
   suppliers, to ensure that we can scale our manufacturing base as we
   grow.

   We purchase from our primary contract manufacturers on a purchase order
   basis. Under our governing agreements, our contract manufacturers must
   follow our established product design specifications, quality assurance
   programs, and manufacturing standards. We have developed preferred
   relationships with our partners to maintain access to the resources
   needed to scale seasonally and ensure our partners have the requisite
   experience to produce our Connected Fitness Products and accessories.
   We pay for and own certain tooling and equipment specifically required
   to manufacture our products to have control of supply and component
   pipelines. We have purchase commitments based on our purchase orders
   for certain amounts of goods, work-in-progress, and components.

   In order to mitigate against the risks related to a single source of
   supply, we qualify alternative suppliers and manufacturers when
   possible, and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions,
   including maintaining adequate inventory of any single source
   components and products. To date, we have not experienced material
   delays in obtaining any of our components or products.

   At each of our manufacturers facilities, we have a quality team that
   is involved throughout the entire development process. To ensure
   consistent quality, we routinely perform product audits on non-core
   suppliers and staff full-time supplier quality engineers at core
   product manufacturing sites.

   Logistics and Fulfillment

   To control every touchpoint of our product and service offering, we
   have built networks of last mile field operations centers, which have
   further expanded from the United States into Canada and the United
   Kingdom. With 24 locations in major markets of North America and two
   locations in the United Kingdom as of June 30, 2019, our field
   operations team supports in-home delivery of our Connected Fitness
   Products with professional high-touch set up service and ongoing
   in-home service and care. As highly trained experts on our products and
   services, our field specialists offer product education, assistance
   with account set up, and tips and recommendations for product care and
   content selection. As we grow our logistics network, we are able to
   efficiently service, deploy, and install replacement parts to our
   Members over time.

   With our commitment to our Members-first approach, we will continue to
   invest to strengthen our field operations coverage in locations we
   identify as cost-effective delivery markets throughout North America
   and in new international regions. To further scale our distribution
   system and maintain flexibility, we also work with third-party
   fulfillment partners that deliver our products from multiple locations
   in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Third-party
   fulfillment partnerships allow us to reduce order fulfillment time,
   reduce shipping costs, and expand our geographical reach. Our field
   operations performed 58% of Connected Fitness Product deliveries during
   fiscal 2019.

   Intellectual Property

   The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an
   important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of
   patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality
   procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to
   establish and protect our intellectual property. We generally enter
   into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product
   assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control
   access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.

   As of June 30, 2019, we held six issued U.S. patents and had 22 U.S.
   patent applications pending. We also held 13 patent applications
   pending in foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. issued patents expire
   between May 20, 2025 and July 16, 2034. As of


                                     106
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   June 30, 2019, we held 10 registered trademarks in the United States,
   including the Peloton mark and our P logo and also held 63 registered
   trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our
   development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new
   intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent
   applications with respect to our technology.

   Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only
   limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be
   challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated.
   Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary
   rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and,
   therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our
   proprietary technology.

   Government Regulation

   We are subject to many varying laws and regulations in the United
   States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and throughout the
   world, including those related to privacy, data protection, content
   regulation, intellectual property, consumer protection, e-commerce,
   marketing, advertising, messaging, rights of publicity, health and
   safety, employment and labor, product liability, accessibility,
   competition, and taxation. These laws often require companies to
   implement specific information security controls to protect certain
   types of information, such as personal data, special categories of
   personal data or health data. These laws and regulations are
   constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or
   amended in a manner that could harm our current or future business and
   operations. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may
   seek to block or limit our products and services or otherwise impose
   other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of
   any or all of our products and services for an extended period of time
   or indefinitely.

   In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the
   GDPR, became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is intended to create
   a single legal framework that applies across all EU member states.
   However, there are certain areas where EU member states can deviate
   from the requirements in their own legislation. It is therefore likely
   that we will need to comply with these local regulations in addition to
   the GDPR. Local supervisory authorities are able to impose fines for
   non-compliance and have the power to carry out audits, require
   companies to cease or change processing, request information, and
   obtain access to premises. The GDPR created more stringent operational
   requirements for processors and controllers of personal data,
   including, for example, requiring enhanced disclosures to data subjects
   about how personal data is processed (including information about the
   profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making),
   limiting retention periods of personal data, requiring mandatory data
   breach notification, and requiring additional policies and procedures
   to comply with the accountability principle under the GDPR. In
   addition, data subjects have more robust rights with regard to their
   personal data. Similarly, other jurisdictions are instituting privacy
   and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which could increase
   our risk and compliance costs.

   Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding
   cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to the
   transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area, or EEA,
   and the United Kingdom (after Brexit). We rely on transfer mechanisms
   permitted under these laws, including the standard contract clauses,
   which have been subject to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. If these
   existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the
   United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions are unavailable, we may be
   unable to transfer personal data of employees or Members in those
   regions to the United States.

   Competition

   We believe that our first-mover advantage, leading market position,
   brand recognition, and vertically integrated platform set us apart in
   the rapidly growing market for connected, technology-enabled fitness.
   We provide a superior value proposition and benefit from the clear
   endorsement of our Connected Fitness Subscribers, giving us a
   competitive advantage versus traditional fitness and wellness products
   and services, and future potential entrants.

   While we believe we are changing the consumption patterns for fitness
   and growing the market, the main sources of competition include
   in-studio fitness classes, fitness clubs, at-home fitness equipment and
   content, and health and wellness apps.

   The areas in which we compete include:


     

   Consumers and Engagement. We compete for consumers to join our platform
   through Connected Fitness or Digital Subscriptions, and we seek to
   retain them through engagement and community.


                                     107
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

     

   Product Offering. We compete with producers of fitness products and
   work to ensure that our Connected Fitness Products maintain the most
   innovative technology and user-friendly features.


     

   Talent. We compete for talent in every vertical across our company
   including technology, media, fitness, design, logistics, music,
   marketing, finance, legal, and retail. As our platform is highly
   dependent on technology and software, we require a significant base of
   engineers to continue innovating.

   The principal competitive factors that companies in our industry need
   to consider include, but are not limited to: total cost, manufacturing
   efficiency, enhanced products and services, original content, product
   quality and safety, competitive pricing policies, vision for the market
   and product innovation, strength of sales and marketing strategies,
   technological advances, and brand awareness and reputation. We believe
   we compete favorably across all of these factors and we have developed
   a business model that is difficult to replicate.

   Culture and People


   LOGO   The main group of riders in a race.

   Riders in a peloton work together, conserve energy and perform better
   because of one another.

   Mission and Values

   Like our brand, product, and content offerings, our culture is dynamic,
   unique, and framed by our expansive vision and passion for community
   and collaboration. For our people, the purpose and function of our
   culture is clear, and operates as a shared language of values and as a
   way of getting things done that permeates through the many areas in
   which we operate as a company. Our culture is shaped by our four
   primary values, described below:


     

   Put Members First: We obsess over every touchpoint of our Member
   experience. We have a Member-centered mindset that prioritizes a
   positive product and brand experience. We are proud to be pioneers and
   innovators of a global, product-oriented, fitness-centered community.


     

   Operate with a Bias for Action: We value innovation, continuous
   improvement, and challenging the status quo, all of which are keys to
   success in a competitive environment. We move quickly, take smart
   risks, fail fast and learn from failures. We never let the fear of
   imperfection stop us from achieving great things.


     

   Empower Teams of Smart Creatives: We hire individuals who are great at
   what they do, and encourage all of our team members to think openly and
   creatively to solve tough, exciting problems. We empower our team
   members to think and act like owners.


     

   Together We Go Far: As our company name suggests, we know the
   importance and value of a team. We know our collective differences make
   us stronger, and uphold the obligation to dissent and listen. We value
   inclusivity and we are proud that everyone can work to help solve
   difficult problems and have an impact.

   To foster these values, we have committed to promote our One Peloton
   culture:


     

   Best Place to Work: We offer generous benefits and compensation
   packages, including equity to all full-time employees, parental leave,
   health and wellness offerings, family planning assistance, and learning
   and development opportunities.


     

   Commitment to Equal Pay: We conduct an annual third-party audit of team
   members pay to confirm that our pay-for-performance philosophy
   transcends race and gender. If an audit reveals any pay differences
   unexplained by legitimate business factors between team members who
   hold similar jobs, but are of different races or genders, we adjust the
   affected team members respective compensation accordingly.


     

   Social Impact: Our Comeback Initiative recognizes Members and
   non-Members nominated by themselves or others through sharing stories
   about their respective journeys back from a difficult time. Committees
   consisting of Peloton team members determine the individuals to
   recognize and, in turn, develop deeper connections to our community.
   Recognized individuals receive a Peloton Bike and three-year Connected
   Fitness Subscription. We believe this award offers motivation and
   encouragement to support those on their comeback journeys, while
   engaging and activating our community.

   Employees

   We are extremely proud of our team which embodies a diverse mix of
   backgrounds, industries, and levels of experience. As of June 30, 2019,
   we employed approximately 1,800 individuals in the United States across
   our New York City headquarters,


                                     108
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   Plano campus, Atlanta office, showrooms, and 23 field operations
   warehouses. Internationally, we had 94 employees in the United Kingdom
   and Germany across corporate, showroom, and warehouse functions, 34
   employees in Canada largely in showroom and warehouse roles, and 26
   individuals in Taiwan across quality engineering and operations
   functions. Certain of our instructors are covered by collective
   bargaining agreements with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation
   of Television and Radio Artists, or SAG-AFTRA. However, we are not
   signatories to any agreements with SAG-AFTRA. With the exception of
   SAG-AFTRA, none of our domestic employees are currently represented by
   a labor organization or a party to any collective bargaining. We also
   hire additional seasonal employees in our field operations, member
   support, and showrooms during the holiday season.

   Facilities

   Our corporate headquarters are located in New York City, where we
   occupy facilities totaling approximately 65,000 rentable square feet
   under a lease that expires in 2027. We use these facilities primarily
   for technology, product design, research and development, sales and
   marketing, supply chain and logistics, finance, legal, human resources,
   and information technology. In November 2018, we entered into a lease
   agreement for our planned new corporate headquarters in New York City,
   which we intend to occupy by the fall of 2020 and which consists of
   approximately 312,000 square feet under a 16-year lease. We also have a
   Member support and sales team located in Plano, Texas, where we occupy
   approximately 28,000 rentable square feet under a lease that expires in
   2023.

   In addition to our corporate headquarters and regional campus, we
   currently operate two small programming hubs in New York City where we
   produce our content and offer fitness classes. In December 2017, we
   entered into a twenty-year lease for approximately 36,000 rentable
   square feet in New York City, which will include four production
   studios and adjacent office space. In September 2018, we entered into a
   lease for 11 Floral Street in London, which will serve as our content
   production hub for Europe and has 31,150 rentable square feet. We
   expect to open this London location in Fall 2020. We currently operate
   a temporary production studio in London where we produce local indoor
   cycling content. We also lease office space and showrooms for our
   products in 74 locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and
   Canada as of June 30, 2019.

   We intend to procure additional space as we add employees and expand
   geographically. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our
   needs for the immediate future and that suitable additional space will
   be available to accommodate any expansion of our operations as needed.

   Legal Proceedings

   VR Optics

   On August 11, 2016, VR Optics, LLC, or VR Optics, filed a lawsuit
   against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
   York, alleging that we are infringing U.S. Patent No. 6,902,513 titled
   Interactive fitness equipment, or the 513 patent. On November 7,
   2016, we filed counterclaims against VR Optics for declaratory judgment
   of non-infringement and invalidity and intentional interference with
   our contractual relationship with Villency Design Group, LLC, or VDG, a
   product design company we hired in 2012 to help design the Peloton
   Bike. We also filed an amended third-party complaint against VDG for
   breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and
   Eric Villency and Joseph Coffey, the owners of VR Optics and VDG, for
   intentional interference with our contractual relationship with VDG.
   Among other things, we seek to enforce VDGs contractual obligation to
   defend and indemnify us for intellectual property claims, including the
   patent claim asserted by VR Optics.

   On December 9, 2016, VR Optics and VDG moved to dismiss all our
   non-patent counterclaims. In response, we amended our counterclaims to
   add a new claim against VDG for its fraudulent concealment of a
   potential patent infringement claim against us when Mr. Villency and
   Mr. Coffey first sought to acquire the 513 patent, which was prior to
   the expiration of our contract with VDG. On January 20, 2017, VR
   Optics, VDG, Mr. Villency, and Mr. Coffey filed a motion to dismiss the
   third-party complaint and one of our non-patent counterclaims against
   VR Optics. The motion to dismiss was denied on August 18, 2017. Fact
   discovery concluded on February 1, 2019. Expert discovery is complete.
   Summary judgment motions were filed by both parties in early July 2019
   and decisions on them are pending. There is currently no trial date
   set.

   We intend to defend the claims made against us and to prosecute the
   counterclaims presented. Litigation, however, is inherently uncertain,
   and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against us or settlement
   could materially and adversely impact our business, financial
   condition, operating results, and prospects. In addition, litigation
   can involve significant management time and attention, and the cost of
   litigation can be expensive, regardless of outcome.

   Downtown Music Publishing

   On March 19, 2019, Downtown Music Publishing LLC, ole Media Management,
   L.P., Big Deal Music, LLC, CYPMP, LLC, Peer International Corporation,
   PSO Limited, Peermusic Ltd., Peermusic III, Ltd., Peertunes, Ltd.,
   Songs of Peer Ltd., Reservoir Media Management, Inc., The Richmond
   Organization, Inc., Round Hill Music LLC, The Royalty Network, Inc.,
   and Ultra International Music Publishing, LLC filed a lawsuit against
   us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,
   captioned Downtown Music Publg LLC, et. al v. Peloton Interactive,
   Inc., alleging that we engaged in copyright infringement by using
   certain accused songs in classes without necessary licenses. The
   plaintiffs allege that they are music publishers that own or control
   the copyrights in numerous musical works that were synchronized by us
   without the plaintiffs authorization. The complaint asserts a single
   claim for copyright infringement. It seeks injunctive relief, more than
   $150 million in damages, and attorneys fees and costs.

   The plaintiffs served us with the summons and complaint on March 21,
   2019. On April 30, 2019, we answered the complaint and filed
   counterclaims against the original named plaintiffs and National Music
   Publishers Association, Inc., a trade association, alleging that they
   coordinated to collectively negotiate licenses in violation of the
   antitrust laws. Our counterclaims also assert that the trade
   association tortiously interfered with Pelotons attempts to engage in
   direct negotiations with music publishers in violation of state law.
   The counterclaims seek injunctive relief, monetary damages (to be
   trebled under applicable statute), and attorneys fees and costs. An
   amended complaint filed on May 31, 2019 named additional plaintiffs
   Greensleeves Publishing Ltd., Me Gusta Music, LLC, Raleigh Music
   Publishing LLC, STB Music, Inc., and TuneCore, Inc. and identified
   additional musical works. We answered the amended complaint on June 14,
   2019. On June 24, 2019, counter-defendants filed a motion to dismiss
   the counterclaims, to which we filed an opposition on August 8, 2019.
   Discovery on the claims and counterclaims is ongoing in the case.

   We intend to defend the claims made against us and to prosecute the
   counterclaims presented. Litigation, however, is inherently uncertain,
   and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against us or settlement
   could materially and adversely impact our business, financial
   condition, operating results, and prospects. In addition, litigation
   can involve significant management time and attention, and the cost of
   litigation can be expensive, regardless of outcome.

   Other

   We are and, from time to time, we may become involved in legal
   proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of
   our business. We are not presently a party to any other legal
   proceedings that in the opinion of our management, if determined
   adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material
   adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition,
   or cash flows.

   Executive Officers

   John Foley is one of our co-founders and has served as our Chief
   Executive Officer since June 2012 and chairman of our board of
   directors since April 2015 when we converted from a limited liability
   company to a Delaware corporation. Before our founding, Mr. Foley
   served as the President of eCommerce at Barnes & Noble, Inc., a
   retailer of content, digital media, and educational products, from
   August 2010 to June 2012. From March 2005 to August 2010, Mr. Foley
   served as the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Pronto.com, a
   price comparison service platform and a subsidiary of
   IAC/InterActiveCorp, a media and internet company. Mr. Foley holds a
   B.S. in Industrial Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology
   and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. We believe Mr. Foley is
   qualified to serve on our board of directors because of the historical
   knowledge, operational expertise, leadership, and continuity that he
   brings to our board of directors as our co-founder and Chief Executive
   Officer.

   William Lynch has served as our President since January 2017 and as a
   member of our board of directors since August 2019. Prior to joining
   us, Mr. Lynch served as the Chief Executive Officer of Savant Systems,
   LLC, a luxury smart home technology company, from May 2014 to November
   2016. From March 2010 to June 2013, Mr. Lynch served as the Chief
   Executive Officer of Barnes & Noble, and from February 2009 to March
   2010, Mr. Lynch served as the President of Barnes & Noble.com, a
   business division of Barnes & Noble, where he oversaw the creation of
   the Nook product line and software. Mr. Lynch has also held senior
   management roles at HSN.com, IAC/InterActiveCorp, and Palm Computing.
   Mr. Lynch previously served on the board of directors of Barnes & Noble
   from October 2011 to July 2013. Mr. Lynch holds a B.S. in Economics
   from the University of Texas at Austin and an M.B.A. from Columbia
   Business School. We believe Mr. Lynch is qualified to serve on our
   board of directors because of the strategic and operational experience
   and leadership that he brings as our President and the former chief
   executive officer and executive leader of public and private companies.

   Jill Woodworth has served as our Chief Financial Officer since April
   2018. From April 2006 to April 2018, Ms. Woodworth served as a Managing
   Director for J.P. Morgan, a multinational investment bank and financial
   services company. From July 1994 to April 2006, Ms. Woodworth worked in

   investment bank and financial services company, where she held various
   positions within equity capital markets and client coverage.

   of, our board of directors. There are no family relationships among any

   Board of Directors Composition

   vacancies. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of
   incorporation as in effect prior to the completion of this offering and
   amended and restated voting agreement, Mses. Boone and Thomas-Graham

   restated bylaws that will become effective upon the completion of this
   offering. Each of our current directors

   will continue to serve until the election and qualification of his or
   her successor, or his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal.

   Classified Board of Directors

   Our restated certificate of incorporation that will be in effect upon
   the completion of this offering provides that, upon the completion of
   this offering, our board of directors will be divided into three
   classes with staggered three-year terms. Upon expiration of the term of
   a class of directors, directors for that class will be elected for
   three-year terms at the annual meeting of stockholders in the year in
   which that term expires. As a result, only one class of directors will
   be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders, with the other
   classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year
   terms. Each directors term will continue until the election and
   qualification of his or her successor, or his or her earlier death,
   resignation, or removal. Our directors will be divided among the three
   classes as follows:


     

   Class I directors, whose initial term will expire at the annual meeting
   of stockholders to be held in fiscal 2021, will consist of Howard
   Draft, Erik Blachford, and Pamela Thomas-Graham;


     

   Class II directors, whose initial term will expire at the annual
   meeting of stockholders to be held in fiscal 2022, will consist of John
   Callaghan and Jay Hoag; and


     

   Class III directors, whose initial term will expire at the annual
   meeting of stockholders to be held in fiscal 2023, will consist of John
   Foley, William Lynch, and Karen Boone.

   Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws that will
   be in effect upon the completion of this offering provide that only our
   board of directors may fill vacancies on our board. Any additional
   directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors
   will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as
   possible, each class will consist of one-third of the total number of
   directors.

   The classification of our board of directors may have the effect of
   delaying or preventing changes in our control or management. See the
   section titled Description of Capital StockAnti-Takeover
   ProvisionsRestated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws
   Provisions for additional information.

   Director Independence

   Our Class A common stock will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select
   Market. Under the rules of Nasdaq, independent directors must comprise
   a majority of a listed companys board of directors within a specified
   period of the completion of this offering. In addition, rules require
   that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed
   companys audit, compensation, and nominating, governance, and
   corporate responsibility committees be independent. Under rules, a
   director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the
   opinion of that companys board of directors, that person does not have
   a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent
   judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

   Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set
   forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. In order to be considered
   independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee
   of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a
   member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other
   board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting,
   advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of
   its subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company
   or any of its subsidiaries. We intend to satisfy the audit committee
   independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 as of the closing of this
   offering.

   Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of
   each director and considered whether each director has a material
   relationship with us that could compromise his or her ability to
   exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her
   responsibilities. As a result of this review, our board of directors
   determined that Mses. Boone and Thomas-Graham and Messrs. Blachford,
   Callaghan, Draft, and Hoag are independent directors as defined under
   the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing
   requirements and rules of Nasdaq. In making these determinations, our
   board of directors reviewed and discussed information provided by the
   directors and us with regard to each directors business and personal
   activities and current and prior relationships as they may relate to us
   and our management, including the beneficial ownership of our capital
   stock by each non-employee director and the transactions involving them
   described in the section titled Certain Relationships and Related
   Party Transactions.

   that Ms. Boone is an audit committee financial expert as defined in
   Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.
   This designation does not impose on Ms. Boone any duties, obligations,
   or liabilities that are greater than are generally imposed on members

   standards and SEC rules and regulations. Each member of this committee
   is a non-employee director, as defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
   the Exchange Act. Our compensation committee is responsible for, among
   other things:


     

   reviewing and approving the compensation and the terms of any
   compensatory agreements of our executive officers;

   Board Diversity

   Each year, our nominating, governance, and corporate responsibility
   committee will review, with the board of directors, the appropriate
   characteristics, skills and experience required for the board of
   directors as a whole and its individual members. In evaluating the
   suitability of individual candidates, our nominating, governance, and
   corporate responsibility committee will consider factors including,
   without limitation, an individuals character, integrity, judgment,
   potential conflicts of interest, other commitments, and diversity.
   While we have no formal policy regarding board diversity for our board
   of directors as a whole nor for each individual member, the nominating,
   governance, and corporate responsibility committee does consider such
   factors as gender, race, ethnicity and experience, area of expertise,
   as well as other individual attributes that contribute to the total
   diversity of viewpoints and experience represented on the board of
   directors.

   Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

   Equity Compensation

   From time to time, we have granted equity awards in the form of stock

   outstanding stock options to purchase shares of our Class B common
   stock that were granted under our 2015 Plan, as set forth in the
   Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table below.

   Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation

   company performance metrics, including global net revenue and adjusted
   EBITDA. For fiscal 2018, the target bonus amounts were $500,000 for
   Messrs. Foley and Lynch. For fiscal 2019, the target bonus amounts were
   $750,000 for Ms. Woodworth and Messrs. Foley and Lynch. Amounts earned

   Employee Benefit Plans

   We believe that our ability to grant equity-based awards is a valuable
   compensation tool that enables us to attract, retain, and motivate our
   employees, consultants, and directors by aligning their financial
   interests with those of our stockholders. The principal features of our
   equity incentive plans are summarized below. These summaries are
   qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual text of the
   plans, which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of
   which this prospectus is a part.

   2015 Stock Plan

   Our board of directors adopted our 2015 Plan in April 2015, which was
   subsequently approved by our stockholders. Our board of directors, or a
   committee thereof appointed by our board of directors, administers the
   2015 Plan and the awards granted thereunder. Awards under our 2015 Plan
   are for shares of our Class B common stock.

   The 2015 Plan provides for the grant of both incentive stock options,
   which qualify for favorable tax treatment to their recipients under
   Section 422 of the Code, and nonqualified stock options, as well as for
   the issuance of restricted stock awards, or RSAs. We may grant
   incentive stock options only to our employees. We may grant
   nonqualified stock options and RSAs to our employees, directors, and
   consultants. We refer to such employees, directors, or consultants who
   receive an award under our 2015 Plan as participants.

   The exercise price of each stock option must be at least equal to the
   fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The maximum
   permitted term of options granted under our 2015 Plan is ten years.
   Options generally vest subject to continued service, and will cease to
   vest on the date a participant ceases to provide services to us and all
   then unvested options will be forfeited. Our board of directors, or a
   committee thereof, may provide for options to be exercised only as they
   vest or to be immediately exercisable with any shares issued on
   exercise being subject to our right of repurchase that lapses as the
   shares vest. Stock options granted under the 2015 Plan generally may be
   exercised, to the extent vested as of the date of termination, for a
   period of three months after the termination of the optionees service
   to us, for a period of six months in the case of disability, for a
   period of 12 months in the case of death or such longer or shorter
   period as our compensation committee may provide, but in any event no
   later than the expiration date of the stock option.

   An RSA is an offer by us to sell shares subject to restrictions, which
   may vest based on time or achievement of performance conditions. The
   price, if any, of an RSA will be determined by our board of directors,
   or a committee thereof. Unless otherwise determined at the time of
   award, vesting will cease on the date the participant ceases to provide
   services to us and unvested shares will be forfeited to or repurchased
   by us.

   In the event there is a specified type of change in our capital
   structure without our receipt of consideration, such as a stock split,
   appropriate adjustments will be made as set forth in the 2015 Plan. In
   the event of a merger or consolidation, or in the event of a sale of
   all or substantially all of our assets, outstanding awards under our
   2015 Plan shall be subject to the agreement evidencing the transaction
   (or, in the event the transaction does not include such an agreement,
   as determined by our board of directors), which need not treat all
   outstanding awards in an identical manner, and may include one or more
   of the following: (1) the continuation of the outstanding awards;
   (2) the assumption of the outstanding awards by the surviving
   corporation or its parent; (3) the substitution by the surviving
   corporation or its parent of new options for the outstanding options
   and new RSAs for the outstanding RSAs; (4) the cancellation of vested
   stock options or RSAs in exchange for a payment equal to the value of
   the per share consideration payable to holders of our common stock in
   the transaction and, in respect of options, less the options exercise
   price (this payment may be zero if the option or RSA has no value); (5)
   the cancellation of the outstanding awards for no consideration; (6)
   the suspension of the right to exercise options for a limited period if
   administratively necessary; or (7) the termination of early exercise
   rights so that outstanding awards may only be exercised for vested
   shares after the transaction. Our board of directors has discretion to
   accelerate, in whole or part, the vesting and exercisability of an
   option or other award in connection with a corporate transaction as
   described above.

Table of Contents

   As of June 30, 2019, we had reserved 84,008,954 shares of our Class B
   common stock for issuance under our 2015 Plan. As of June 30, 2019,
   options to purchase 64,602,124 shares had been granted and remained
   outstanding and 9,085,593 shares remained available for future grant.
   The stock options outstanding as of June 30, 2019 had a
   weighted-average exercise price of $22.05 per share. We also granted
   options to purchase 664,050 shares under the 2015 Plan subsequent to
   June 30, 2019, with an exercise price of $17.22 per share. Our 2019
   Plan (described below) will be effective upon the date immediately
   prior to the effective date of the registration statement of which this
   prospectus forms a part. As a result, we will not grant any additional
   equity awards under the 2015 Plan following that date, and the 2015
   Plan will terminate at that time. However, any outstanding stock
   options will remain outstanding, subject to the terms of our 2015 Plan
   and the applicable stock option agreements evidencing such awards,
   until such outstanding awards are exercised, or until they terminate or
   expire by their terms. Upon the effectiveness of our 2019 Plan, the
   shares reserved but not issued or subject to outstanding awards under
   our 2015 Plan will become available for grant and issuance under our
   2019 Plan as Class A common stock.

   2019 Equity Incentive Plan

   In                      2019, our board of directors adopted and our
   stockholders approved our 2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan will become
   effective on the date immediately prior to the effective date of the
   registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and will
   serve as the successor to our 2015 Plan. Our board of directors has
   delegated its authority to administer the 2019 Plan to our compensation
   committee.

   Our 2019 Plan provides for the award of both incentive stock options,
   which are intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment under
   Section 422 of the Code, and nonqualified stock options, as well as for
   RSAs, stock appreciation rights, or SARs, restricted stock units, or
   RSUs, performance awards, and stock bonuses. We may grant incentive
   stock options only to our employees. We may grant all other types of
   awards to our employees, directors, and consultants. We refer to
   employees, directors, or consultants who receive an award under our
   2019 Plan as participants.

   We reserved                shares of our Class A common stock to be
   issued under our 2019 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance
   under our 2019 Plan will increase automatically on July 1 of each of
   2020 through 2029 by the number of shares of our Class A common stock
   equal to 5% of the total outstanding shares of all of our classes of
   common stock as of the immediately preceding June 30. However, our
   board of directors may reduce the amount of the increase in any
   particular year. In addition, the following shares will be available
   for grant and issuance under our 2019 Plan as shares of our Class A
   common stock (and any shares of our Class B common stock from our 2015
   Plan that become available for grant under our 2019 Plan will be issued
   as Class A common stock):


     

   shares subject to issuance upon exercise of any stock option or SAR
   granted under our 2019 Plan but which cease to be subject to the stock
   option or SAR for any reason other than exercise of stock options or
   SARs;


     

   shares subject to awards granted under our 2019 Plan that are forfeited
   or are repurchased by us at the original issue price;


     

   shares subject to awards granted under our 2019 Plan that otherwise
   terminate without such shares being issued;


     

   shares surrendered, cancelled, or exchanged for cash or a different
   award (or combination thereof, but to the extent an award under the
   2019 Plan is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment
   will not result in reducing the number of shares available for issuance
   under the 2019 Plan);


     

   any reserved shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under

     

   shares that are subject to stock options or other awards granted under
   our 2015 Plan that cease to be subject to such options or other awards
   by forfeiture or otherwise after the effective date of our 2019 Plan;

   The exercise price of each stock option must be at least equal to the
   fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The maximum
   permitted term of options granted under our 2019 Plan is ten years. The
   compensation committee may provide for options to be exercised only as
   they vest or to be immediately exercisable with any shares issued on
   exercise being subject to our right of repurchase that lapses as the
   shares vest. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan generally may be
   exercised, to the extent vested as of the date of termination, for a
   period of three months after the termination of the optionees service
   to us, for a period of 12 months in the case of death or disability, or
   such longer or shorter period as our compensation committee may
   provide, but in any event no later than the expiration date of the
   stock option. Stock options generally terminate immediately upon
   termination of employment for cause.

   An RSA is an offer by us to sell shares of our Class A common stock
   subject to restrictions, which may vest subject to continued service
   and/or the achievement of performance conditions. The price, if any, of
   an RSA will be determined by the compensation committee. Unless
   otherwise determined by the compensation committee at the time of
   award, vesting will cease on the date the holder of the RSA no longer
   provides services to us and unvested shares will be forfeited to or
   repurchased by us.

   SARs provide for a payment, or payments, in cash or shares of our
   Class A common stock, to the holder based upon the difference between
   the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of
   exercise and the stated exercise price at grant. SARs may vest subject
   to continued service and/or the achievement of performance conditions;
   provided that no SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of 10
   years from the date the SAR is granted.

   RSUs represent the right to receive shares of our Class A common stock
   at a specified date in the future, subject to continued service and/or
   the achievement of performance conditions. If an RSU has not been
   forfeited, then on the date specified in the RSU agreement, we will
   deliver to the holder of the RSU whole shares of our Class A common
   stock, cash, or a combination of our Class A common stock and cash.

   Performance awards cover shares of our Class A common stock and may be
   settled upon achievement of the pre-established performance conditions
   as provided in the 2019 Plan in cash, by issuance of the underlying
   shares, other property, or any combination of the foregoing.

   Stock bonuses may be granted as additional compensation for service or
   performance, and may be settled in the form of cash, Class A common
   stock, or a combination thereof, and may be subject to restrictions,
   which may vest subject to continued service and/or the achievement of
   performance conditions.

   In the event of a change in the number of outstanding shares of our
   Class A common stock without consideration by reason of a stock
   dividend, extraordinary dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
   stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, combination,
   consolidation, reclassification, spin-off, or similar change in our
   capital structure, appropriate proportional adjustments will be made to
   the number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan; the
   exercise prices, number, and class of shares subject to outstanding
   options or SARs; the number and class of shares subject to other
   outstanding awards; and any applicable maximum award limits with
   respect to incentive stock options.

   In the event of a corporate transaction which constitutes a change of
   control, any or all outstanding awards may be (1) continued by the
   company, if the company is the successor entity; (2) assumed or
   substituted by the successor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary of
   the successor corporation, for substantially equivalent awards
   (including, but not limited to a payment in cash or other right to
   acquire the same consideration paid to stockholders of the company upon
   a change of control). In the event a successor corporation refuses to
   assume or substitute outstanding awards, then such awards will become
   fully vested and, as applicable, exercisable, immediately prior to the
   consummation of the proposed change of control. For purposes of the
   foregoing, any awards subject to outstanding performance-based criteria
   that are not assumed will be deemed earned and vested at 100% of target
   level unless otherwise indicated in an applicable award agreement.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a change in control, any
   outstanding awards granted to our non-employee directors under the 2019
   Plan will become vested and exercisable, as applicable, prior to the
   consummation of the change in control.

   A corporate transaction generally includes (1) a person becoming the
   beneficial owner of our securities representing more than 50% of our
   total voting power; (2) the consummation of our sale or disposition of
   all or substantially all of our assets; (3) the consummation of our
   merger or consolidation with any other corporation, except where we
   retain at least 50% of our total voting power; (4) any other
   transaction which qualifies as a corporate transaction under
   Section 424(a) of the Code wherein our stockholders give up all of
   their equity interest in us; or (5) a change in our effective control
   that

   occurs on the date that a majority of members of our board is replaced
   during any 12-month period by members whose appointment or election is
   not endorsed by a majority of the members of our board of directors
   prior to the date of the appointment or election.

   All awards will be subject to clawback or recoupment pursuant to any
   compensation clawback or recoupment policy adopted by our board of
   directors or required by law during the term of service of the award
   holder, to the extent set forth in such policy or applicable agreement.

   Our 2019 Plan will terminate 10 years from the date our board of
   directors approves the plan, unless it is terminated earlier by our
   board of directors. Our board of directors may amend or terminate our
   2019 Plan at any time, subject to stockholder approval as may be
   required by applicable law or listing rules. No termination or
   amendment of the 2019 Plan may adversely affect any then-outstanding
   award without the consent of the affected participant.

   2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   In                      2019, our board of directors adopted and our
   stockholders approved our 2019 ESPP. The 2019 ESPP will become
   effective on the effective date of the registration statement of which
   this prospectus forms a part. We have adopted the 2019 ESPP in order to
   enable eligible employees to purchase shares of our Class A common
   stock at a discount following the date of this offering. Our 2019 ESPP
   is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under
   Section 423 of the Code. We initially reserved                  shares
   of our Class A common stock for issuance under our 2019 ESPP. The
   number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2019 ESPP will
   increase automatically on July 1 of each of 2020 through 2029 by the
   number of shares equal to 1% of the total outstanding shares of all of
   our classes of common stock as of the immediately preceding June 30,
   provided that no more than                          shares may be
   issued over the term of the 2019 ESPP. However, our board of directors
   may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year.

   Our board of directors has delegated its authority to administer the
   2019 ESPP to our compensation committee. Employees eligible to
   participate in any offering pursuant to the 2019 ESPP generally include
   any employee that is employed by us or certain of our designated
   subsidiaries at the beginning of the offering period, provided that the
   committee may exclude employees who fail to meet certain service-based
   or other requirements to the extent permitted by law. Under our 2019
   ESPP, eligible employees will be able to acquire shares of our Class A
   common stock by accumulating funds through payroll deductions.
   Generally, our eligible employees will be able to select a rate of
   payroll deduction between 1% and 15% of their base cash compensation.
   Our board of directors has the authority to amend or terminate our 2019
   ESPP, provided that except in certain circumstances such amendment or
   termination may not materially impair any outstanding purchase rights
   without the holders consent. Our 2019 ESPP will terminate on the tenth
   anniversary of its effective date, unless it is terminated earlier by
   our board of directors.

   The 2019 ESPP will be administered through a series of offering
   periods, which in no event may be longer than 27 months. Each offering
   period may itself consistent of one or more purchase periods. Unless
   otherwise determined by the board of directors or compensation
   committee, the company currently intends to establish offering periods
   of 24-months, each consisting of four six-month purchase periods.

   The purchase price for shares of our Class A common stock purchased
   under our 2019 ESPP will be 85% of the lesser of the fair market value
   of our Class A common stock on (1) the first business day of the
   applicable offering period and (2) the last business day of each
   purchase period in the applicable offering period, but in no event less
   than the par value of a share.

   No participant will have the right to purchase shares of our Class A
   common stock in an amount, when aggregated with purchase rights under
   all our employee stock purchase plans that are also in effect in the
   same calendar year, that have a fair market value of more than $25,000,
   determined as of the first day of the applicable purchase period, for
   each calendar year in which that right is outstanding. In addition, no
   participant will be permitted to purchase more than 2,500 shares of our
   Class A common stock during any one purchase period, or a lesser amount
   determined by our compensation committee.

   If the number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock is
   changed by stock dividend, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock
   split, subdivision, combination, reclassification, or similar change in
   our capital structure without consideration, then our compensation
   committee will proportionately adjust the number and class of common
   stock that is


                                     124
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   available under the 2019 ESPP, the purchase price and number of shares
   any participant has elected to purchase as well as the maximum number
   of shares which may be purchased by participants.

   If we experience a change of control transaction, any offering period
   that commenced prior to the closing of the proposed change of control
   transaction will be shortened and terminated on a new purchase date.
   The new purchase date will occur on or prior to the closing of the
   proposed change of control transaction, and our 2019 ESPP will then
   terminate on the closing of the proposed change of control.

   401(k) Plan

   We maintain a broad-based 401(k) plan that provides eligible U.S.
   employees with an opportunity to defer eligible compensation up to
   certain annual limits. As a tax-qualified retirement plan,
   contributions to the 401(k) plan are deductible by us when made, and
   contributions and earnings on those amounts are generally not taxable
   to the employees until withdrawn or distributed from the 401(k) plan.

   Limitation of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers

   Our restated certificate of incorporation that will become effective in
   connection with the completion of this offering contains provisions
   that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the
   fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Consequently, our directors will
   not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages
   for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for:


     

   any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;


     

   any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional
   misconduct or a knowing violation of law;


     

   unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or
   redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the DGCL; or


     

   any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
   benefit.

   Our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws that
   will become effective in connection with the completion of this
   offering require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the
   maximum extent not prohibited by the DGCL and allow us to indemnify
   other employees and agents as set forth in the DGCL. Subject to certain
   limitations, our restated bylaws also require us to advance expenses
   incurred by our directors and officers for the defense of any action
   for which indemnification is required or permitted.

   We have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into separate
   indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, and certain of
   our other employees, in addition to the indemnification provided for in
   our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws. These
   agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify our directors,
   officers, and key employees for certain expenses, including attorneys
   fees, judgments, penalties, fines, and settlement amounts actually
   incurred by these individuals in any action or proceeding arising out
   of their service to us or any of our subsidiaries or any other company
   or enterprise to which these individuals provide services at our
   request. Subject to certain limitations, our indemnification agreements
   also require us to advance expenses incurred by our directors,
   officers, and key employees for the defense of any action for which
   indemnification is required or permitted.

   We believe that provisions of our restated certificate of
   incorporation, restated bylaws, and indemnification agreements are
   necessary to attract and retain qualified directors, officers, and key
   employees. We also maintain directors and officers liability
   insurance.

   The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our
   restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may
   discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors
   and officers for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce
   the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and
   officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and
   other stockholders. Further, a stockholders investment may be
   adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement
   and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these
   indemnification provisions.


                                     125
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any
   of our directors or executive officers as to which indemnification is
   required or permitted, and we are not aware of any threatened
   litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for
   indemnification.

   Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
   Act may be permitted to directors, executive officers, or persons
   controlling us, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC,
   such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
   Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

   with, a member of that committee, in which event the transaction must
   be reviewed and approved by our nominating, governance, and corporate
   responsibility committee.

   Prior to this offering we had no formal, written policy or procedure

   practice has been to have all related party transactions reviewed and
   approved by a majority of the disinterested members of our board of

                        DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

   The following description summarizes the most important terms of our
   capital stock, as they will be in effect following this offering.
   Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all the information
   that may be important to you. We expect to adopt a restated certificate
   of incorporation and restated bylaws that will become effective upon
   the completion of this offering, and this description summarizes
   provisions that are expected to be included in these documents. For a
   complete description, you should refer to our restated certificate of
   incorporation and restated bylaws, which are included as exhibits to
   the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, and
   to the applicable provisions of Delaware law.

   Upon the completion of this offering, our authorized capital stock will
   consist of                shares of our Class A common stock, $0.000025
   par value per share,                shares of our Class B common stock,
   $0.000025 par value per share, and                 shares of
   undesignated preferred stock, $0.000025 par value per share.

   Assuming the conversion and reclassification of all outstanding shares
   of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into 210,640,629 shares
   of our Class B common stock, which will occur in connection with the
   completion of this offering, as of June 30, 2019, there were
   outstanding:


     

   zero shares of our Class A common stock;


     

   235,942,233 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding, held by
   approximately 428 stockholders of record;


     

   64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon exercise of
   outstanding stock options, with a weighted-average exercise price of
   $6.71 per share; and


     

   240,000 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon exercise of a
   warrant, with an exercise price of $0.19 per share.

   Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock

   Dividend Rights

   Subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock
   outstanding at the time, the holders of our common stock are entitled
   to receive dividends out of funds legally available if our board of
   directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and then
   only at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors may
   determine. See the section titled Dividend Policy for additional
   information.

   Voting Rights

   Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each
   share of Class A common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote
   of stockholders and holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to
   20 votes for each share of Class B common stock held on all matters
   submitted to a vote of stockholders. Following this offering, the
   holders of our outstanding Class B common stock will hold     % of the
   voting power of our outstanding capital stock, with our directors,
   executive officers, and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates
   holding     % of the voting power in the aggregate. Holders of shares
   of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a
   single class on all matters (including the election of directors)
   submitted to a vote of stockholders, unless otherwise required by
   Delaware law or our restated certificate of incorporation. Delaware law
   could require either holders of our Class A common stock or Class B
   common stock to vote separately as a single class in the following
   circumstances:


     

   if we were to seek to amend our restated certificate of incorporation
   to increase or decrease the par value of a class of our capital stock,
   then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the
   proposed amendment; and


     

   if we were to seek to amend our restated certificate of incorporation
   in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences, or special
   rights of a class of our capital stock in a manner that affected its
   holders adversely, then that class would be required to vote separately
   to approve the proposed amendment.

   Our restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for
   cumulative voting for the election of directors. As a result, the
   holders of a majority of our voting shares can elect all of the
   directors then standing for election. Our restated certificate of
   incorporation establishes a classified board of directors, to be
   divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. Only one
   class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our
   stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of
   their respective three-year terms.

   No Preemptive or Similar Rights

   Our common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not
   subject to redemption or sinking fund provisions.

   Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions

   Upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, the assets legally
   available for distribution to our stockholders would be distributable
   ratably among the holders of our common stock and any participating
   preferred stock outstanding at that time, subject to the prior
   satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the
   preferential rights of and the payment of liquidation preferences, if
   any, on any shares of preferred stock outstanding at that time.

   Change of Control Transactions

   In the case of any distribution or payment in respect of the shares of
   our Class A common stock or Class B common stock upon a merger or
   consolidation with or into any other entity, or other substantially
   similar transaction, the holders of our Class A common stock and
   Class B common stock will be treated equally and identically with
   respect to shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock owned
   by them, unless the only difference in the per share distribution to
   the holders of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock is
   that any securities distributed to the holder of a share Class B common
   stock have 20 times the voting power of any securities distributed to
   the holder of a share of Class A common stock, or such merger,
   consolidation, or other transaction is approved by the affirmative vote
   of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A
   common stock and Class B common stock, each voting as a separate class.

   Subdivisions and Combinations

   If we subdivide or combine in any manner outstanding shares of Class A
   common stock or Class B common stock, the outstanding shares of the
   other class will be subdivided or combined in the same manner, unless
   different treatment of the shares of each class is approved by the
   affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
   of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, each voting as a
   separate class.

   Conversion

   Each outstanding share of Class B common stock is convertible at any
   time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common
   stock. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert
   automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon any transfer,
   whether or not for value, which occurs after the closing of this
   offering, except for certain permitted transfers described in our
   restated certificate of incorporation, including transfers to family
   members, trusts solely for the benefit of the stockholder or their
   family members, and partnerships, corporations, and other entities
   exclusively owned by the stockholder or their family members. Once
   converted or transferred and converted into Class A common stock, the
   Class B common stock may not be reissued.

   All the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock will convert
   automatically into shares of our Class A common stock upon the date
   that is the earlier of (i) the date specified by a vote of the holders
   of 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii)
   ten years from the closing of this offering, and (iii) the date the
   shares of Class B common stock cease to represent at least 1% of all
   outstanding shares of our common stock. Following such conversion, each
   share of Class A common stock will have one vote per share and the
   rights of the holders of all outstanding common stock will be
   identical. Once converted into Class A common stock, the Class B common
   stock may not be reissued.

   Preferred Stock

   Pursuant to the provisions of our restated certificate of
   incorporation, each currently outstanding share of redeemable
   convertible preferred stock will automatically be converted into one
   share of Class B common stock effective upon the completion of this
   offering. Following this offering, no shares of redeemable convertible
   preferred stock will be outstanding.

   Following the completion of this offering, our board of directors will
   be authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to
   issue preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time to
   time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the
   designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each
   series and any of its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions, in
   each case without further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board
   of directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of any
   series of preferred stock, but not below the number of shares of that
   series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our
   stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of
   preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely
   affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common
   stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in
   connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes,
   could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring, or
   preventing a change in control of our company and might adversely
   affect the market price of our Class A common stock


                                     135

   and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common
   stock and Class B common stock. We have no current plans to issue any
   shares of preferred stock.

   Stock Options

   As of June 30, 2019, we had outstanding options to purchase an
   aggregate of 64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock, with a
   weighted-average exercise price of $6.71 per share, pursuant to our
   2015 Plan. Since June 30, 2019, we have granted options to purchase an
   aggregate of 664,050 shares of our Class B common stock, with an
   exercise price of $22.05 per share, pursuant to our 2015 Stock Plan.

   Warrant

   As of June 30, 2019, we had outstanding a warrant to purchase 240,000
   shares of our Class B common stock at an exercise price of $0.19, which
   expires in June 2025. The warrant has a cashless exercise provision
   pursuant to which the holder, in lieu of paying the exercise price in
   cash, can surrender the warrant and receive a net number of shares
   based on the fair market value of such shares at the time of exercise,
   after deducting the aggregate exercise price.

   Registration Rights

   We will pay the registration expenses (other than underwriting discount
   and stock transfer taxes) of the holders of the shares registered for
   sale pursuant to the registrations described below. In an underwritten
   offering, the managing underwriter, if any, has the right, subject to
   specified conditions, to limit the number of shares such holders may
   include. In connection with the completion of this offering,
   substantially all of our stockholders that have registration rights
   agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities without the
   prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan
   Securities LLC for a period of 180 days after the date of this
   prospectus, subject to certain terms and conditions and provided that
   if (1) at least 120 days have elapsed since the date of this
   prospectus, (2) we have publicly released our earnings results for the
   quarterly period during which this offering occurred and (3) such
   lock-up period is scheduled to end during or within five trading days
   prior to a blackout period, such lock-up period will end ten trading
   days prior to the commencement of such blackout period. See the section
   titled Underwriting for additional information.

   Following the completion of this offering, the holders of certain
   outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and the holders of
   shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon conversion of our
   redeemable convertible preferred stock, or their permitted transferees,
   will be entitled to rights with respect to the registration of these
   shares under the Securities Act. These shares are referred to as
   registrable securities. Immediately following this offering, there will
   be approximately                registrable securities outstanding.
   These rights are provided under the terms of our fourth amended and
   restated investors rights agreement between us and the holders of
   these shares, which was entered into in April 2019, and include
   requested registration rights, Form S-3 registration rights, and
   piggyback registration rights. In any registration made pursuant to
   such amended and restated investor rights agreement, all fees, costs,
   and expenses of underwritten registrations, including fees and
   disbursements of one special counsel to the selling stockholders, will
   be borne by us and all selling expenses, including the estimated
   underwriting discount, will be borne by the holders of the shares being
   registered. However, we will not be required to bear the expenses in
   connection with the exercise of the requested and Form S-3 registration
   rights of a registration if the request is subsequently withdrawn at
   the request of the selling stockholders holding a majority of
   registrable securities to be registered.

   The registration rights terminate upon the earlier of (1) five years
   following the completion of this offering or (2) as to any given holder
   of registration rights, at such time following this offering when such
   holder of registration rights (a) can sell all of such holders
   registrable securities in compliance with Rule 144(b)(1)(i) or
   (b) holds 1% or less of our outstanding common stock and all
   registrable securities held by such holder can be sold in any
   three-month period without registration pursuant to Rule 144 under the
   Securities Act and without the requirement for us to be in compliance
   with the current public information requirement under Rule 144(c)(1).

   Requested Registration Rights

   The holders of an aggregate of 210,640,629 shares of our Class B common
   stock following this offering, or their permitted transferees, are
   entitled to demand registration rights. Under the terms of the amended
   and restated investor rights agreement, if we receive a written
   request, at any time after the earlier of (1) August 30, 2025 or
   (2) six months following the effective date of this offering, from the
   holders of at least 50% of the registrable securities then outstanding
   that we file a


                                     136
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
   registration of outstanding registrable securities, then we will be
   required, within 20 days of receipt of the written request, to use
   commercially reasonable efforts to register, as soon as practicable,
   all of the shares requested to be registered for public resale, if the
   amount of registrable securities to be registered will have aggregate
   gross proceeds (before underwriting discount) of at least
   $20.0 million. We are required to effect only three registrations
   pursuant to this provision of the amended and restated investor rights
   agreement. We may postpone the filing of a registration statement no
   more than once during any 12-month period for up to 90 days if our
   board of directors determines that the filing would be detrimental to
   us and our stockholders. We are not required to effect a requested
   registration under certain additional circumstances specified in the
   amended and restated investor rights agreement.

   Form S-3 Registration Rights

   The holders of an aggregate of 210,640,629 shares of our Class B common
   stock following this offering or their permitted transferees are also
   entitled to Form S-3 registration rights. The holders of at least 30%
   of the registrable securities then outstanding can request that we
   register all or part of their shares on Form S-3 if we are eligible and
   qualified to file a registration statement on Form S-3 and if the
   aggregate price to the public of the shares offered is at least
   $5.0 million. The stockholders may require us to effect at most two
   registration statements on Form S-3 in any 12-month period. We may
   postpone the filing of a registration statement on Form S-3 no more
   than once during any 12-month period for up to 90 days if our board of
   directors determines that the filing would be detrimental to us and our
   stockholders. We are not required to effect a registration on Form S-3
   under certain additional circumstances specified in the amended and
   restated investor rights agreement.

   Piggyback Registration Rights

   If we register any of our securities for public sale, the holders of an
   aggregate of                 shares of our Class B common stock
   following this offering or their permitted transferees are entitled to
   piggyback registration rights. However, this right does not apply to a
   registration relating to sales of securities of participants in one of
   our stock plans, a registration relating to the offer and sale of debt
   securities or a registration relating to a corporate reorganization or
   other transaction under Rule 145 of the Securities Act. The
   underwriters of any underwritten offering will have the right, in their
   sole discretion, to limit, because of marketing reasons, the number of
   shares registered by these holders, in which case the number of shares
   to be registered will be apportioned, first, to us, and second, pro
   rata among these holders, according to the total amount of securities
   entitled to be included by each holder, subject to additional
   circumstances specified in the amended and restated investor rights
   agreement.

   Anti-Takeover Provisions

   The provisions of Delaware law, our restated certificate of
   incorporation and our restated bylaws, as we expect they will be in
   effect upon the completion of this offering, could have the effect of
   delaying, deferring, or discouraging another person from acquiring
   control of our company. These provisions, which are summarized below,
   may have the effect of discouraging takeover bids. They are also
   designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of
   us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the
   benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate
   with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages
   of discouraging a proposal to acquire us because negotiation of these
   proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.

   Delaware Law

   We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, regulating
   corporate takeovers. In general, DGCL Section 203 prohibits a publicly
   held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination
   with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following
   the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless:


     

   prior to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the
   corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction
   which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;


     

   the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of
   the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced,
   excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding, but
   not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder,
   (1) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and
   (2) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants
   do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held
   subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or


                                     137
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

     

   at or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business
   combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation
   and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not
   by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of
   the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested
   stockholder.

   Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock
   sale, or other transaction or series of transactions together resulting
   in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested
   stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates,
   owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested
   stockholder status, did own 15% or more of a corporations outstanding
   voting stock. We expect the existence of this provision to have an
   anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our board of
   directors does not approve in advance. We also anticipate that DGCL
   Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium
   over the market price for the shares of common stock held by
   stockholders.

   Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaw Provisions

   Our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws will
   include a number of provisions that could deter hostile takeovers or
   delay or prevent changes in control of our management team, including
   the following:


     

   Dual Class Common Stock. As described above in the section titled
   Common StockVoting Rights, our restated certificate of
   incorporation will provide for a dual class common stock structure
   pursuant to which holders of our Class B common stock will have the
   ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder
   approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the
   shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, including
   the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such
   as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. Current
   investors, executives, and employees will have the ability to exercise
   significant influence over those matters.


     

   Board of Directors Vacancies. Our restated certificate of incorporation
   and restated bylaws will authorize only our board of directors to fill
   vacant directorships, including newly created seats. In addition, the
   number of directors constituting our board of directors is permitted to
   be set only by a resolution adopted by a majority vote of our entire
   board of directors. These provisions would prevent a stockholder from
   increasing the size of our board of directors and then gaining control
   of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its
   own nominees. This makes it more difficult to change the composition of
   our board of directors but promotes continuity of management.


     

   Classified Board. Our restated certificate of incorporation and
   restated bylaws will provide that our board of directors will be
   classified into three classes of directors. The existence of a
   classified board of directors could discourage a third party from
   making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us
   as it is more difficult and time consuming for stockholders to replace
   a majority of the directors on a classified board of directors. See the
   section titled ManagementBoard of Directors Composition for
   additional information.


     

   Directors Removed Only for Cause. Our restated certificate of
   incorporation will provide that stockholders may remove directors only
   for cause.


     

   Supermajority Requirements for Amendments of Our Restated Certificate
   of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws. Our restated certificate of
   incorporation will further provide that the affirmative vote of holders
   of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all of the then
   outstanding shares of voting stock will be required to amend certain
   provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, including
   provisions relating to the classified board, the size of the board,
   removal of directors, special meetings, actions by written consent, and
   designation of our preferred stock. In addition, the affirmative vote
   of holders of 75% of the voting power of each of our Class A common
   stock and Class B common stock, voting separately by class, will be
   required to amend the provisions of our restated certificate of
   incorporation relating to the terms of our Class B common stock. The
   affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of
   all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock will be required to
   amend or repeal our restated bylaws, although our restated bylaws may
   be amended by a simple majority vote of our board of directors.


     

   Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders. Our restated
   certificate of incorporation provides that special meetings of our
   stockholders may be called only by a majority of our board of
   directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our lead independent
   director, or our chief executive officer. Our restated certificate of
   incorporation will provide that our stockholders may not take action by
   written consent, but may only take action at annual or special meetings
   of our stockholders. As a result, holders of our capital stock would
   not be able to amend our restated bylaws or remove directors without
   holding a meeting of our stockholders called in accordance with our
   restated bylaws. Further, our restated bylaws will provide that special
   meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of


                                     138
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents



   our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our
   lead independent director, or our chief executive officer, thus
   prohibiting a stockholder from calling a special meeting. These
   provisions might delay the ability of our stockholders to force
   consideration of a proposal or for stockholders to take any action,
   including the removal of directors.


     

   Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director
   Nominations. Our restated bylaws provide advance notice procedures for
   stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of
   stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our
   annual meeting of stockholders. Our restated bylaws also specify
   certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholders
   notice. These provisions might preclude our stockholders from bringing
   matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making
   nominations for directors at our annual meeting of stockholders if the
   proper procedures are not followed. We expect that these provisions
   might also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a
   solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirers own slate of directors
   or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.


     

   No Cumulative Voting. The DGCL provides that stockholders are not
   entitled to the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors
   unless a corporations certificate of incorporation provides otherwise.
   Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws will not
   provide for cumulative voting.


     

   Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock. After the filing of our
   restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors will have
   the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up
   to shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences,
   including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of
   directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred
   stock enables our board of directors to render more difficult or to
   discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger,
   tender offer, proxy contest, or other means.


     

   Choice of Forum. Our restated certificate of incorporation will provide
   that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of
   the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative
   action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a
   breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us
   arising pursuant to the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation
   or our restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that
   is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum
   provision will not apply to claims that are vested in the exclusive
   jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery of
   the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of Chancery of the State
   of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction. For instance,
   the provision would not preclude the filing of claims brought to
   enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or Securities
   Act or the rules and regulations thereunder in federal court.

                       SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE

   Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of
   our Class A common stock, and we cannot predict the effect, if any,
   that market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the
   availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have
   on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to
   time. Nevertheless, sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common
   stock, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock
   options in the public market following this offering could adversely
   affect market prices prevailing from time to time and could impair our
   ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities.

   Following the completion of this offering, based on the number of
   shares of our capital stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019, we will
   have a total of                shares of our Class A common stock
   outstanding and 235,942,233 shares of our Class B common stock
   outstanding. This includes                  shares that we are selling
   in this offering, which shares may be resold in the public market
   immediately following this offering, and assumes no additional exercise
   of outstanding options. Shares of our Class B common stock are
   convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common
   stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock
   upon transfer.

   The remaining outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and
   Class B common stock will be deemed restricted securities as defined
   in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may be sold
   in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities
   Act or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule
   144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act, which rules are summarized
   below. As a result of the lock-up agreements and market standoff
   provisions described below and subject to the provisions of Rule 144 or
   Rule 701, shares will be available for sale in the public market as
   follows:


     

   beginning on the date of this prospectus, all of the shares of Class A
   common stock sold in this offering will be immediately available for
   sale in the public market;


     

   beginning 181 days after the date of this
   prospectus,                additional shares of common stock will
   become eligible for sale in the public market, of
   which                shares will be held by affiliates and subject to
   the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below;
   provided that if (1) if at least 120 days have elapsed since the date
   of this prospectus, (2) we have publicly released our earnings results
   for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred, and (3)
   the lock-up period as described below is scheduled to end during or
   within five trading days prior a blackout period, beginning on the date
   that is ten trading days prior to the commencement of such blackout
   period, such additional shares shall become eligible for sale in the
   public market; and


     

   the remainder of the shares of common stock will be eligible for sale
   in the public market from time to time thereafter upon subject to
   vesting and, in some cases, to the volume and other restrictions of
   Rule 144, as described below.

   Lock-Up Agreements and Market Stand Off Provisions

   All of our directors, executive officers, and substantially all of the
   holders of our common stock, or securities exercisable for or
   convertible into our common stock outstanding immediately prior to this
   offering, are subject to lock-up agreements or market standoff
   provisions that, subject to exceptions described under the section
   titled Underwriting below, prohibit them from offering for sale,
   selling, contracting to sell, granting any option for the sale of,
   transferring or otherwise disposing of any shares of our common stock,
   stock options, or any security or instrument related to this common
   stock, or stock option for a period of at least 180 days following the
   date of this prospectus, without the prior written consent of Goldman
   Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC; provided that if (1) at
   least 120 days have elapsed since the date of this prospectus, (2) we
   have publicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period
   during which this offering occurred and (3) such lock-up period is
   scheduled to end during or within five trading days prior to a blackout
   period, such lock-up period will end ten trading days prior to the
   commencement of such blackout period. These agreements are subject to
   certain customary exceptions. See the section titled Underwriting for
   additional information.

   Rule 144

   In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, once we have been
   subject to the public company reporting requirements of Section 13 or
   Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act for at least 90 days, a person who is
   not deemed to have been one of our


                                     140
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   affiliates for purposes of the Securities Act at any time during the 90
   days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the shares
   proposed to be sold for at least six months, including the holding
   period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, is entitled to
   sell those shares without complying with the manner of sale, volume
   limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144, subject to compliance with
   the public information requirements of Rule 144 and the requirements of
   the lock-up and market standoff agreements, as described above. If such
   a person has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at
   least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other
   than our affiliates, then that person would be entitled to sell those
   shares (subject to the requirements of the lock-up and market standoff
   agreements, as described above) without complying with any of the
   requirements of Rule 144.

   In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, our affiliates or
   persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are entitled to sell
   upon expiration of the lock-up and market standoff provisions described
   above, within any three-month period, a number of shares that does not
   exceed the greater of:


     

   1% of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then
   outstanding, which will equal approximately shares immediately after
   this offering; or


     

   the average weekly trading volume of our Class A common stock during
   the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144
   with respect to that sale.

   Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling shares on
   behalf of our affiliates are also subject to certain manner of sale
   provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current
   public information about us.

   Rule 701

   Rule 701 generally allows a stockholder who purchased shares of our
   capital stock pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract and
   who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of our company during the
   immediately preceding 90 days to sell these shares in reliance upon
   Rule 144, but without being required to comply with the public
   information, holding period, volume limitation, or notice provisions of
   Rule 144. Rule 701 also permits affiliates of our company to sell their
   Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding
   period requirements of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares,
   however, are required by that rule to wait until 90 days after the date
   of this prospectus before selling those shares pursuant to Rule 701.
   Moreover, all Rule 701 shares are subject to lock-up agreements and or
   market standoff agreements as described above and under the section
   titled Underwriting and will not become eligible for sale until the
   expiration of those agreements.

   Registration Statements

   In connection with this offering, we intend to file one or more
   registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering
   all of the shares of our Class B common stock subject to outstanding
   stock options and the shares of our Class A common stock reserved for
   issuance under our equity incentive plans. We expect to file this
   registration statement as soon as permitted under the Securities Act.
   However, the shares registered on Form S-8 may be subject to the volume
   limitations and the manner of sale, notice, and public information
   requirements of Rule 144 and will not be eligible for resale until
   expiration of the lock-up and market standoff agreements to which they
   are subject.

   Registration Rights

   We have granted demand, Form S-3, and piggyback registration rights to
   certain of our stockholders to sell our common stock. Registration of
   the sale of these shares under the Securities Act would result in these
   shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the
   Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration,
   except for shares purchased by affiliates. See the section titled
   Description of Capital StockRegistration Rights for additional
   information.

    MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF
                          OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK

   The following summary describes the material U.S. federal income tax
   consequences of the ownership and disposition of our Class A common
   stock acquired in this offering by Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below).
   This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income
   taxes, does not discuss the potential application of the alternative
   minimum tax or the Medicare Contribution tax on net investment income,
   and does not deal with state or local taxes, U.S. federal gift, and
   estate tax laws, except to the limited extent provided below, or any
   non-U.S. tax consequences that may be relevant to Non-U.S. Holders in
   light of their particular circumstances.

   Special rules different from those described below may apply to certain
   Non-U.S. Holders that are subject to special treatment under the Code,
   such as:


     

   insurance companies, banks, and other financial institutions;


     

   tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations) and
   tax-qualified retirement plans;


     

   qualified foreign pension funds as defined in Section 897(l)(2) of
   the Code and entities all of the interests of which are held by
   qualified foreign pension funds;


     

   persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item
   of gross income with respect to our Class A common stock being taken
   into account in an applicable financial statement;


     

   non-U.S. governments and international organizations;


     

   broker-dealers and traders in securities;


     

   U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term residents of
   the United States;


     

   persons that own, or are deemed to own, more than five percent of our
   Class A common stock;


     

   controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment
   companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S.
   federal income tax;


     

   persons that hold our Class A common stock as part of a straddle,
   hedge, conversion transaction, synthetic security, or integrated
   investment or other risk reduction strategy;


     

   persons who do not hold our Class A common stock as a capital asset
   within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, for
   investment purposes); and


     

   partnerships and other pass-through entities, and investors in such
   pass-through entities (regardless of their places of organization or
   formation).

   Such Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to
   determine the U.S. federal, state, local, and other tax consequences
   that may be relevant to them.

   Furthermore, the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the
   Code, and Treasury regulations, rulings, and judicial decisions
   thereunder as of the date hereof, and such authorities may be repealed,
   revoked, or modified, possibly retroactively, and are subject to
   differing interpretations which could result in U.S. federal income tax
   consequences different from those discussed below. We have not
   requested a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, with
   respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the
   following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will
   agree with such statements and conclusions or will not take a contrary
   position regarding the tax consequences described herein, or that any
   such contrary position would not be sustained by a court.

   PERSONS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK PURSUANT
   TO THIS OFFERING SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE
   U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ACQUIRING, OWNING, AND
   DISPOSING OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR
   SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY
   OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION, INCLUDING ANY STATE, LOCAL, OR NON-U.S. TAX
   CONSEQUENCES OR ANY U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND THE
   POSSIBLE APPLICATION OF TAX TREATIES.

   For the purposes of this discussion, a Non-U.S. Holder is a
   beneficial owner of Class A common stock that is not a U.S. Holder or a
   partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder means
   a beneficial owner of our Class A


                                     142
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (1) an
   individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a
   corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal
   income tax purposes), created or organized in or under the laws of the
   United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (3) an
   estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation
   regardless of its source, or (4) a trust if it (i) is subject to the
   primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
   U.S. persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)
   have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or
   (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury
   regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

   If you are an individual non-U.S. citizen, you may, in some cases, be
   deemed to be a resident alien (as opposed to a nonresident alien) by
   virtue of being present in the United States for at least 31 days in
   the calendar year and for an aggregate of at least 183 days during a
   three-year period ending in the current calendar year. Generally, for
   this purpose, all the days present in the current year, one-third of
   the days present in the immediately preceding year, and one-sixth of
   the days present in the second preceding year, are counted.

   Resident aliens are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax as if
   they were U.S. citizens. Individuals who are uncertain of their status
   as resident or nonresident aliens for U.S. federal income tax purposes
   are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal
   income tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of our Class A
   common stock.

   Distributions

   We do not expect to make any distributions on our Class A common stock
   in the foreseeable future. If we do make distributions on our Class A
   common stock, however, such distributions made to a Non-U.S. Holder of
   our Class A common stock will constitute dividends for U.S. tax
   purposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings
   and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles).
   Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and
   profits will constitute a return of capital that is applied against and
   reduces, but not below zero, a Non-U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in
   our Class A common stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain
   realized on the sale or exchange of our Class A common stock as
   described below under Gain on Disposition of Our Class A Common
   Stock.

   Any distribution on our Class A common stock that is treated as a
   dividend paid to a Non-U.S. Holder that is not effectively connected
   with the holders conduct of a trade or business in the United States
   will generally be subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or such
   lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty
   between the United States and the Non-U.S. Holders country of
   residence. To obtain a reduced rate of withholding under a treaty, a
   Non-U.S. Holder generally will be required to provide the applicable
   withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form
   W-8BEN-E, or other appropriate form, certifying the Non-U.S. Holders
   entitlement to benefits under that treaty. Such form must be provided
   prior to the payment of dividends and must be updated periodically. If
   a Non-U.S. Holder holds stock through a financial institution or other
   agent acting on the holders behalf, the holder will be required to
   provide appropriate documentation to such agent. The holders agent
   will then be required to provide certification to the applicable
   withholding agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. If
   you are eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax under an
   income tax treaty, you should consult with your own tax advisor to
   determine if you are able to obtain a refund or credit of any excess
   amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for a refund
   with the IRS.

   We generally are not required to withhold tax on dividends paid to a
   Non-U.S. Holder that are effectively connected with the holders
   conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if
   required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a
   permanent establishment that the holder maintains in the United States)
   if a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI, stating that the dividends are
   so connected, is furnished to the applicable withholding agent. In
   general, such effectively connected dividends will be subject to U.S.
   federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated rates
   applicable to U.S. persons. A corporate Non-U.S. Holder receiving
   effectively connected dividends may also be subject to an additional
   branch profits tax, which is imposed, under certain circumstances, at
   a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable
   treaty) on the corporate Non-U.S. Holders effectively connected
   earnings and profits, subject to certain adjustments.

   See also the section below titled Foreign Accounts for additional
   withholding rules that may apply to dividends paid to certain foreign
   financial institutions or non-financial foreign entities.

   Gain on Disposition of Our Class A Common Stock

   Subject to the discussions below under the sections titled Backup
   Withholding and Information Reporting, a Non-U.S. Holder generally
   will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax with
   respect to gain realized on a sale or other


                                     143
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   disposition of our Class A common stock unless (1) the gain is
   effectively connected with a trade or business of the holder in the
   United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
   attributable to a permanent establishment that the holder maintains in
   the United States), (2) the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien
   individual and is present in the United States for 183 or more days in
   the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are
   met, or (3) we are or have been a United States real property holding
   corporation within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) at any time
   within the shorter of the five-year period preceding such disposition
   or the holders holding period in the Class A common stock.

   If you are a Non-U.S. Holder described in (1) above, you will be
   required to pay tax on the net gain derived from the sale at the
   regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to U.S.
   persons. Corporate Non-U.S. Holders described in (1) above may also be
   subject to the additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or such
   lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. If
   you are an individual Non-U.S. Holder described in (2) above, you will
   be required to pay a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale,
   which gain may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (even though you
   are not considered a resident of the United States), provided you have
   timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such
   losses. With respect to (3) above, in general, we would be a United
   States real property holding corporation if United States real property
   interests (as defined in the Code and the Treasury Regulations)
   comprised (by fair market value) at least half of our assets. We
   believe that we are not, and do not anticipate becoming, a United
   States real property holding corporation. However, there can be no
   assurance that we will not become a United States real property holding
   corporation in the future. Even if we are treated as a United States
   real property holding corporation, gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder
   on a disposition of our Class A common stock will not be subject to
   U.S. federal income tax so long as (1) the Non-U.S. Holder owned,
   directly, indirectly, or constructively, no more than five percent of
   our Class A common stock at all times within the shorter of (i) the
   five-year period preceding the disposition or (ii) the holders holding
   period and (2) our Class A common stock is regularly traded on an
   established securities market. There can be no assurance that our
   Class A common stock will qualify as regularly traded on an established
   securities market.

   U.S. Federal Estate Tax

   The estates of nonresident alien individuals generally are subject to
   U.S. federal estate tax on property with a U.S. situs. Because we are a
   U.S. corporation, our Class A common stock will be U.S. situs property
   and, therefore, will be included in the taxable estate of a nonresident
   alien decedent, unless an applicable estate tax treaty between the
   United States and the decedents country of residence provides
   otherwise. The terms resident and nonresident are defined
   differently for U.S. federal estate tax purposes than for U.S. federal
   income tax purposes. Investors are urged to consult their own tax
   advisors regarding the U.S. federal estate tax consequences of the
   ownership or disposition of our Class A common stock.

   Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

   Generally, we or certain financial middlemen must report information to
   the IRS with respect to any dividends we pay on our Class A common
   stock, including the amount of any such dividends, the name and address
   of the recipient, and the amount, if any, of tax withheld. A similar
   report is sent to the holder to whom any such dividends are paid.
   Pursuant to tax treaties or certain other agreements, the IRS may make
   its reports available to tax authorities in the recipients country of
   residence.

   Dividends paid by us (or our paying agents) to a Non-U.S. Holder may
   also be subject to U.S. backup withholding. U.S. backup withholding
   generally will not apply to a Non-U.S. Holder who provides a properly
   executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or
   otherwise establishes an exemption, provided that the applicable
   withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know the
   holder is a U.S. person.

   Under current U.S. federal income tax law, U.S. information reporting
   and backup withholding requirements generally will apply to the
   proceeds of a disposition of our Class A common stock effected by or
   through a U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or non-U.S., unless the
   Non-U.S. Holder provides a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS
   Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or otherwise meets documentary evidence
   requirements for establishing non-U.S. person status or otherwise
   establishes an exemption. Generally, U.S. information reporting and
   backup withholding requirements will not apply to a payment of
   disposition proceeds to a Non-U.S. Holder where the transaction is
   effected outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a
   non-U.S. broker. Information reporting and backup withholding
   requirements may, however, apply to a payment of disposition proceeds
   if the broker has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the holder
   is, in fact, a U.S. person. For information reporting purposes only,
   certain U.S. related brokers may be treated in a manner similar to U.S.
   brokers.

   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   Backup withholding is not an additional tax. If backup withholding is
   applied to you, you should consult with your own tax advisor to
   determine whether you have overpaid your U.S. federal income tax, and
   whether you are able to obtain a tax refund or credit of the overpaid
   amount.

   Foreign Accounts

   In addition, U.S. federal withholding taxes may apply under the Foreign
   Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, on certain types of payments,
   including dividends on our Class A common stock, made to non-U.S.
   financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities.
   Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on our
   Class A common stock paid to a foreign financial institution or a
   non-financial foreign entity (each as defined in the Code), unless
   (1) the foreign financial institution agrees to undertake certain
   diligence and reporting obligations, (2) the non-financial foreign
   entity either certifies it does not have any substantial United States
   owners (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information
   regarding each substantial United States owner, or (3) the foreign
   financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise
   qualifies for an exemption from these rules. The 30% federal
   withholding tax described in this paragraph cannot be reduced under an
   income tax treaty with the United States. If the payee is a foreign
   financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting
   requirements in (1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the
   U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it
   undertake to identify accounts held by certain specified United States
   persons or United States-owned foreign entities (each as defined in
   the Code), annually report certain information about such accounts, and
   withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial
   institutions and certain other account holders. Foreign financial
   institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental
   agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to
   different rules. Under the applicable Treasury Regulations and
   administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to
   payments of dividends on our common stock, and will apply to payments
   of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such stock on
   or after January 1, 2019, although under recently proposed regulations
   (the preamble to which specifies that taxpayers are permitted to rely
   on such proposed regulations pending finalization), no withholding
   would apply with respect to payments of gross proceeds.

   Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the
   potential application of withholding under FATCA to their investment in
   our Class A common stock.

   EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING
   THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING, HOLDING, AND DISPOSING OF OUR CLASS
   A COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGE IN
   APPLICABLE LAW, AS WELL AS TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE,
   LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS SUCH AS ESTATE AND
   GIFT TAX.

   The underwriters will commit to take and pay for all of the shares

   The underwriters have an option to buy up to an

   offering to cover sales by the underwriters of a greater number of
   shares than the total number set forth in the table above. They may
   exercise that option for 30 days. If any shares are purchased pursuant
   to this option, the underwriters will severally purchase shares in
   approximately the same proportion as set forth in the table above.

   A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the web
   sites maintained by one or more underwriters, or selling group members,
   if any, participating in the initial public offering. The underwriters
   may agree to allocate a number of shares to underwriters and selling
   group members for sale to their online brokerage account holders.
   Internet distributions will be allocated by the representatives to
   underwriters and selling group members that may make internet
   distributions on the same basis as other allocations.

   Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered
   at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover of this
   prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers
   may be sold at a discount of up to $                per share from the
   initial public offering price. After the initial offering of the
   shares, the representatives may change the offering price and the other
   selling terms. Sales of shares made outside of the United States may be
   made by affiliates of the underwriters. The offering of the shares by
   the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to
   the underwriters right to reject any order in whole or in part.

   We and our executive officers, directors, and holders of substantially
   all of our common stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable
   for our common stock have agreed or will agree with the underwriters,
   subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of our or
   their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
   shares of common stock during the period from the date of this
   prospectus continuing through the date 180 days after the date of this
   prospectus, except with the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs &
   Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC; provided that if (1) at least
   120 days have elapsed since the date of this prospectus, (2) we have
   publicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period during
   which this offering occurred, and (3) such lock-up period is scheduled
   to end during or within five trading days prior to a blackout period,
   such lock-up period will end ten trading days prior to the commencement
   of such blackout period. We will announce the date of any expected
   blackout-related release to the lock-up at least two trading days in
   advance of such release. This agreement does not apply to any existing
   employee benefit plans. See the section titled Shares Eligible for
   Future Sale for a discussion of certain transfer restrictions.

   Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares
   of our Class A common stock. The initial public offering price has been
   negotiated between the representatives and us. Among the factors to be
   considered in determining the initial public offering price of the
   shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be our
   historical performance, estimates of our business potential and
   earnings prospects of the company, an assessment of our management and
   the consideration of the above factors in relation to market valuation
   of companies in related businesses. Neither we nor the underwriters can
   assure investors that an active trading market will develop for our
   Class A common stock or that the shares will trade in the public market
   at or above the initial public offering price.

   We have applied to list our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global
   Select Market under the symbol PTON.

   In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell
   shares of Class A common stock in the open market. These transactions
   may include short sales, stabilizing transactions, and purchases to
   cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by
   the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required
   to purchase in the offering, and a short position represents the amount
   of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A
   covered short position is a short position that is not greater than
   the amount of additional shares for which the underwriters option
   described above may be exercised. The underwriters may cover any
   covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase
   additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In


                                     147
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   determining the source of shares to cover the covered short position,
   the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares
   available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at
   which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option
   described above. Naked short sales are any short sales that create a
   short position greater than the amount of additional shares for which
   the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must
   cover any such naked short position by purchasing shares in the open
   market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the
   underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the
   price of the Class A common stock in the open market after pricing that
   could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.
   Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of
   Class A common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior
   to the completion of the offering.

   The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a
   particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the
   underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have
   repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in
   stabilizing or short covering transactions.

   Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as
   well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may
   have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market
   price of our stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty
   bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of
   our Class A common stock. As a result, the price of our Class A common
   stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the
   open market. The underwriters are not required to engage in these
   activities and may end any of these activities at any time. These
   transactions may be effected on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, in the
   over-the-counter market or otherwise.

   We estimate that our share of the total expenses of the offering,
   excluding underwriting discount, will be approximately
   $                 . We have agreed to reimburse the underwriters for
   certain expenses incurred by them in connection with this offering.

   We have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain
   liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

   Other than in the United States, no action has been taken by us or the
   underwriters that would permit a public offering of the securities
   offered by this prospectus in any jurisdiction where action for that
   purpose is required. The securities offered by this prospectus may not
   be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this prospectus or
   any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the
   offer and sale of any such securities be distributed or published in
   any jurisdiction, except under circumstances that will result in
   compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of that
   jurisdiction. Persons into whose possession this prospectus comes are
   advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions
   relating to the offering and the distribution of this prospectus. This
   prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an
   offer to buy any securities offered by this prospectus in any
   jurisdiction in which such an offer or a solicitation is unlawful.

   The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service
   financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include
   sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory,
   investment management, investment research, principal investment,
   hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial
   activities and services. Certain of the underwriters and their
   respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a
   variety of these services to us and to persons and entities with
   relationships with us, for which they received or will receive
   customary fees and expenses.

   In June 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase
   Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and Bank of America, N.A.,
   Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, and Silicon
   Valley Bank, as joint syndication agents, which amended and restated
   the loan and security agreement that we previously entered into in
   November 2017. The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million
   secured revolving credit facility, including up to the lesser of
   $150.0 million and the aggregate unused amount of the facility for the
   issuance of letters of credit. The principal amount, if any, is payable
   in full in June 2024. As of June 30, 2019, we had not drawn on the
   credit facility and did not have outstanding borrowings under the
   Credit Agreement. See the section titled Managements Discussion and
   Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and
   Capital Resources for additional information.

   In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the
   underwriters and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, and
   employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and
   actively trade securities, derivatives, loans,

   customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or
   relate to assets, securities, or instruments of the issuer (directly,
   as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) or persons and
   entities with relationships with the issuer. The underwriters and their
   respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment
   recommendations, market color or trading ideas or publish or express
   independent research views in respect of such assets, securities, or
   instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they
   should acquire, long or short positions in such assets, securities, and
   instruments.

                  WHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   the Securities Act with respect to the shares of our Class A common
   stock offered hereby. This prospectus, which constitutes a part of the
   registration statement, does not contain all of the information set
   forth in the registration statement or the exhibits filed therewith.
   For further information about us and the Class A common stock offered
   hereby, reference is made to the registration statement and the

   regarding the contents of any contract or any other document that is

           Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

   To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Peloton Interactive,
   Inc.

   Opinion on the Financial Statements

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Peloton
   Interactive, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the
   related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss,
   cash flows and changes in redeemable convertible preferred stock and
   stockholders deficit for each of the three years in the period ended
   June 30, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
   consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated
   financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
   financial position of the Company at June 30, 2018 and 2019, and the
   results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
   years in the period ended June 30, 2019, in conformity with U.S.
   generally accepted accounting principles.

   Basis for Opinion

   These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
   management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
   Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
   accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
   Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
   respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
   laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
   Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
   Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
   reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
   material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is
   not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
   internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are
   required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
   reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
   effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
   reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

   Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
   material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
   or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
   procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
   amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
   included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
   estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
   presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
   provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

   We have served as the Companys auditor since 2017.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation

   Description and Organization

   Peloton Interactive, Inc. (Peloton or the Company) is the largest
   interactive fitness platform in the world with a loyal community of
   Members, which we define as any individual who has a Peloton account.
   The Company pioneered connected, technology-enabled fitness and the
   streaming of immersive, instructor-led boutique classes to its Members
   anytime, anywhere. The Company makes fitness entertaining,
   approachable, effective, and convenient while fostering social
   connections that encourage its Members to be the best versions of
   themselves.

   The Company markets and sells its interactive fitness products
   (Connected Fitness Products) directly through its retail showrooms
   and at www.onepeloton.com. The Company was founded in 2012 and
   incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015. As of June 30, 2019, the
   Company had established wholly owned subsidiaries in the United States,
   the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany and its corporate headquarters
   is in New York, New York.

   The Company organizes its business into the following three reportable
   segments: Connected Fitness Products, Subscription and Other. See Note
   17, Segment Information, for further discussion of the Companys
   segment reporting structure.

   Basis of Presentation

   The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
   accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

   Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included
   elsewhere in these financial statements have been subject to rounding
   adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may
   not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and
   figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as
   applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of
   the percentages that precede them.

   Basis of Consolidation

   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Peloton
   Interactive, Inc. and its subsidiaries in which the Company has a
   controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances
   and transactions have been eliminated.

   Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet Information

   The unaudited pro forma balance sheet information as of June 30, 2019
   presents the Companys stockholders deficit as though all of the
   Companys redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding had
   automatically converted into an aggregate of 210,640,629 shares of the
   Companys common stock, upon the completion of a qualifying initial
   public offering (IPO) of the Companys common stock. The shares of
   common stock issuable and the proceeds expected to be received by the
   Company upon the completion of a qualifying IPO are excluded from such
   pro forma financial information.

   2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   Cash and Cash Equivalents

   The Company considers all cash and short-term investments purchased
   with maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash
   equivalents. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Companys cash and cash
   equivalents were substantially held in money market and operating
   accounts. At various times during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018
   and 2019, the balances of cash at financial institutions exceeded the
   federally insured limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in
   such accounts and believes cash and cash equivalents are not subject to
   any significant credit risk.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   Restricted Cash

   Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held in reserve accounts
   related to operating lease obligations.

   Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowances

   The Companys accounts receivable primarily represent amounts due from
   third-party sales processors. On a periodic basis, the Company
   evaluates accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible, which to
   date have not been material, and provides allowances, as necessary, for
   doubtful accounts.

   Revenue Recognition

   Adoption of Topic 606

   On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 and all subsequent
   amendments. The Company elected to apply the standard and all related
   ASUs retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. The
   adoption of the new standard had no material impact on the measurement
   or recognition of revenue, resulting in no adjustments to the prior
   periods. Additional disclosures, however, have been added in accordance
   with ASU 2014-09. Refer to Note 3, Revenue.

   Shipping and Delivery Fees

   The Company accounts for shipping, delivery and installation fees, net
   of discounts and refunds, billed to customers as revenue.

   Sales Taxes

   Sales tax collected from customers and remitted to governmental
   authorities is not included in revenue and is reflected as a liability
   on the balance sheet.

   Inventories

   Inventories consist of finished goods, which are generally purchased
   from contract manufacturers. Connected Fitness Product, accessories,
   and apparel inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a
   weighted-average cost basis. The Company assesses the valuation of
   inventory and periodically adjusts the value for estimated excess and
   obsolete inventory based upon estimates of future demand and market
   conditions, as well as damaged or otherwise impaired goods. Spare parts
   are recorded as inventory and recognized in cost of goods sold as
   consumed.

   Marketable Securities

   The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as
   available-for-sale and, accordingly, records them at fair value.
   Marketable securities with original maturities of greater than three
   months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as
   current investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be
   classified as current based on their highly liquid nature and because
   such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is
   available for current operations. Unrealized holding gains and losses,
   which are immaterial, are excluded from earnings and are reported net
   of tax in other comprehensive income until realized. Dividend and
   interest income is recognized when earned. Realized gains and losses,
   are included in earnings and are derived using the specific
   identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.

   Property and Equipment

   Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
   depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated
   using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
   assets. For leasehold improvements, the useful life is the lesser of
   the applicable lease term or the expected asset life. Charges for
   repairs and maintenance that do

   not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed
   as incurred. The Company capitalizes the cost of pre-production tooling
   which it owns during a supply arrangement. Pre-production tooling and
   engineering costs the Company will not own or will not be used in
   producing products under long-term supply arrangements are expensed as
   incurred.

   Internal-Use Software

   The Company capitalizes certain qualified costs incurred in connection
   with the development of internal-use software. The Company evaluates
   the costs incurred during the application development stage of internal
   use software and website development to determine whether the costs
   meet the criteria for capitalization. Costs related to preliminary
   project activities and post implementation activities including
   maintenance are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs related to
   internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
   estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed three years.
   Capitalized costs less accumulated amortization are included within
   property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.

   Goodwill and Intangible Assets

   Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration
   transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest, if
   any, over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and
   liabilities assumed in a business combination. The Company has no
   intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

   Intangible assets other than goodwill are comprised of acquired
   developed technology. At initial recognition, intangible assets
   acquired in a business combination are recognized at their fair value
   as of the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition,
   intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and
   impairment losses, if any, and are amortized on a straight-line basis
   over the estimated useful life of the asset.

   The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events
   or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. In
   conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first reviews
   qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not
   that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
   amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit
   is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative
   assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by
   analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows. If the
   carrying value of the reporting unit continues to exceed its fair
   value, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is
   calculated and an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded. The
   Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of
   each fiscal year.

   The Company assesses the impairment of intangible assets whenever
   events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
   may not be recoverable.

   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

   Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
   changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
   may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is
   measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future
   undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
   the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted net
   future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by
   which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds fair value.

   Cost of Revenue

   Connected Fitness Products

   Cost of revenue consists of product costs, including manufacturing
   costs, duties and other applicable importing costs, shipping and
   handling costs, packaging, warranty replacement costs, fulfillment
   costs, warehousing costs, and certain allocated costs related to
   management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses associated with
   supply chain logistics.

   Subscription

   Subscription cost of revenue includes costs associated with content
   creation and cost to stream content to our Members across the Companys
   platform. These costs consist of both fixed costs, including studio
   rent and occupancy, other studio overhead and instructor and production
   personnel costs, and variable costs, including music royalty fees,
   content costs for past use, third-party platform streaming costs, and
   payment processing fees for our monthly subscription billings.

   Music Royalty Fees

   The Company recognizes music royalty fees on all music it streams to
   Members as these fees are incurred in accordance with the terms of the
   relevant license agreement with the music rights holder. The incurrence
   of the royalties is primarily driven by content usage by the Companys
   Members on a fee-per-play basis through the use of the Companys
   Subscriptions and classified within subscription cost of revenue within
   the Companys statement of operations. The Companys license agreements
   with music rights holders generally include provisions for advance
   royalties as well as minimum guarantees. When a minimum guarantee is
   paid in advance, the guarantee is recorded as a prepaid expense and
   amortized to subscription cost of revenue.

   As the Company executes music license agreements with various music
   rights holders for go-forward usage, the Company may also
   simultaneously enter into a settlement agreement whereby the Company is
   released from all potential licensor claims regarding the Companys
   alleged past use of copyrighted material in exchange for a negotiated
   payment. These are referred to as content costs for past use and are
   recorded within subscription cost of revenue. The Company has entered
   into agreements with music rights holders who represent all the music
   catalogs that the Company needs to operate its service, however, given
   the uncertain and opaque nature of music rights ownership, the
   Companys archived library may continue to include music for which
   certain rights or fractional interests have not been accurately
   determined or fully licensed. Prior to the execution of a music license
   agreement, the Company estimates and records a charge based upon
   license agreements previously entered into and the market share and
   size of the music rights holder.

   Income Taxes

   The Company utilizes the asset and liability method for computing its
   income tax provision. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the
   expected future consequences of temporary differences between the
   financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as
   operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards, using
   enacted tax rates. Management makes estimates, assumptions, and
   judgments to determine the Companys provision for income taxes,
   deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance
   recorded against deferred tax assets. The Company assesses the
   likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future
   taxable income and, to the extent the Company believes recovery is not
   likely, establishes a valuation allowance.

   The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
   only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained
   on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits
   of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are
   then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
   likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties
   related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been
   material, are recognized within income tax expense.

   Research and Development Costs

   Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel- and
   facilities-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses,
   tooling and prototype materials and software platform expenses.
   Substantially all of the Companys research and development expenses
   are related to developing new products and services and improving
   existing products and services. Research and development expenses are
   expensed as incurred. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018,
   and 2019, research and development costs were $13.0 million,
   $23.4 million, $54.8 million, respectively.

   Stock-Based Compensation

   Stock-based awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair
   value of the award and are recognized as expense, net of actual
   forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
   period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.
   For performance-based options issued, the value of the instrument is
   measured at the grant date as the fair value of the award and expensed
   over the vesting term under an accelerated attribution method when the
   performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. The
   Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the
   Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of the grant date
   fair value of stock awards issued is affected by a number of variables,
   including the fair value of the Companys common stock, the expected
   common stock price volatility over the expected life of the options,
   the expected term of the stock option, risk-free interest rates, and
   the expected dividend yield of the Companys common stock. The Company
   derives its volatility from the average historical stock volatilities
   of several peer public companies over a period equivalent to the
   expected term of the awards. The Company estimates the expected term
   based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to
   be plain vanilla options, as the Companys historical share option
   exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to
   estimate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the
   United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
   Expected dividend yield is 0.0% as the Company has not paid and does
   not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock.

   Generally, the Companys stock options plans permit early exercise. The
   unvested portion of shares exercised is recorded as a liability on the
   Companys balance sheet and reclassified to equity as vesting occurs.

   Common Stock Valuations

   The Company has historically granted stock options at exercise prices
   equal to the fair value as determined by the Companys Board of
   Directors (Board of Directors) on the date of grant. In the absence
   of a public trading market, the Board of Directors, with input from
   management, exercises significant judgment and consider numerous
   objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of the
   Companys common stock as of the date of each stock option grant,
   including:


     

   relevant precedent transactions involving the Companys capital stock;


     

   the liquidation preferences, rights, preferences, and privileges of the
   Companys redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to the common
   stock;


     

   the Companys actual operating and financial performance;


     

   current business conditions and projections;


     

   the Companys stage of development;


     

   the likelihood and timing of achieving a liquidity event for the shares
   of common stock underlying the stock options, such as an initial public
   offering, given prevailing market conditions;


     

   any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability of the
   common stock underlying the granted options;


     

   recent secondary stock sales and tender offers;


     

   the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and


     

   U.S. and global capital market conditions.

   In addition, the Board of Directors considers the independent
   valuations completed by a third-party valuation consultant. The
   valuations of the Companys common stock are determined in accordance
   with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified
   Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company
   Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.

   Share Repurchases

   Shares of the Companys common and preferred stock may be repurchased
   from time to time as authorized by the Board of Directors. Share
   repurchases are funded from existing cash balances, and repurchased
   shares are retired and returned to


                                    F-12

   unissued authorized shares. These repurchases are accounted for as
   reductions to the Companys common and preferred stock to the extent
   available with remaining amounts allocated against retained earnings.

   Use of Estimates

   The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to
   make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
   assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosures. On
   an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, among
   others, those related to income taxes, the realizability of inventory,
   stock-based compensation, contingencies, revenue-related reserves,
   content costs for past use reserve, fair value measurements, useful
   lives of property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets,
   and impairment of goodwill, intangible, and long-lived assets. The
   Company bases its estimates on historical experience, market
   conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
   reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

   Commitments and Contingencies

   Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments,
   litigation, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it
   is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
   assessment can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is reasonably
   possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, the
   Company discloses the possible loss or states that such an estimate
   cannot be made.

   Fair Value of Financial Instruments

   Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
   paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
   advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
   transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
   Subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and
   liabilities are recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income
   when they occur. When determining the fair value measurements for
   assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value,
   the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in
   which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurement
   or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets
   or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and
   credit risk.

   The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which
   prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and
   bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of
   input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:


     

   Level 1 inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for
   identical assets or liabilities.


     

   Level 2 inputs are based on observable inputs other than Level 1
   prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted
   prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions
   (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all
   significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or
   corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term
   of the assets or liabilities.


     

   Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation
   methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of
   assets or liabilities, and typically reflect managements estimates of
   assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
   liability.

   The Companys material financial instruments consist primarily of cash
   and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable,
   accounts payable, and accrued expenses. The carrying values of the
   Companys accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses
   approximated their fair values at June 30, 2018 and 2019, due to the
   short period of time to maturity or repayment.

   Earnings (Loss) Per Share

   The Company computes net income (loss) per share using the two-class
   method required for participating securities. The two-class method
   requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be
   allocated between common


                                    F-13

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights
   to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been
   distributed. The Companys redeemable convertible preferred stock and
   common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are
   participating securities. The Company considers any shares issued upon
   early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be
   participating securities because holders of such shares have
   non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a cash dividend is
   declared on common stock. These participating securities do not
   contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the
   Companys losses. As such, net losses for the periods presented were
   not allocated to the Companys participating securities.

   Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average
   number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted
   earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number
   of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential
   shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potential shares
   of common stock consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed
   exercise of stock options and warrants as well as the redeemable
   convertible preferred shares. During the fiscal years ended June 30,
   2017 and 2019, the excess of the repurchase price of preferred stock
   over its carrying value (see Note 12) has been recorded as an increase
   to net loss to determine net loss attributable to common stockholders.

   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

   Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

   ASU 2014-09

   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
   Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
   Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 replaces most existing revenue
   recognition guidance, and requires companies to recognize revenue based
   upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers
   in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
   expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In
   addition, the standard requires disclosures related to the nature,
   timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
   contracts with customers. The Company applied the five-step method
   outlined in ASU 2014-09 to all revenue streams and elected the full
   retrospective method for its adoption of the standard as of July 1,
   2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on
   the Companys consolidated financial statements. The additional
   disclosures required by ASU 2014-09 are included in Note 3, Revenue.

   ASU 2016-09

   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee
   Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects
   of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the
   income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
   liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The
   standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods,
   and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
   December 15, 2016. For all other entities, including emerging growth
   companies, the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after
   December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning
   after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in
   any interim or annual period. The Company early adopted ASU 2016-09 as
   of July 1, 2017. With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company accounts
   for forfeitures as they occur. The Company applied the guidance on a
   modified retrospective basis, which resulted in a $0.5 million
   cumulative effect adjustment and increase to accumulated deficit as of
   July 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2018 did not have a
   material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

   ASU 2017-01

   In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations
   (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The standard
   provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether
   transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or
   businesses. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets
   acquired is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets,
   the assets acquired are not considered a business. For public entities,
   this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
   December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting
   period. For all other entities, including emerging growth companies,
   this standard is effective for annual reporting periods

   beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within annual
   periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted ASU
   2017-01 as of July 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have
   a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

   ASU 2017-09

   In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock
   Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, to provide
   clarity and reduce both diversity in practice and cost complexity when
   applying the guidance in Topic 718 to a change to the terms and
   conditions of a stock-based payment award. ASU 2017-09 also provides
   guidance about the types of changes to the terms or conditions of a
   share-based payment award that require an entity to apply modification
   accounting in accordance with Topic 718. The standard is effective for
   annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim
   periods therein. The Company adopted this update as of July 1, 2018.
   The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
   Companys consolidated financial statements.

   ASU 2018-15

   In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customers Accounting for
   Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is
   a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 requires implementation costs incurred
   by customers in cloud computing arrangements to be deferred over the
   noncancelable term of the cloud-computing arrangements plus any
   optional renewal periods (1) that are reasonably certain to be
   exercised by the customer or (2) for which exercise of the renewal
   option is controlled by the cloud service provider. The effective date
   of this pronouncement for public entities is for fiscal years beginning
   after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
   For all other entities, including emerging growth companies, the
   standard is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2020, and
   interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15,
   2021. Early adoption is permitted. The standard can be adopted either
   using the prospective or retrospective transition approach. The Company
   early adopted ASU 2018-15 using the prospective approach as of January
   1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact
   on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

   Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

   ASU 2016-02

   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02
   requires a lessee to separate the lease components from the non-lease
   components in a contract and recognize in the statement of financial
   position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a
   right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset
   for the lease term. For public entities, this standard is effective for
   annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including
   interim periods within that reporting period. For all other entities,
   including emerging growth companies, this standard is effective for
   annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim
   periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The
   Company early adopted ASU 2016-02 using the modified retrospective
   approach as of July 1, 2019. Based upon the Companys lease portfolio
   and evaluation of the standard, the Company estimates the adoption will
   result in the addition of $400 million to $500 million of
   right-of-use-assets and liabilities to the consolidated balance sheet,
   with no significant change to the consolidated statements of operations
   or cash flows. Additionally, the Company estimates an approximate $147
   million decrease in assets and liabilities due to the de-recognition of
   the build-to-suit asset and liability.

   ASU 2017-04

   In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and
   Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the
   subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the
   goodwill impairment test. The standard is effective for public entities
   for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in annual reporting
   years beginning after December 15, 2019. For all other entities,
   including emerging growth companies, the standard is effective for
   annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in annual reporting
   years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption of this
   standard is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of
   ASU 2017-04 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
   statements.

   3. Revenue

   The Companys primary source of revenue is from sales of its Connected
   Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue.

   The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:


     

   identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer


     

   identification of the performance obligations in the contract


     

   determination of the transaction price


     

   allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in
   the contract


     

   recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance
   obligation

   Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is
   transferred to the Companys customers, in an amount that reflects the
   consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for
   those goods or services. The Companys revenue is reported net of sales
   returns and discounts, which to date have not been material to the
   Companys financial statements. The Company estimates its liability for
   product returns based on historical return trends by product category
   and seasonality and an evaluation of current economic and market
   conditions and records the expected customer refund liability as a
   reduction to revenue, and the expected inventory right of recovery as a
   reduction of cost of revenue. If actual return costs differ from
   previous estimates, the amount of the liability and corresponding
   revenue are adjusted in the period in which such costs occur.

   Some of the Companys contracts with customers contain multiple
   performance obligations. For customer contracts that include multiple
   performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual
   performance obligations if they are distinct. The transaction price is
   then allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone
   selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling
   price based on prices charged to customers.

   Connected Fitness Products

   Connected Fitness Products include the Companys Bike and Tread,
   related accessories, associated fees for delivery and installation, and
   extended warranty agreements. The Company recognizes Connected Fitness
   Product revenue net of sales returns and discounts when the product has
   been delivered to the customer. The Company generally allows customers
   to return products within thirty days of purchase, as stated in its
   return policy.

   The Company records fees paid to third-party financing partners in
   connection with its consumer financing program as a reduction of
   revenue, as it considers such costs to be a customer sales incentive.
   The Company records payment processing fees for its credit card sales
   for Connected Fitness Products within selling and marketing expenses.

   Subscription

   The Companys subscriptions provide unlimited access to content in its
   library of live and on-demand fitness classes. The Companys
   subscriptions are offered on a month-to-month basis.

   Historically, the Company offered a prepaid subscription option where
   Subscribers earned one free month or three free months of subscription
   with the purchase of a 12-month subscription or 24-month subscription,
   respectively. The Company also offered Subscribers the ability to
   finance the prepaid subscription with the purchase of a Connected
   Fitness Product as part of its financing program. The associated
   financing fees were paid to the Companys third-party partner at the
   outset of the arrangement and are recorded as a reduction to
   subscription revenue. The Company terminated both programs in July
   2018.

   Amounts paid for subscription fees are included within customer
   deposits and deferred revenue and recognized ratably on a
   month-to-month basis.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   The Company generates a small portion of its revenue from the sale of
   studio credits to attend and participate in a live, instructor-led
   class at its New York City studios. Studio revenue is recognized at the
   time the credits are redeemed and used.

   Product Warranty

   The Company offers a standard product warranty that its Connected
   Fitness Products will operate under normal, non-commercial use for a
   period of one-year from the date of original delivery. The Company has
   the obligation, at its option, to either repair or replace the
   defective product. At the time revenue is recognized, an estimate of
   future warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenue.
   Factors that affect the warranty obligation include historical as well
   as current product failure rates, service delivery costs incurred in
   correcting product failures, and warranty policies. The Companys
   products are manufactured by contract manufacturers, and in certain
   cases, the Company may have recourse to such contract manufacturers.

   The Company also offers the option for customers in some markets to
   purchase a third-party extended warranty and service contract that
   extends or enhances the technical support, parts, and labor coverage
   offered as part of the base warranty included with the Connected
   Fitness Product for an additional period of 12 to 27 months.

   Revenue and related fees paid to the third-party provider are
   recognized on a gross basis as the Company has a continuing obligation
   to perform over the service period. Extended warranty revenue is
   recognized ratably over the extended warranty coverage period and is
   included in Connected Fitness Products revenue in the consolidated
   statement of operations.

   subscription fees billed that have not been recognized. Customer
   deposits represent payments received in advance before the Company
   transfers a good or service to the customer and are refundable.

   6. Acquisition

   Neurotic Media Acquisition

   On June 6, 2018, the Company acquired Neurotic Media, LLC (Neurotic),
   a Georgia limited liability company, for a purchase price of
   approximately $28.8 million net of cash acquired, which was paid in
   cash. Upon completion of the merger agreement, Neurotic became a wholly
   owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company acquired Neurotic
   primarily to automate and streamline content rights management on its
   platform, and to enhance Member engagement through new music features.
   The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. Of the
   total purchase consideration, $4.3 million has been recorded to
   goodwill, $24.8 million to acquired developed technology, and
   $0.1 million to tangible net assets. Included within the purchase price
   and goodwill is $0.1 million in working capital adjustments identified
   during the measurement period subsequent to the acquisition.

   The goodwill of $4.3 million represents the future economic benefits
   expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not
   qualify for separate recognition, including an experienced workforce
   and expected future synergies. The Company allocated the goodwill to
   its Subscription reporting segment.

   The results of operations for the acquisition have been included in the
   consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date.
   Actual and pro forma revenue and results of operations for the
   acquisition have not been presented because they do not have a material
   impact to the Companys consolidated revenue and results of operations,
   either individually or in aggregate.

   In November 2018, the Company entered into a lease agreement for office
   space for its new corporate headquarters. As a result of the Companys
   involvement during the construction period, whereby the Company had
   certain indemnification obligations related to the construction, the
   Company is considered, for accounting purposes only, the owner of the
   construction project under build-to-suit lease accounting. Accordingly,
   the Company recorded the estimated fair value of the leased space as an
   asset, noted in the table above as Building-build-to-suit asset. The
   Company also recorded a corresponding long-term lease liability. Refer

   10. Debt and Financing Arrangements

   2015 Debt Financing Facility

   In June 2015, the Company entered into a $3.0 million senior secured
   term loan facility (as amended from time to time, the Term Loan
   Agreement) with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), maturing on June 1, 2019.
   The term loan was repayable in 36 scheduled installments commencing on
   July 1, 2016. Principal outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement
   accrued interest, payable monthly, at a floating rate per annum equal
   to the prime rate plus 1.50%.

   In June 2015, the Company entered into a three-year, $32.0 million
   secured revolving credit facility with SVB (as amended from time to
   time, the 2015 Credit Agreement). The amount that could be borrowed
   under the 2015 Credit Agreement was based upon a borrowing base formula
   with respect to the Companys trailing three-month revenue and
   outstanding liability balances. Borrowed funds accrued interest at a
   floating rate per annum equal to the prime rate plus 0.25%. Amounts
   owed under the Term Loan Agreement and 2015 Credit Agreement
   (collectively, the SVB Debt Facility) were guaranteed by the Company.
   The Company also granted security interests in substantially all of its
   assets to collateralize these obligations.

   The Company had the option to repay its borrowings under the SVB Debt
   Facility without penalty prior to maturity. As of June 30, 2017, there
   was $2.0 million of principal outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement
   of the SVB Debt Facility. In November 2017, the Company terminated the
   SVB Debt Facility and repaid the remaining $1.6 million principal
   outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement as of that date. The Company
   recognized a loss of approximately $0.1 million in November 2017
   related to the write-off of the unamortized balance of loan fees on the
   SVB Debt Facility.

   2018 Revolving Credit Facility

   In November 2017, the Company entered into a four-year, $100.0 million
   secured revolving credit facility (the 2018 Credit Agreement) with
   JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which serves as administrative agent, Bank
   of America, N.A., Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, and SVB, as joint
   syndication agents, which replaced the SVB Credit Facility. Interest on
   the 2018 Credit Agreement was paid based on LIBOR plus a predetermined
   margin or base rate. The Company was required to pay a commitment fee
   of 0.375% based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility.

   In connection with the execution of the 2018 Credit Agreement, the
   Company incurred debt issuance costs of $1.2 million during the fiscal
   year ended June 30, 2018, which are capitalized and were being
   amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over
   the term of the 2018 Credit Agreement.

   Amended and Restated Credit Agreement

   In June 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated
   revolving credit agreement (Amended Credit Agreement) with JPMorgan
   Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, lead arranger and bookrunner
   and Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending
   Partners LLC and SVB, as joint syndication agents, which amended and
   restated the 2018 Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement
   provides for a $250.0 million secured revolving credit facility,
   including up to the lesser of $150.0 million and the aggregate unused
   amount of the facility for the issuance of


                                    F-21

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   letters of credit. Interest on the Amended Credit Agreement is paid
   based on LIBOR plus 2.75% or an Alternative Base Rate plus 1.75%. The
   Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.375% on a
   quarterly basis based on the unused portion of the revolving credit
   facility.

   The Company incurred total commitment fees of $0.2 million and $0.3
   million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2019,
   respectively, which are included in interest expense in the statements
   of operations.

   The principal amount, if any, is payable in full in June 2024. As of
   June 30, 2019, the Company had not drawn on the credit facility and did
   not have outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement.

   In connection with the execution of the Amended Credit Agreement, the
   Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.9 million during the fiscal
   year ended June 30, 2019, which are being capitalized and are being
   amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over
   the term of the Amended Credit Agreement. The remaining unamortized
   deferred financing fees of $0.7 million related to the 2018 Credit
   Agreement were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense
   using the effective interest method over the term of the Amended Credit
   Agreement.

   The Company has the option to repay its borrowings under the Amended
   Credit Agreement without premium or penalty prior to maturity. The
   Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, such
   as financial statement reporting requirements and delivery of borrowing
   base certificates, as well as customary covenants that restrict its
   ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell
   certain assets, guarantee obligations of third parties, declare cash
   dividends in the entirety or make certain other distributions, and
   undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other transactions. The
   Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain financial condition
   covenants, including maintaining a total level of liquidity of not less
   than $125.0 million and maintaining certain minimum total revenue
   ranging from $725.0 million to $1,985.0 million depending on the
   applicable date of determination. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was
   in compliance with the covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. At
   June 30, 2019, the Company was contingently liable for approximately
   $40.1 million in standby letters of credit as security for its
   operating lease and inventory purchasing obligations.

   11. Commitments and Contingencies

   Lease Obligations

   The Company leases facilities under operating leases with various
   expiration dates through 2039. The Companys corporate headquarters is
   located in New York, New York. The Company also leases space for the
   operation of its production studio facilities, retail showrooms,
   microstores, warehouses, and office spaces.

   Certain of the Companys lease agreements contain renewal options, rent
   escalation clauses, rent holidays or landlord incentives. Landlord
   incentives are capitalized within deferred rent and amortized as a
   reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease. Rent expense for
   non-cancellable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or
   landlord incentives is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
   lease term, including any applicable rent holidays, beginning on the
   date of initial possession, which is generally the date when the
   Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation
   for intended use. The excess of straight-line rent expense over the
   scheduled payment amounts and landlord incentives is recorded as a
   deferred rent obligation. The Company has the option to extend or renew
   most of its leases, which may increase the future minimum lease
   commitments. The Companys lease agreements for its retail showrooms
   generally provide for a fixed minimum rental plus contingent rent,
   which is determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of
   specified levels.

   Rent expense under existing operating lease agreements was
   $8.0 million, $15.1 million, and $35.8 million for the fiscal years
   ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.

   In November 2015, the Company entered into a 10-year operating lease
   agreement for its current headquarters office space at 125 West 25th
   Street, New York, New York (the 25th Street Lease). The 25th Street
   Lease commenced in November 2016, upon the date the Company took
   possession of the leased space, although cash payments for rental
   obligations under the lease did not begin until May 2017.

   In December 2017, the Company entered into a 21-year operating lease
   agreement for a New York office and retail space at 5 Manhattan West
   (the 5 Manhattan West Lease). The 5 Manhattan West Lease commenced in
   October 2018, upon the date the Company took possession of the leased
   space and the Company is committed to $99.5 million in minimum fixed
   payments over the term of the lease although cash payments for rental
   obligations under the lease do not begin until October 2019. The 5
   Manhattan West Lease contains a renewal option for two additional
   five-year periods. The 5 Manhattan West Lease includes a tenant
   improvement allowance in the future amounting to $3.0 million. This
   allowance will be reflected as a reduction in rent expense over the
   life of the lease on a straight-line basis in the consolidated
   statements of operations and as a leasehold improvement and other
   liability in the consolidated balance sheets.

   In November 2018, the Company entered into a 16-year operating lease
   agreement for space to be used as its new corporate headquarters. The
   lease is expected to commence in August 2019, upon the date the Company
   takes possession of the leased space and commits the Company to $503.0
   million in minimum fixed payments over the term of the lease. The lease
   contains a renewal option for an additional 10-year period and includes
   a tenant improvement allowance amounting to $28.0 million. As a result
   of the Companys involvement during the construction period, whereby it
   has certain indemnification obligations related to the construction,
   the Company is considered, for accounting purposes only, the owner of
   the construction project under build-to-suit lease accounting.

   Commitments

   The Company is subject to minimum guarantee royalty payments associated
   under certain music license agreements.

   Sales and Use Taxes

   The Company has recorded an estimate of $5.7 million and $4.1 million
   as of June 30, 2018 and 2019, respectively, for the potential sales tax
   liability associated with its subscription fees, which is included in
   accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
   Company continues to analyze possible sales tax exposure but does not
   currently believe that any individual claim or aggregate claims that
   might arise will ultimately have a material effect on its results of
   operations, financial position or cash flows.

   Content Costs for Past Use Reserve

   To secure the rights to stream music on the Peloton platform, the
   Company must obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, copyright
   owners of both sound recordings and musical compositions. During the
   fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, the Company has
   entered into negotiations with various music rights holders, to pay for
   any and all uses of musical compositions and sound recordings to-date
   and, at the same time, enter into go-forward license agreements for the
   use of music in the future.

   Prior to the execution of go-forward music license agreements, the
   Company estimates and records expenses inclusive of estimated content
   costs for past use (refer to Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting
   PoliciesMusic Royalty Fees) as well as normal and recurring music
   royalty expenses. The Company recorded content costs for past use of
   $15.5 million, $14.5 million, and $16.4 million during the fiscal years
   ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. In addition, the
   Company recorded estimates for normal and recurring royalty expense of
   $0.4 million, $1.0 million, and $2.8 million during the fiscal years
   ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The Company includes
   both of these components in its reserve. As of 2018, and 2019, the
   Company has recorded reserves of $18.6 million and $18.9 million,
   respectively, included in accrued expenses in the accompanying
   consolidated balance sheets.

   Legal Proceedings

   On March 19, 2019, Downtown Music Publishing LLC, ole Media Management,
   L.P., Big Deal Music, LLC, CYPMP, LLC, Peer International Corporation,
   PSO Limited, Peermusic Ltd., Peermusic III, Ltd., Peertunes, Ltd.,
   Songs of Peer Ltd., Reservoir Media Management, Inc., The Richmond
   Organization, Inc., Round Hill Music LLC, The Royalty Network, Inc.,
   and Ultra International Music Publishing, LLC filed a lawsuit against
   the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
   York, captioned Downtown Music Publg LLC, et. al v. Peloton
   Interactive, Inc., alleging that the Company engaged in copyright
   infringement by using certain accused songs in streaming and recorded
   fitness classes without necessary licenses. The plaintiffs allege that
   they are music publishers that own or control the copyrights in
   numerous musical works that were synchronized by the Company without
   the plaintiffs authorization. The complaint asserts a single claim for
   copyright infringement. It seeks injunctive relief, up to $150 million
   in damages, and attorneys fees and costs. The Company intends to
   vigorously defend the claim.

   On April 30, 2019, the Company answered the complaint and filed
   counterclaims against the original named plaintiffs and National Music
   Publishers Association, Inc., a trade association, alleging that they
   coordinated to collectively negotiate licenses in violation of the
   antitrust laws. The counterclaims also assert that the trade
   association tortuously interfered with the Companys attempts to engage
   in direct negotiations with music publishers in violation of state law.
   The counterclaims seek injunctive relief, monetary damages (to be
   trebled under applicable statute), and attorneys fees and costs. An
   initial pretrial conference was held on May 9, 2019 and discovery has
   commenced. An amended complaint filed on May 31, 2019 named additional
   plaintiffs Greensleeves Publishing Ltd., Me Gusta Music, LLC, Raleigh
   Music Publishing LLC, STB Music, Inc., and TuneCore, Inc. and
   identified additional musical works. The Company answered the amended
   complaint on June 14, 2019. On June 24, 2019, counter-defendants filed
   a motion to dismiss the counterclaims, to which the Company filed an
   opposition on August 8, 2019. Discovery on the claims and counterclaims
   is ongoing in the case.

   While the Company cannot predict what the ultimate result of any
   judgment against, or settlement by, the Company, will be in this
   matter, based on application of ASC 450, Contingencies, at June 30,
   2019, the Company has accrued its best estimate within a range of
   reasonably possible outcomes ranging from $4.0 million to $11.0
   million, which is included in

   accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
   Amounts accrued for this matter at June 30, 2019 are not considered
   material to the Companys financial position and the Company continues
   to vigorously defend its position in the aforementioned outstanding
   matter and assess its legal position.

   In addition to the above, from time to time, the Company is subject to
   litigation matters and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its
   business. The Company believes that the outcome of any existing
   litigation, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a
   material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or
   cash flows of the Company.

   12. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders Equity

   Stock Split

   In August 2018, the Company effected a 4-for-1 stock split on its
   shares of common stock. Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and
   share information included in the financial statements and notes
   thereto have been retroactively adjusted for the stock split as if such
   stock split occurred on the first day of the first period presented.

   Common Stock

   In connection with the conversion to a corporation in April 2015, the
   Company authorized common stock with a par value of $0.000025 per
   share. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, there were 266,946,216 and
   400,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, respectively, and
   25,936,848 and 25,301,604 shares of common stock outstanding,
   respectively.

   Warrant Transactions

   In June 2015, the Company issued 240,000 common stock warrants in
   connection with the Term Loan Agreement with SVB (see Note 10). The
   warrants were initially recorded at their fair value calculated using
   the Black-Scholes model, with the following weighted-average
   assumptions: exercise price of $0.19 per share, price of $0.19 per
   share, expected term of 10 years, risk-free rate of 2.35%, and
   volatility of 90%. The fair value of the warrants of $38,000 was
   recorded as deferred financing costs and such costs were amortized to
   interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of
   the loan. In connection with the termination of the SVB Debt Facility
   in November 2017, the Company recognized the remaining balance of
   unamortized deferred financing costs, including the amount related to
   the warrants, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (see Note 10).

   Preferred Stock

   As of June 30, 2019, the Companys fifth amended and restated
   certificate of incorporation authorized the issuance of up to
   215,443,468 shares of Preferred Stock, designated as follows:
   10,617,908 shares as Series A Preferred Stock, 25,799,744 as Series B
   Preferred Stock, 48,246,732 as Series C Preferred Stock, 31,635,604 as
   Series D Preferred Stock, and 60,013,480 as Series E Preferred Stock,
   and 39,130,000 as Series F Preferred Stock.

   Series E Financing & Tender Offer

   In March 2017, the Company filed its third amended and restated
   certificate of incorporation, which authorized the issuance of
   60,013,480 shares Series E Preferred Stock with rights and preferences,
   including voting rights, as determined from time to time by the Board
   of Directors. In May 2017, the Company filed an amendment to the
   certificate of incorporation which decreased the authorized number of
   shares of common stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
   Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock, to a total of 266,946,216 shares,
   27,169,432 shares, 49,375,076 shares, and 31,635,604 shares,
   respectively.

   In March 2017, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement
   with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which it sold and issued
   40,624,492 shares of its newly created Series E Preferred Stock at a
   purchase price of approximately $5.42 per share (the Series E Share
   Price) in an initial closing. Between April 1, 2017 and May 31, 2017,

   issuance costs of $9.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30,
   2017 in connection with the Series E Financing, which are recorded as a
   reduction of the Series E Preferred Stock share balance.

   In connection with closing of the Series E Financing, the Company used
   approximately $175.0 million of the proceeds from the Series E
   Financing to repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock and
   Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock from certain
   existing stockholders at the Series E Share Price. The repurchase
   occurred through a series of share repurchase transactions in
   conjunction with the initial and subsequent closings of the Series E
   Financing, in addition to a tender offer made by the Company following
   the closing of the Series E Financing (the 2017 Tender Offer). The
   2017 Tender Offer was made to certain existing equity holders of the
   Company to repurchase shares of the Companys capital stock and options
   to purchase such shares of capital stock from such equity holders at a
   gross repurchase price equal to the Series E Share Price. The aggregate
   gross repurchase amounts under the Series E Financing closings and the
   2017 Tender Offer were $122.7 million and $52.3 million, respectively.
   In connection therewith, the Company repurchased 9,717,464 shares of
   common stock, 2,381,576 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 1,504,660
   shares of Series B Preferred Stock, 5,290,300 shares of Series C
   Preferred Stock, and 13,420,940 shares of Series D Preferred Stock each
   at the Series E Share Price. The repurchased shares were retired and
   considered authorized, but not issued or outstanding, pursuant to the
   Companys third amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The
   repurchase price of the redeemable convertible preferred stock,
   including closing costs, of $118.7 million exceeded the carrying value
   of $26.4 million at the date of repurchase. For the computation of net
   loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year
   ended June 30, 2017, the repurchase price in excess of the then
   carrying value of the Preferred Stock of $92.3 million was recorded as
   a reduction to net loss in computing net loss attributable to common
   stockholders.

   In accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, the Company recorded
   stock-based compensation expense of $8.3 million in the fiscal year
   ended June 30, 2017, which represents the excess of the tender offer
   repurchase price over the fair value of the shares repurchased which
   were held by employees and is included within general and
   administrative operating expenses in the consolidated statements of
   operations. For shares sold by stockholders who were not employees, the
   Company recorded the excess of the tender offer repurchase price over
   the fair value of the shares repurchased as a reduction to retained
   earnings. The Company recorded a reduction in redeemable convertible
   preferred stock and stockholders equity, net of closing costs, of
   $161.6 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 for the share
   repurchase transaction.

   In connection with the share repurchase transactions, the Company
   incurred transaction costs of $4.4 million directly related to the
   share repurchase, which are recorded as a reduction in stockholders
   equity as of June 30, 2017.

   Series F Financing and Tender Offer

   On August 29, 2018, the Company filed its fourth amended and restated
   certificate of incorporation, which authorized the issuance of
   39,130,000 shares Series F Preferred Stock with rights and preferences,
   including voting rights, as determined from time to time by the Board
   of Directors.

   In August 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase
   agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which it sold
   and issued 38,088,200 shares of its newly created Series F Preferred
   Stock (the Series F Financing) at a purchase price of $14.44018 per
   share (the Series F Share Price). The aggregate gross proceeds from
   the Series F Financing were approximately $550.0 million. The Company
   incurred issuance costs of $10.9 million during the fiscal year ended
   June 30, 2019 in connection with the Series F Financing, which were
   recorded as a reduction of the Series F Preferred Stock share balance.

   In connection with the closing of the Series F Financing, the Company
   used approximately $130.0 million of the proceeds from the Series F
   Financing to repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock and
   Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series E Preferred Stock from certain
   existing stockholders at the Series F Share Price. The repurchase
   occurred through a tender offer made by the Company following the
   closing of the Series F Financing (the 2018 Tender Offer). The 2018

   Tender Offer was made to certain existing equity holders of the Company
   to repurchase shares of the Companys capital stock and options to
   purchase such shares of capital stock from such equity holders at a
   gross repurchase price equal to the Series F Share Price. In connection
   therewith, the Company repurchased 5,503,479 shares of common stock,
   1,091,444 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 1,100,257 shares of
   Series B Preferred Stock, 998,368 shares of Series C Preferred Stock,
   and 570,970 shares of Series E Preferred Stock each at the Series F
   Share Price. The repurchased shares were retired and considered
   authorized, but not issued or outstanding, pursuant to the Companys
   fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The
   repurchase price of the redeemable convertible preferred stock,
   including closing costs, of $54.4 million exceeded the carrying value
   of $4.3 million at the date of repurchase. For the computation of net
   loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year
   ended June 30, 2019, the repurchase price in excess of the then
   carrying value of the Preferred Stock of $50.1 million was recorded as
   a reduction to net loss in computing net loss attributable to common
   stockholders.

   In accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, the Company recorded
   stock-based compensation expense of $28.2 million in the fiscal year
   ended June 30, 2019, which represents the excess of the tender offer
   repurchase price over the fair value of the shares repurchased which
   were held by employees and is included within operating expenses in the
   statements of operations. For shares sold by stockholders who were not
   employees, the Company recorded the excess of the tender offer
   repurchase price over the fair value of the shares repurchased as a
   reduction to retained earnings. The Company recorded a reduction in
   redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity, on a
   gross basis, of $104.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30,
   2019 for the share repurchase transaction.

   In connection with the share repurchase transactions, the Company
   incurred transaction costs of $2.7 million directly related to the
   share repurchase, which are recorded as a reduction in stockholders
   deficit as of June 30, 2019.

   Pursuant to ASC 718-10-25-15, the Company reflects the substantive
   terms of its employee share-based payments in accounting for the
   arrangements. With the 2018 Tender Offer, the Company believes that it
   has established a pattern of cash settlement of immature shares and
   stock options only during a very discrete set of circumstances in which
   the Company opens a tender offer in conjunction with preferred stock
   financing. As such, during the 2018 Tender Offer period, the Company
   recorded a liability equal to the fair value of the maximum number of
   options representing immature shares that could have been redeemed in
   the tender offer. To the extent that this liability exceeded amounts
   previously recognized in equity, the excess was recognized as
   additional stock-based compensation expense. Following the closing of
   the 2018 Tender Offer, the remaining liability after the repurchase of
   tendered shares was reclassified to stockholders equity. The Company
   recorded stock-based compensation expense of $33.5 million associated
   with this tender offer.

   Dividends

   The holders of shares of preferred stock, in preference to the holders
   of common stock, are entitled to receive dividends upon declaration by
   the Board of Directors. Such dividends are non-cumulative and are
   payable at a per annum rate of eight percent of the original share
   issue price. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, no dividends have been
   declared or distributed to any stockholders.

   Conversion

   Each share of preferred stock is convertible, at any time, at its
   holders discretion, into one fully paid and non-assessable share of
   common stock. The conversion rate shall be adjusted whenever the
   Company shall issue or sell, or is deemed to have issued or sold, any
   shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the
   conversion price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue
   or sale.

   The Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
   Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock shall be automatically
   converted into common stock upon the consummation of a qualified
   initial public offering at a public offering price of not less than
   $30.0 million in the aggregate. The Series E Preferred Stock and Series
   F Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into common stock
   upon the consummation of an initial public offering at a public
   offering price of not less than $75.0 million in the aggregate. In
   addition, at any time prior to consummation of an initial public
   offering,

   (1) all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
   Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock shall be automatically
   converted into common stock upon the affirmative election of holders of

   Series B Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock, voting together
   as a single class on an as-converted to common stock basis; (2) all of

   such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be
   paid.

   Liquidation Preferences

   In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
   Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Series B
   Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock,
   Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F Preferred Stock, in preference
   to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and common stock, shall be
   entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company that are legally
   available for distribution, an amount equal to the applicable original
   issue price per share, for each share of Preferred Stock held by them,
   plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares. In the event
   that the assets available for distribution are not sufficient to pay
   the full preferential amounts, the assets will be distributed pro rata
   among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
   Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F
   Preferred Stock, in proportion to the full preferential amount that
   each such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive. The aggregate
   preferential amount for Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
   Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, and Series E Preferred Stock, and
   Series F Preferred Stock was $413.6 million and $959.5 million as of
   June 30, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

   After payment of the full liquidation preference of the Series B
   Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock,
   Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F Preferred Stock, before any
   distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of common stock,
   the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid
   out of the remaining assets of the Company legally available for
   distribution, if any, in an amount equal to the applicable original
   issue price per share, for each share of Preferred Stock held by them,
   plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.
   In the event that the assets available for distribution are not
   sufficient to pay the full such preferential amount, the available
   assets shall be distributed pro rata among the holders of Series A
   Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount that each
   such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive. The aggregate
   preferential amount for the Series A Preferred Stock was $2.7 million
   and $2.4 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2019.

   After payment of the liquidation preferences to the holders of the
   Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
   Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, and Series E Preferred Stock, and
   Series F Preferred Stock, the entire remaining assets and funds of the
   Company legally available for distribution, if any, shall be
   distributed ratably to the holders of common stock.

   Voting

   The holder of each share of preferred stock is entitled to one vote for
   each share of common stock into which such preferred stock is
   convertible at the time of the vote. With respect to such vote, such
   holder has full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights of
   the holders of common stock.

   For so long as any shares of preferred stock remain outstanding, the
   vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
   preferred stock shall be required for effecting or validating certain
   actions, including: (1) consummation of a liquidation event or any
   other merger or consolidation; (2) any amendment, alteration, or repeal
   of the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the Company;
   (3) any increase or decrease in the authorized number of shares of
   common stock or preferred stock or any series thereof; (4) any
   authorization or designation, whether by reclassification or otherwise,
   of a new class or series of stock that is not junior to the existing
   series of preferred stock with respect to dividends,

   13. Equity-Based Compensation

   2015 Stock Plan

   In April 2015, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of the
   2015 Stock Plan (2015 Plan) to provide stock award grants to
   employees, directors, and consultants of the Company. The Board of
   Directors, or at its sole discretion, a committee of the Board of
   Directors, is responsible for the administration of the 2015 Plan. As
   of June 30, 2019, the Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of
   up to 85,725,084 shares of common stock for stock award grants,
   including incentive and non-statutory stock options.

   The 2015 Plan requires that the per share exercise price of each stock
   option shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the
   common stock subject to the stock option on the grant date. Stock
   option grants shall not be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years
   from the date of its grant or such shorter period as specified in a
   stock award agreement. For

   initial grants, vesting generally occurs over four years with the first
   25% of the award vesting upon the 12-month anniversary of the vesting
   commencement date and the remaining 75% vesting monthly over the
   following 36 months. The 2015 Plan provides that the Board of Directors
   may, in its sole discretion, impose such limitations on transferability
   of stock options as the Board of Directors shall determine. In the
   absence of a determination by the Board of Directors to the contrary,
   stock options shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws
   of descent and distribution and domestic relations orders, unless
   specifically agreed to by the plan administrator.

   The 2015 Plan allows for the early exercise of stock options. Shares
   purchased pursuant to the early exercise of stock options are subject
   to repurchase until those shares vest; therefore, cash received in
   exchange for unvested shares exercised is recorded as a liability on
   the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and are reclassified to
   common stock and additional paid-in capital as the shares vest.

   During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the Company granted options
   to purchase 4,274,000 shares under the 2015 Plan, consisting of
   1,805,552 shares subject to incentive stock options and 2,468,448
   shares subject to non-statutory stock options. During the fiscal year
   ended June 30, 2018, the Company granted options to purchase 23,847,756
   shares under the 2015 Plan, consisting of 5,268,903 shares subject to
   incentive stock options and 18,578,853 shares subject to non-statutory
   stock options. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company
   granted options to purchase 32,108,062 shares under the 2015 Plan,
   consisting of 5,594,291 shares subject to incentive stock options and
   26,513,771 subject to non-statutory stock options.

   For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, the
   weighted-average grant date fair value per option was $0.53, $1.67, and
   $6.71, respectively. The fair value of each option was estimated at the
   grant date using the Black-Scholes method with the following
   assumptions:

   Expected volatility is based on an analysis of comparable public
   company volatilities and adjusted for the Companys stage of
   development.

   With respect to the 2015 Plan, the Company recognized stock
   compensation expense of $1.9 million, $8.5 million, and $28.5 million
   for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.
   As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $217.2 million of unrecognized
   stock-based compensation expense that is expected to be recognized over
   a weighted-average period of 3.9 years.

   14. Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers and Vendors

   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
   significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
   and cash equivalents. The Companys cash and cash equivalents are
   maintained with high-quality financial institutions, the compositions
   and maturities of which are regularly monitored by management.

   For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, there were no
   customers representing greater than 10% of the Companys total revenue.

   The Companys top three vendors accounted for approximately 94% and 91%
   of total finished goods purchases for the fiscal years ended June 30,
   2017 and 2018, respectively.

   The Companys top four vendors accounted for approximately 91% of total
   finished goods purchases for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.

   15. Income Taxes

   The Companys provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended
   June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019 was zero, $0.1 million, and $0.1 million,
   respectively. The tax income provision consists of the Texas state
   franchise tax and international income taxes.

   A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the
   effective income tax rate is as follows:

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Companys
   effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 are due to
   the change in valuation allowance and permanent differences related to
   stock compensation. The primary differences from the U.S. statutory
   rate and the Companys effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended
   June 30, 2018 are due to the rate change on deferred tax assets as a
   result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Act), partially
   offset by state and local taxes and federal tax credits. The primary
   differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Companys effective
   tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 are due to the change
   in valuation allowance, partially offset by state and local taxes.

   On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law making significant
   changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal
   Revenue Code). Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal
   corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning
   after December 31, 2017, a one-time transition tax on the mandatory
   deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, and numerous domestic and
   international-related provisions effective in 2018. The Company has
   estimated its provision for income taxes specifically related to the
   reduction of the federal corporate tax rate in accordance with the Act
   and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result
   has recorded $18.0 million of income tax expense, which was offset by a
   corresponding adjustment for the same amount to the Companys valuation
   allowance, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.

   On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) was
   issued to address the application of GAAP in situations when a
   registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared,
   or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete
   the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. For the
   fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded $18.0 million of
   the income tax expense in connection with the re-measurement of certain
   deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of June 30, 2019, the Company
   has completed the accounting for all the impacts of the Act with no
   material changes to the provisional estimate recorded in the prior
   period.

   As of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019, the Companys deferred tax
   assets were primarily the result of U.S. federal and state net
   operating losses (NOLs), deferred revenue, research and development
   tax credits, non-qualified stock options, and accrued litigation
   reserves. A valuation allowance was maintained on substantially all
   worldwide gross deferred tax asset balances as of June 30, 2018 and
   2019. As of each reporting date, the Companys management considers new
   evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact managements
   view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. The
   recognition of deferred tax assets was based on the evaluation of
   current and estimated future profitability of the operations, reversal
   of deferred tax liabilities and the likelihood of utilizing tax credit
   and/or loss carryforwards. As of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019, the
   Company continued to maintain that it is not more likely than not that
   its deferred taxes will be realized in the United States and United
   Kingdom due to managements expectation of continued tax losses for the
   foreseeable future.

   As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Company had federal NOLs of
   approximately $110.0 million and $112.6 million, respectively, of which
   $59.3 million will begin to expire in 2036 and the remainder will be
   carried forward indefinitely. The Company has undergone two ownership
   changes on November 30, 2015 and April 18, 2017 and its NOLs are
   subject to a Section 382 limitation. The total NOLs subject to a 382
   limitation are $72,338 as of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019. The
   resulting Section 382 limitations are large enough to avail the Section
   382 limited NOLs by June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the
   Company had state NOLs of approximately $94.0 million and $95.8
   million, respectively, which will begin to expire at various dates
   beginning in 2021 if not utilized. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the
   Company had foreign NOLs of zero and approximately $26.7 million,
   respectively, generated from its operations in the United Kingdom,
   which will be carried forward indefinitely. As of June 30, 2018 and
   2019, the Company had $2.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively, of
   U.S. research and development credit carryovers that will begin to
   expire in 2036.

   As of June 30, 2019, the Company did not have material undistributed
   foreign earnings. The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability
   for foreign withholding or other foreign local tax on the undistributed
   earnings from the Companys international subsidiaries as such earnings
   are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

   The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a
   recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial
   statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or
   expected to be taken in a tax return. For benefits to be recognized, a
   tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon
   examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized is
   measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50%
   likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement. As of
   June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Company has not recognized any uncertain
   tax positions.

   The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various state
   and local jurisdictions, Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The
   tax years ended June 30, 2018, February 25, 2018, February 26, 2017 and
   February 29, 2016 remain subject to examination by tax authorities.

   Unaudited Pro Forma Net Loss Per Share

   The unaudited pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share
   attributable to common stockholders has been computed to give effect to
   the assumed automatic conversion of the redeemable convertible
   preferred stock into shares of common stock using the if converted
   method upon the completion of a qualifying IPO as though the conversion
   had occurred as of the beginning of the period, or original date of
   issuance if later.

   The following table sets forth the computation of the Companys
   unaudited pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share attributable
   to common stockholders for the period indicated:

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   17. Segment Information

   The Company applies ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, in determining
   reportable segments for its financial statement disclosure. The Company
   has three reportable segments: Connected Fitness Products,
   Subscription, and Other. Segment information is presented in the same
   manner that the Companys Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM)
   reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating
   resources. The CODM reviews revenue and gross profit for each of the
   reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of
   revenue incurred by the segment. No operating segments have been
   aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company does not
   allocate assets at the reportable segment level as these are managed on
   an entity wide group basis. As of June 30, 2019, the Company did not
   have material assets located outside of the United States.

   The Connected Fitness Product segment derives revenue from sale of the
   Bike, Tread, and related accessories, and associated fees for delivery
   and installation and extended warranty agreements. The Subscription
   segment derives revenue from monthly Subscription fees as well as
   credits from live studio classes. The Other segment primarily consists
   of boutique and apparel sales. There are no internal revenue
   transactions between the Companys segments.

   Key financial performance measures of the segments including revenue,
   cost of revenue, and gross profit are as follows:


                            Fiscal Year Ended June 30,

   ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

   Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL,
   authorizes a court to award, or a corporations board of directors to
   grant, indemnity to directors and officers under certain circumstances
   and subject to certain limitations. The terms of Section 145 of the
   DGCL are sufficiently broad to permit indemnification under certain
   circumstances for liabilities, including reimbursement of expenses
   incurred, arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
   Securities Act.

   As permitted by the DGCL, the Registrants restated certificate of
   incorporation that will be in effect following the completion of this
   offering contains provisions that eliminate the personal liability of
   its directors for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties
   as a director, except liability for the following:


     

   any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Registrant or its
   stockholders;


     

   acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional
   misconduct or a knowing violation of law;


     

   under Section 174 of the DGCL (regarding unlawful dividends and stock
   purchases); or


     

   any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
   benefit.

   As permitted by the DGCL, the Registrants restated bylaws that will be
   in effect following the completion of this offering provide that:


     

   the Registrant is required to indemnify its directors and executive
   officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, subject to very
   limited exceptions;


     

   the Registrant may indemnify its other employees and agents as set
   forth in the DGCL;


     

   the Registrant is required to advance expenses, as incurred, to its
   directors and executive officers in connection with a legal proceeding
   to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, subject to very limited
   exceptions; and


     

   the rights conferred in the restated bylaws are not exclusive.


                                    II-1
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   Prior to this offering, the Registrant has entered into indemnification
   agreements with each of its current directors and executive officers to
   provide these directors and executive officers additional contractual
   assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in the
   Registrants restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws
   and to provide additional procedural protections. At present, there is
   no pending litigation or proceeding involving a director, executive
   officer, or employee of the Registrant regarding which indemnification
   is sought. Reference is also made to the underwriting agreement filed
   as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement, which provides for the
   indemnification of executive officers, directors, and controlling
   persons of the Registrant against certain liabilities. The
   indemnification provisions in the Registrants restated certificate of
   incorporation and restated bylaws and the indemnification agreements
   entered into or to be entered into between the Registrant and each of
   its directors and executive officers may be sufficiently broad to
   permit indemnification of the Registrants directors and executive
   officers for liabilities arising under the Securities Act.

   The Registrant has directors and officers liability insurance for its
   directors and officers.

   Certain of the Registrants directors are also indemnified by their
   employers with regard to their service on the Registrants board of
   directors.

   In addition, the underwriting agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this
   registration statement provides for indemnification by the underwriters
   of the Registrant and its officers and directors for certain
   liabilities arising under the Securities Act, or otherwise.

   Regulation S promulgated thereunder), or Rule 701 promulgated under
   Section 3(b) of the Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not
   involving any public offering or pursuant to benefit plans and
   contracts relating to compensation as provided under Rule 701. The
   recipients of the securities in each of these transactions represented
   their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not
   with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof,
   and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued
   in these transactions.

   ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS

   The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the
   underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement
   certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as
   required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each
   purchaser.

   Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
   Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of
   the Registrant pursuant to provisions described in Item 14 above, or
   otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
   Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against
   public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
   unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
   such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses
   incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the
   Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)
   is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
   connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will,
   unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
   controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
   the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
   policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the
   final adjudication of such issue.

   The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that:

   (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act,
   the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of
   this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in
   a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1)
   or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of
   this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.

   (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities
   Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus
   shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the
   securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that
   time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

   This summary highlights selected information contained in more detail
   elsewhere in this prospectus. This summary does not contain all the
   information you should consider before investing in our Class A common
   stock. You should carefully read this prospectus in its entirety before
   investing in our Class A common stock, including the sections titled
   Risk Factors, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
   Condition and Results of Operations, and Special Note Regarding
   Forward-Looking Statements, and our consolidated financial statements
   and the accompanying notes, provided elsewhere in this prospectus. Our
   fiscal year end is June 30, and our fiscal quarters end on
   September 30, December 31, March 31, and June 30. Our fiscal years
   ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019 are referred to herein as fiscal
   2017, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019, respectively.

                                  Overview

   Our Purpose

   We believe physical activity is fundamental to a healthy and happy
   life. Our ambition is to empower people to improve their lives through
   fitness.

   We are a technology company that meshes the physical and digital worlds
   to create a completely new, immersive, and connected fitness
   experience. We are also:

   a media company that creates engaging-to-the-point-of-addictive
   original programming with the best instructors in the world.

   an interactive software company that motivates our Members to achieve
   their goals.

   a product design company that develops beautiful and intuitive
   equipment that anticipates the needs of our Members.

   a social connection company that enables our community to support one
   another.

   a direct-to-consumer, multi-channel retail company that facilitates a
   seamless customer journey.

   an apparel company that allows Members to display their passion for
   Peloton.

   a logistics company that provides high-touch delivery, set up, and
   service for our Members.

   We are driven by our Members-first obsession and we will be any company
   we need to be in order to deliver the best fitness experience possible.

   Who We Are

   Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a
   loyal community of over 1.4 million Members. We pioneered connected,
   technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive,
   instructor-led boutique classes to our Members anytime, anywhere. We
   make fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient,
   while fostering social connections that encourage our Members to be the
   best versions of themselves. We define a Member as any individual who
   has a Peloton account.

   We are an innovation company at the nexus of fitness, technology, and
   media. We have disrupted the fitness industry by developing a
   first-of-its-kind subscription platform that seamlessly combines the
   best equipment, proprietary networked software, and world-class
   streaming digital fitness and wellness content, creating a product that
   our Members love. Our highly compelling offering helped our Members
   complete over 58 million Peloton workouts in fiscal 2019.

   Driven by our Members-first mindset, we built a vertically integrated
   platform that ensures a best-in-class, end-to-end experience. We have a
   direct-to-consumer multi-channel sales platform, including 74 showrooms
   with knowledgeable sales specialists, a high-touch delivery service,
   and helpful Member support teams. Our Members are as devoted to us as
   we are to them92% of our interactive fitness equipment ever sold,
   which we refer to as our Connected Fitness Products, still had an
   active Connected Fitness Subscription attached as of June 30, 2019.

Table of Contents

   Our Connected Fitness Product offerings currently include the Peloton
   Bike, launched in 2014, and the Peloton Tread, launched in 2018. Both
   our Bike and Tread include a state-of-the-art touchscreen that streams
   live and on-demand classes. Our products have a multitude of
   interactive software features that encourage frequent use, facilitate
   healthy competition on our patented leaderboard, build community among
   our Members, and inspire our Members to track performance and achieve
   their goals with real-time and historical metrics. As of June 30, 2019,
   we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products, with
   approximately 564,000 sold in the United States.

   Our world-class instructors teach classes across a variety of fitness
   and wellness disciplines, including indoor cycling, indoor/outdoor
   running and walking, bootcamp, yoga, strength training, stretching, and
   meditation. We produce over 950 original programs per month and
   maintain a vast and constantly updated library of thousands of original
   fitness and wellness programs. We make it easy for Members to find a
   class that fits their interests based on class type, instructor, music
   genre, length, available equipment, area of physical focus, and level
   of difficulty.

   Our content is available on our Connected Fitness Products through a
   $39.00 monthly Connected Fitness Subscription, which allows for
   unlimited workouts across multiple users within a household. Our
   Connected Fitness Subscribers can enjoy our classes anywhere through
   our digital app, Peloton Digital, which is available through iOS and
   Android mobile devices, as well as most tablets and computers. We also
   have Digital Subscribers who pay $19.49 per month for access to our
   content library on their own devices.

   Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our Connected
   Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue. We have
   experienced significant growth in sales of Connected Fitness Products,
   which, when combined with our strong Connected Fitness Subscriber
   retention rates, has driven high growth in Connected Fitness
   Subscribers. Our Connected Fitness Subscriber base grew by 108% in
   fiscal 2019.

   Our compelling financial profile is characterized by high growth,
   strong retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient
   customer acquisition. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness
   Churn, together with our high Subscription Contribution Margin,
   generates attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. When
   we acquire new Connected Fitness Subscribers, we are able to offset our
   customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our
   Connected Fitness Products. This allows for rapid payback of our sales
   and marketing investments and results in a robust unit economic model.

   We are a fast-growing and scaled fitness platform. For fiscal 2017,
   2018, and 2019:


     

   we generated total revenue of $218.6 million, $435.0 million, and
   $915.0 million, respectively, representing 99.0% and 110.3%
   year-over-year growth;


     

   we incurred net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and
   $(195.6) million, respectively; and


     

   our Adjusted EBITDA was $(51.8) million, $(30.4) million, and $(71.3)
   million, respectively.

   See the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and
   Other DataNon-GAAP Financial Measures for information regarding our
   use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted
   EBITDA.

   For fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, key metrics of our business included:


     

   Connected Fitness Subscribers of 107,708, 245,667, and 511,202,
   respectively; and


     

   Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn of 0.70%, 0.64%, and 0.65%,
   respectively.

   For a definition of Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, see
   the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
   Condition and Results of OperationsBusiness Model and for a
   definition of Connected Fitness Subscribers, Average Net Monthly
   Connected Fitness Churn, and Subscription Contribution Margin, see the

   Our Industry and Opportunity

   Industry

   We participate in the massive and growing global health and wellness
   industry. According to a 2018 report by the Global Wellness Institute,
   the total global spend on the wellness industry in 2017 was $4.2
   trillion, of which the global fitness and certain categories of
   wellness, including meditation and yoga, spend represented nearly
   $600 billion. According to the International Health, Racquet &
   Sportsclub Association, or IHRSA, 183 million and 62 million people had
   gym memberships globally and in the United States, respectively, as of
   2018.

   Our current product portfolio, which consists of our Bike, Tread, and
   fitness and wellness subscription services, addresses a large consumer
   base. Within our current and announced markets (the United States, the
   United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany), we estimate that 75 million
   people used treadmills and 27 million used stationary cycling bikes in
   the 12 months ended March 2019. In those same regions, we estimate that
   over 5 million treadmills and nearly 3 million stationary cycling bikes
   were purchased for in-home use in the 12 months ended March 2019.

   We believe that we are significantly expanding the market for fitness
   equipment and products. According to our 2019 Member Survey, four out
   of five Members were not in the market for home fitness equipment prior
   to purchasing a Peloton Connected Fitness Product.

   Opportunity

   We consider our market opportunity in terms of a Total Addressable
   Market, or TAM, which we believe is the market we can reach over the
   long-term in our current and announced markets, and a Serviceable
   Addressable Market, or SAM, which we address with our current product
   verticals and price points.

   According to our research, our TAM is 67 million households, of which
   45 million are in the United States. Within our TAM, we estimate that
   52 million households are interested in learning more about our
   Connected Fitness Products without seeing the price. We estimate that
   our SAM is 14 million Connected Fitness Products, with 12 million
   represented in the United States. Historically, our SAM has grown as
   our brand awareness has increased. With low brand awareness in our
   current international markets, we believe we will see SAM expand as we
   make further investments in building brand and product awareness in
   these regions. We will grow both TAM and SAM as we expand beyond our
   current geographies and grow SAM as we develop new Connected Fitness
   Products and content in new fitness verticals. With approximately
   577,000 Connected Fitness Products sold globally as of June 30, 2019,
   we are approximately 4% penetrated in our SAM of 14 million. For a
   discussion of the methodology used in determining our TAM and SAM, see
   the section titled Industry and Market Data.

   Consumer Trends in Our Favor

   Increasing Focus on Health and Wellness

   The growing awareness of the benefits of exercise and physical activity
   is driving increasing participation and spend in fitness and wellness.
   This has translated into consistent year-over-year growth of the
   fitness industry both in the United States and globally over the past
   two decades, even during times of economic recession. According to
   IHRSA, health club industry revenues in the United States grew at a
   5.4% annual growth rate over the last ten years. In addition, employers
   and health insurance companies are investing in employee well-being by
   offering incentives for preventative health measures such as exercise.
   According to a 2017 study by the National Business Group on Health, 74%
   of employers offer employee wellness incentives, with the average
   employee incentive amount increasing from $521 in 2013 to $742 in
   2017.^

   Streaming Media is the Leading Channel of Consumption

   The quality, volume, and speed of streaming content has profoundly
   changed media consumption patterns. Consumers can select from extensive
   catalogs of content across video programming, music, books, and gaming,
   among other categories, allowing for personalized, on-demand
   consumption anywhere, anytime, and at a great value. According to
   Kagan, a media research group of S&P Global Market Intelligence, global
   digital music paid subscribers are estimated to have grown from
   12.1 million in 2012 to 162.5 million in 2018. Similarly, digital video
   paid subscribers are estimated to have increased in the United States
   from 37.6 million in 2012 to 167.8 million in 2018.

   Desire for Community and Shared Experiences

   We believe consumers are increasingly spending on experiences and are
   seeking meaningful community connections. Within the fitness industry,
   consumers have migrated to boutique fitness due to personalization,
   expert instruction, and the sense of community. Boutique-style fitness
   offerings are the fastest growing brick-and-mortar fitness category.
   According to IHRSA, as of 2017, 40% of members of health and fitness
   clubs reported belonging to a boutique fitness studio, and from 2013 to
   2017, membership in boutique studios grew approximately 121%.

   Demand for Convenience

   Household trends, longer working hours, and the rise of mobile
   technology make it challenging to balance time between family, work,
   and personal health and wellness. According to the Pew Research Center,
   over the last few decades, there has been an increase in dual income
   families from 49% in 1970 to 66% in 2016. We believe that busy
   lifestyles, less free time, and changing household dynamics are driving
   demand for convenient fitness options.

   What Sets Us Apart

   Category-Defining Brand with Broad Appeal

   Peloton is the pioneer of connected, technology-enabled fitness. By
   meshing the physical and digital worlds, we have created an immersive
   experience that our Members love. We have scaled rapidly through
   data-driven marketing and education-based



                                      4

   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   sales efforts. Our marketing is made more efficient by the significant
   word-of-mouth referrals from our loyal Members, which has become one of
   our largest sales channels. As a result of strong Connected Fitness
   Product sales and low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, we
   have grown our Connected Fitness Subscribers from 35,135 as of June 30,
   2016 to 511,202 as of June 30, 2019, representing annualized growth of
   approximately 144.1%.

   We are democratizing access to high-quality boutique fitness by making
   it accessible and affordable through the compelling value of our
   unlimited household Connected Fitness Subscriptions and attractive
   financing programs for the Bike and Tread. We continue to broaden our
   demographic appealour fastest growing demographic segments are
   consumers under 35 years old and those with household incomes under
   $75,000.

   Growing and Scaled Platform with Network Effects

   As the largest interactive fitness platform in the world, our rapidly
   growing and scaled Member base is a highly strategic asset. With our
   first mover advantage, we have achieved critical mass, which improves
   our platform and Member experience. As of June 30, 2019, on average,
   nearly 6,400 Members participated in each cycling class, across live
   and on-demand. As our community of Members continues to grow, the
   Peloton fitness experience becomes more inspiring, more competitive,
   more immersive, and more connected. Over time, Members are embedded in
   the Peloton community and we become a part of their lives, increasing
   the opportunity cost of Members leaving or potential Members not
   joining our platform.

   Engaging-to-the-Point-of-Addictive Fitness Experience Drives High
   Retention

   By making fitness fun and motivating, we help our Members achieve their
   personal goals. We analyze millions of workouts per month to help us
   develop features that improve our Member experience and create new,
   on-trend fitness and wellness content that our Members crave.
   Engagement is the leading indicator of retention for our Connected
   Fitness Subscribers. We have consistently seen workouts increase over
   time. On average, our Connected Fitness Subscribers completed 7.5, 8.4,
   and 11.5 workouts per month in fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019,
   respectively. Usage drives value and loyalty, which is evidenced by our
   exceptional weighted-average 12-month Connected Fitness Subscriber
   retention rate of 95% across all fiscal year cohorts since fiscal 2016.

   Vertically Integrated Platform That is Difficult to Replicate

   We are driven by our Members-first obsession and see every Member
   touchpoint as an opportunity to exceed expectations. To create the best
   platform, we designed our own products, developed our own interactive
   software, and created our own high production value fitness and
   wellness programming. For full end-to-end Member support, we were also
   compelled to develop our own customer education, purchase and delivery,
   and services platform. We sell our Connected Fitness Products
   exclusively through our knowledgeable inside sales and showroom
   associates as well as our e-commerce site. Our high-touch delivery
   teams ensure that new Members are immediately set up and ready to work
   out on their new Bike or Tread. The effectiveness of our end-to-end
   platform is demonstrated by the high Net Promoter Score for our Bike,
   which has been within the range of 80 to 93 since we began measuring it
   in 2016.

   Compelling Financial Model

   Our financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong
   retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer
   acquisition. Our growth is attributable to our data-driven marketing
   approach and Member word-of-mouth referrals, both of which help us
   generate predictable and increasingly efficient Connected Fitness
   Product sales. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn,
   combined with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, results in
   attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. We offset
   customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our
   Connected Fitness Products, generating rapid payback of sales and
   marketing investments and robust unit economics.

   Founder-Led, Passionate Team

   Peloton was founded by John Foley in 2012. Along with his four
   co-founders, John set out to create the most convenient and immersive
   indoor cycling experience in the world. Our founders believed deeply
   that creating a Members-first experience would require Peloton to be as
   vertically integrated as possible, and so we built teams that span
   software development, product design, fitness instruction, content
   production, marketing, music, logistics, retail, and apparel. We
   believe that no other company is at the intersection of all these
   disciplines, which means that every day we are doing something that no
   other company has done before. This, along with the positive impact we
   have on our Members physical and mental well-being, fuels our passion
   for continuous innovation and progress.

   Growth Strategies

   Our goal is to rapidly grow our Member base through the sale of our
   Connected Fitness Products while continuing to engage and retain our
   scaled and loyal community of Members.

   Grow Brand Awareness

   We are still in the early stages of growth in our existing markets. As
   of June 30, 2019, we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness
   Products globally, a small fraction of the 14 million products we
   believe reflect our SAM. While our aided brand awareness has grown
   rapidly in the United States and reached 67% as of April 3, 2019, we
   have significant room to increase our brand and product awareness in
   both the United States and in our other geographies through television,
   digital, and social media marketing, as well as our showrooms and
   word-of-mouth referrals. We continue to broaden our demographic appeal
   by educating customers on the compelling value of our Connected Fitness
   Subscriptions.

   Continuously Improve Member Experience

   We constantly improve and evolve our interactive software and content
   to drive Member engagement, which helps us maintain our high retention
   rates as we grow. We deploy new software features frequently and
   currently produce over 950 original programs per month to keep our
   content library fresh and on-trend. We also continue to drive usage
   through innovative fitness and wellness programs and goal-based
   challenges that make Members feel more accountable and help them reach
   their personal goals. Total Workouts for our Connected Fitness
   Subscribers grew from 17.9 million in fiscal 2018 to 52.2 million in
   fiscal 2019, representing a 192% increase. For a definition of Total
   Workouts, see the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis
   of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsKey Operational and
   Business Metrics.

   Launch New Products and Expand Content Offering

   Over time, we plan to invest heavily in new product development and
   content to further penetrate our SAM. We will launch new Connected
   Fitness Products and accessories in our existing, as well as new
   fitness verticals, while continuously updating and expanding our
   original fitness and wellness programming. We will pursue new products
   where there is a large market opportunity in areas of fitness with
   staying power.

   Pursue Disciplined Expansion into New Geographies

   With more than 174 million people belonging to gyms globally, we
   believe there is significant opportunity for Peloton to grow
   internationally. In 2018, we began our international expansion and
   brought the Peloton experience to the United Kingdom and Canada. With
   our expansion into Germany in the winter of 2019, we will be in the
   largest fitness markets in the world. We will continue to pursue
   disciplined international expansion by targeting countries with high
   fitness penetration and spend, the presence of boutique fitness, and
   where we believe the Peloton value proposition will resonate.

   Invest in Our Platform

   We will continue to invest in technology and infrastructure to extend
   our leadership in connected fitness, increase our value proposition,
   and support our growth. Over the next couple of years, we will continue
   to invest in state-of-the-art production studios in New York City and
   London and a new headquarters in New York City, which will include a
   dedicated research and development facility for new product design,
   development, and testing. We will continue to invest heavily in a
   variety of software and hardware engineering functions, supply chain
   operations, manufacturing, and advanced quality assurance to support
   our growth.

   Increase Profitability Through Fixed Cost Leverage

   The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base will
   allow us to improve Subscription Contribution Margin, increase
   Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, and generate operating
   leverage. A significant portion of our content creation costs can be
   leveraged over time given that a limited number of production studios
   and instructors can support the future growth of our Subscriber base,
   which includes both our Connected Fitness and Digital Subscribers. We
   expect to drive continued efficiencies in sales and marketing expenses
   as we benefit from increasing brand awareness, word-of-mouth referrals
   from our growing Subscriber base, and further optimization of our sales
   and marketing investments by channel. We will also achieve operating
   leverage as we scale fixed general and administrative expenses,
   including those associated with our new headquarters in New York City.

                     Risks Associated with Our Business

   Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including
   those highlighted in the section titled Risk Factors immediately
   following this Prospectus Summary. Some of these risks include:


     

   We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur
   operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain
   profitability in the future;


     

   We may be unable to attract and retain Subscribers, which could have an
   adverse effect on our business and rate of growth;


     

   If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully
   develop and introduce new, innovative, and updated products and
   services in a timely manner or effectively manage the introduction of
   new or enhanced products and services, our business may be adversely
   affected;


     

   The market for our products and services is still in the early stages
   of growth and if it does not continue to grow, grows more slowly than
   we expect, or fails to grow as large as we expect, our business,
   financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected;


     

   We have a limited operating history, our past financial results may not
   be indicative of our future performance, and our revenue growth rate is
   likely to slow as our business matures;


     

   We operate in a highly competitive market and we may be unable to
   compete successfully against existing and future competitors;


     

   We derive a significant majority of our revenue from sales of our Bike
   and a decline in sales of our Bike would negatively affect our future
   revenue and operating results;


     

   We rely on a limited number of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics
   partners for our Connected Fitness Products and a loss of any of these
   partners could negatively affect our business;


     

   We have limited control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and
   logistics partners, which may subject us to significant risks,
   including the potential inability to produce or obtain quality products
   & services on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity;


     

   We depend upon third-party licenses for the use of music in our content
   and an adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold
   necessary licenses may have an adverse effect on our business,
   operating results, and financial condition;


     

   Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation
   of the Peloton brand; and


     

   The dual class structure of our common stock will have the effect of
   concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our
   capital stock prior to the completion of this offering, including our
   directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders.

                   Channels for Disclosure of Information

   Following the completion of this offering, we intend to announce
   material information to the public through filings with the Securities
   and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, the investor relations page on our

   Any updates to the list of disclosure channels through which we will
   announce information will be posted on the investor relations page on
   our website.

                            Corporate Information

   We were formed in 2012 as Peloton Interactive, LLC, a Delaware limited
   liability company. Peloton Interactive, Inc., a Delaware corporation,

   on any such information in deciding whether to purchase our Class A
   common stock. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms Peloton, Peloton
   Interactive, we, us, and our refer to Peloton Interactive, Inc.,
   together with our consolidated subsidiaries.

   Peloton, the Peloton logo, Peloton Bike, Peloton Tread, Peloton

   service marks of Peloton appearing in this prospectus are the property
   of Peloton. This prospectus contains additional trade names,

   rights, or the right of the applicable licensor, to these trademarks
   and tradenames.

              Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company

   As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our most
   recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth
   company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
   amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our
   Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth
   company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and
   other requirements that are otherwise applicable, in general, to public
   companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions
   include:


     

   not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
   of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;


     

   reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and


     

   exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote
   on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden
   parachute payments not previously approved.

   Emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised
   accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to
   private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves
   of this accommodation allowing for delayed adoption of new or revised
   accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new
   or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not
   emerging growth companies.

   We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur
   of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than
   $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (2) the date we qualify as a large
   accelerated filer, with at least $700 million of equity securities
   held by non-affiliates; (3) the date on which we have issued, in any
   three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt
   securities; and (4) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the
   fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering.

   We may take advantage of these exemptions until such time that we are
   no longer an emerging growth company. Accordingly, the information
   contained herein may be different than the information you receive from
   other public companies in which you hold stock.

                                RISK FACTORS

   Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk.
   You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described
   below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus,
   including the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of
   Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated
   financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in
   this prospectus before deciding whether to invest in shares of our
   Class A common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are
   not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we
   are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important
   factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following
   risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and
   future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that
   event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and
   you could lose part or all of your investment.

   Risks Related to Our Business

   We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur
   operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain
   profitability in the future.

   We have incurred operating losses each year since our inception in
   2012, including net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and
   $(195.6) million for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, and
   expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As a
   result, we had a total stockholders deficit of $(538.6) million at
   June 30, 2019. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the
   future as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to
   invest in research and development, expand our operating and retail
   infrastructure, add content and software features to our platform,
   expand into new geographies, and develop new Connected Fitness
   Products. Further, as a public company, we will incur additional legal,
   accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private
   company. These efforts and additional expenses may be more costly than
   we expect, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our
   revenue to offset our operating expenses. Our revenue growth may slow
   or our revenue may decline for a number of other reasons, including
   reduced demand for our products and services, increased competition, a
   decrease in the growth or reduction in size of our overall market, or
   if we cannot capitalize on growth opportunities. If our revenue does
   not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we will not be
   able to achieve and maintain profitability.

   We may be unable to attract and retain Subscribers, which could have an
   adverse effect on our business and rate of growth.

   We have experienced significant Subscriber growth over the past several
   years. Our continued business and revenue growth is dependent on our
   ability to continuously attract and retain Subscribers, and we cannot
   be sure that we will be successful in these efforts, or that Subscriber
   retention levels will not materially decline. There are a number of
   factors that could lead to a decline in Subscriber levels or that could
   prevent us from increasing our Subscriber levels, including:


     

   our failure to introduce new features, products, or services that
   Members find engaging or our introduction of new products or services,
   or changes to existing products and services that are not favorably
   received;


     

   harm to our brand and reputation;


     

   pricing and perceived value of our offerings;


     

   our inability to deliver quality products, content, and services;


     

   our Members engaging with competitive products and services;


     

   technical or other problems preventing Members from accessing our
   content and services in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise
   affecting the Member experience;


     

   unsatisfactory experiences with the delivery, installation, or service
   of our Connected Fitness Products;


     

   a decline in the publics interest in indoor cycling or running, or
   other fitness disciplines that we invest most heavily in; and


     

   deteriorating general economic conditions or a change in consumer
   spending preferences or buying trends.

   Additionally, further expansion into international markets such as
   Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany will create new challenges in
   attracting and retaining Subscribers that we may not successfully
   address. As a result of these factors, we cannot be sure that our
   Subscriber levels will be adequate to maintain or permit the expansion
   of our operations. A decline in Subscriber levels could have an adverse
   effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.


                                     15

   If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully
   develop and introduce new, innovative, and updated products and
   services in a timely manner or effectively manage the introduction of
   new or enhanced products and services, our business may be adversely
   affected.

   Our success in maintaining and increasing our Subscriber base depends
   on our ability to identify and originate trends as well as to
   anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner.
   Our products and services are subject to changing consumer preferences
   that cannot be predicted with certainty. If we are unable to introduce
   new or enhanced offerings in a timely manner, or our new or enhanced
   offerings are not accepted by our Subscribers, our competitors may
   introduce similar offerings faster than us, which could negatively
   affect our rate of growth. Moreover, our new offerings may not receive
   consumer acceptance as preferences could shift rapidly to different
   types of fitness and wellness offerings or away from these types of
   offerings altogether, and our future success depends in part on our
   ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to
   anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer
   preferences could lead to, among other things, lower subscription
   rates, lower sales, pricing pressure, lower gross margins, discounting
   of our existing Connected Fitness Products, and excess inventory
   levels. Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences,
   our ability to adequately react to and address them will partially
   depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative,
   high-quality offerings. Development of new or enhanced products and
   services may require significant time and financial investment, which
   could result in increased costs and a reduction in our profit margins.
   For example, we have historically incurred higher levels of sales and
   marketing expenses accompanying each product and service introduction.

   Moreover, we must successfully manage introductions of new or enhanced
   products and services, which could adversely impact the sales of our
   existing products and services. For instance, consumers may decide to
   purchase new or enhanced products and services instead of our existing
   products and services, which could lead to excess product inventory and
   discounting of our existing products and services.

   The market for our products and services is still in the early stages
   of growth and if it does not continue to grow, grows more slowly than
   we expect, or fails to grow as large as we expect, our business,
   financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.

   The connected fitness and wellness market is relatively new, rapidly
   growing, largely unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will sustain
   high levels of demand and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success
   depends substantially on the willingness of consumers to widely adopt
   our products and services. To be successful, we will have to educate
   consumers about our products and services through significant
   investment, and provide quality content that is superior to the content
   and experiences provided by our competitors. Additionally, the fitness
   and wellness market at large is heavily saturated, and the demand for
   and market acceptance of new products and services in the market is
   uncertain. It is difficult to predict the future growth rates, if any,
   and size of our market. We cannot assure you that our market will
   develop, that the publics interest in connected fitness and wellness
   will continue, or that our products and services will be widely
   adopted. If our market does not develop, develops more slowly than
   expected, or becomes saturated with competitors, or if our products and
   services do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial
   condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.

   We have a limited operating history and our past financial results may
   not be indicative of our future performance. Further, our revenue
   growth rate is likely to slow as our business matures.

   We began operations in 2012, shipped our first Bike in 2014, and
   shipped our first Tread in 2018. We have a limited history of
   generating revenue. As a result of our short operating history, we have
   limited financial data that can be used to evaluate our current
   business. Therefore, our historical revenue growth should not be
   considered indicative of our future performance. In particular, we have
   experienced periods of high revenue growth since we began selling our
   Bike that we do not expect to continue as our business matures.
   Estimates of future revenue growth are subject to many risks and
   uncertainties and our future revenue may differ materially from our
   projections. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks
   and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly
   changing industries, including market acceptance of our products and
   services, attracting and retaining Subscribers, and increasing
   competition and expenses as we expand our business. We cannot be sure
   that we will be successful in addressing these and other challenges we
   may face in the future, and our business may be adversely affected if
   we do not manage these risks

   successfully. In addition, we may not achieve sufficient revenue to
   attain or maintain positive cash flows from operations or profitability
   in any given period, or at all.

   We operate in a highly competitive market and we may be unable to
   compete successfully against existing and future competitors.

   Our products and services are offered in a highly competitive market.
   We face significant competition in every aspect of our business,
   including at-home fitness equipment and content, fitness clubs,
   in-studio fitness classes, and health and wellness apps. Moreover, we
   expect the competition in our market to intensify in the future as new
   and existing competitors introduce new or enhanced products and
   services that compete with ours.

   Our competitors may develop, or have already developed, products,
   features, content, services, or technologies that are similar to ours
   or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more successful
   product development efforts, create more compelling employment
   opportunities, or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive
   pricing policies. Our competitors may develop or acquire, or have
   already developed or acquired, intellectual property rights that
   significantly limit or prevent our ability to compete effectively in
   the public marketplace. In addition, our competitors may have
   significantly greater resources than us, allowing them to identify and
   capitalize more efficiently upon opportunities in new markets and
   consumer preferences and trends, quickly transition and adapt their
   products and services, devote greater resources to marketing and
   advertising, or be better positioned to withstand substantial price
   competition. If we are not able to compete effectively against our
   competitors, they may acquire and engage customers or generate revenue
   at the expense of our efforts, which could have an adverse effect on
   our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   We derive a significant majority of our revenue from sales of our Bike.
   A decline in sales of our Bike would negatively affect our future
   revenue and operating results.

   Our Connected Fitness Products are sold in highly competitive markets
   with limited barriers to entry. Introduction by competitors of
   comparable products at lower price points, a maturing product
   lifecycle, a decline in consumer spending, or other factors could
   result in a decline in our revenue derived from our Connected Fitness
   Products, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial
   condition, and operating results. Because we derive a significant
   majority of our revenue from the sales of our Bike, any material
   decline in sales of our Bike would have a pronounced impact on our
   future revenue and operating results.

   We rely on a limited number of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics
   partners for our Connected Fitness Products. A loss of any of these
   partners could negatively affect our business.

   We rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture and transport
   our Connected Fitness Products, including in some cases only a single
   supplier for some of our products and components. Our reliance on a
   limited number of manufacturers for each of our Connected Fitness
   Products increases our risks, since we do not currently have
   alternative or replacement manufacturers beyond these key parties. In
   the event of interruption from any of our manufacturers, we may not be
   able to increase capacity from other sources or develop alternate or
   secondary sources without incurring material additional costs and
   substantial delays. Furthermore, all of these manufacturers primary
   facilities are located in Taiwan. Thus, our business could be adversely
   affected if one or more of our suppliers is impacted by a natural
   disaster or other interruption at a particular location.

   If we experience a significant increase in demand for our Connected
   Fitness Products, or if we need to replace an existing supplier or
   partner, we may be unable to supplement or replace them on terms that
   are acceptable to us, which may undermine our ability to deliver our
   products to Members in a timely manner. For example, it may take a
   significant amount of time to identify a manufacturer that has the
   capability and resources to build our products to our specifications in
   sufficient volume. Identifying suitable suppliers, manufacturers, and
   logistics partners is an extensive process that requires us to become
   satisfied with their quality control, technical capabilities,
   responsiveness and service, financial stability, regulatory compliance,
   and labor and other ethical practices. Accordingly, a loss of any of
   our significant suppliers, manufactures, or logistics partners could
   have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
   operating results.

   We have limited control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and
   logistics partners, which may subject us to significant risks,
   including the potential inability to produce or obtain quality products
   and services on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.

   We have limited control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and
   logistics partners, which subjects us to risks, such as the following:


     

   inability to satisfy demand for our Connected Fitness Products;


     

   reduced control over delivery timing and product reliability;


     

   reduced ability to monitor the manufacturing process and components
   used in our Connected Fitness Products;


     

   limited ability to develop comprehensive manufacturing specifications
   that take into account any materials shortages or substitutions;


     

   variance in the manufacturing capability of our third-party
   manufacturers;


     

   price increases;


     

   failure of a significant supplier, manufacturer, or logistics partner
   to perform its obligations to us for technical, market, or other
   reasons;


     

   variance in the quality of last mile services provided by our
   third-party logistics partners;

   difficulties in establishing additional supplier, manufacturer, or
   logistics partner relationships if we experience difficulties with our
   existing suppliers, manufacturers, or logistics partners;


     

   shortages of materials or components;


     

   misappropriation of our intellectual property;


     

   exposure to natural catastrophes, political unrest, terrorism, labor
   disputes, and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade
   from foreign countries in which our Connected Fitness Products are
   manufactured or the components thereof are sourced;


     

   changes in local economic conditions in the jurisdictions where our
   suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners are located;


     

   the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to
   labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties,
   tariffs, taxes, and other charges on imports, as well as trade
   restrictions and restrictions on currency exchange or the transfer of
   funds; and


     

   insufficient warranties and indemnities on components supplied to our
   manufacturers or performance by our partners.

   We also rely on our logistics partners, including last mile warehouse
   and delivery partners, to complete a substantial percentage of our
   deliveries to customers, with the rest of the deliveries handled by our
   own last mile team. Our primary last mile partner relies on a network
   of independent contractors to perform last mile services for us in many
   markets. If any of these independent contractors, or the last mile
   partner as a whole, do not perform their obligations or meet the
   expectations of us or our Members, our reputation and business could
   suffer.

   The occurrence of any of these risks, especially during seasons of peak
   demand, could cause us to experience a significant disruption in our
   ability to produce and deliver our products to our customers.

   We depend upon third-party licenses for the use of music in our
   content. An adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold
   necessary licenses may have an adverse effect on our business,
   operating results, and financial condition.

   Music is an important element of the overall content that we make
   available to our Members. To secure the rights to use music in our
   content, we enter into agreements to obtain licenses from rights
   holders such as record labels, music publishers, performing rights
   organizations, collecting societies, artists, and other copyright
   owners or their agents. We pay royalties to such parties or their
   agents around the world.

   The process of obtaining licenses involves identifying and negotiating
   with many rights holders, some of whom are unknown or difficult to
   identify, and implicates a myriad of complex and evolving legal issues
   across many jurisdictions, including open questions of law as to when
   and whether particular licenses are needed. Rights holders also may
   attempt to


                                     18
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   take advantage of their market power to seek onerous financial terms
   from us. Our relationship with certain rights holders may deteriorate.
   Artists and/or artist groups may object and may exert public or private
   pressure on rights holders to discontinue or to modify license terms.
   Additionally, there is a risk that aspiring rights holders, their
   agents, or legislative or regulatory bodies will create or attempt to
   create new rights that could require us to enter into new license
   agreements with, and pay royalties to, newly defined groups of rights
   holders, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify.

   With respect to musical compositions, in addition to obtaining
   publishing rights, we generally need to obtain separate public
   performance rights. In the United States, public performance rights are
   typically obtained through intermediaries known as performing rights
   organizations, or PROs, which (a) issue blanket licenses with copyright
   users for the public performance of compositions in their repertory,
   (b) collect royalties under those licenses, and (c) distribute such
   royalties to copyright owners. We have agreements with each of the
   following PROs in the United States: the American Society of Composers,
   Authors and Publishers, or ASCAP, and Broadcast Music, Inc., or BMI,
   Global Music Rights, and SESAC. The royalty rates available to us from
   the PROs today may not be available to us in the future. Licenses
   provided by ASCAP and BMI currently are governed by consent decrees,
   which were issued by the U.S. Department of Justice in an effort to
   curb anti-competitive conduct. Removal of or changes to the terms or
   interpretation of these agreements could affect our ability to obtain
   licenses from these PROs on current and/or otherwise favorable terms,
   which could harm our business, operating results, and financial
   condition.

   In other parts of the world, including in Canada and Europe, we obtain
   licenses for musical compositions either through local collecting
   societies representing publishers, or from publishers directly, or a
   combination thereof. We cannot guarantee that our licenses with
   collecting societies and our direct licenses with publishers provide
   full coverage for all of the musical compositions we use in our service
   in the countries in which we operate, or that we may enter in the
   future. Publishers, songwriters, and other rights holders who choose
   not to be represented by major or independent publishing companies or
   collecting societies have, and could in the future, adversely impact
   our ability to secure licensing arrangements in connection with musical
   compositions that such rights holders own or control, and could
   increase the risk of liability for copyright infringement.

   Although we expend significant resources to seek to comply with the
   statutory, regulatory, and judicial frameworks, we cannot guarantee
   that we currently hold, or will always hold, every necessary right to
   use all of the music that is used on our service, and we cannot assure
   you that we are not infringing or violating any third-party
   intellectual property rights, or that we will not do so in the future.

   These challenges, and others concerning the licensing of music on our
   platform, may subject us to significant liability for copyright
   infringement, breach of contract, or other claims. For additional
   information, see the section titled BusinessLegal Proceedings.

   Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation
   of the Peloton brand.

   We believe that our brand is important to attracting and retaining
   Members. Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our brand depends
   largely on the success of our marketing efforts, ability to provide
   consistent, high-quality products, services, features, content, and
   support, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend
   our rights to use the Peloton mark, our P logo, and other
   trademarks important to our brand. We believe that the importance of
   our brand will increase as competition further intensifies and brand
   promotion activities may require substantial expenditures. Our brand
   could be harmed if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public
   image were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Unfavorable publicity
   about us, including our products, services, technology, customer
   service, content, personnel, and suppliers could diminish confidence
   in, and the use of, our products and services. Such negative publicity
   also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement and loyalty
   of our Member base and result in decreased revenue, which could have an
   adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating
   results.

   We have grown rapidly in recent years and have limited operating
   experience at our current scale of operations. If we are unable to
   manage our growth effectively, our brand, company culture, and
   financial performance may suffer.

   We have expanded our operations rapidly and have limited operating
   experience at our current size. For example, between June 30, 2017 and
   June 30, 2019, our employee headcount increased from 443 to 1,950, and
   we expect headcount growth


                                     19

   to continue for the foreseeable future. Further, as we grow, our
   business becomes increasingly complex. To effectively manage and
   capitalize on our growth, we must continue to expand our sales and
   marketing, focus on innovative product and content development, upgrade
   our management information systems and other processes, and obtain more
   space for our expanding staff. Our continued growth could strain our
   existing resources, and we could experience ongoing operating
   difficulties in managing our business across numerous jurisdictions,
   including difficulties in hiring, training, and managing a diffuse and
   growing employee base. Failure to scale and preserve our company
   culture with growth could harm our future success, including our
   ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and
   pursue our corporate objectives. Moreover, the vertically integrated
   nature of our business, where we design our own Connected Fitness
   Products, develop our own software, produce original fitness and
   wellness programming, sell our products exclusively through our own
   sales teams and e-commerce site, and deliver and service our Connected
   Fitness Products, exposes us to risk and disruption at many points that
   are critical to successfully operating our business and may make it
   more difficult for us to scale our business. If we do not adapt to meet
   these evolving challenges, or if our management team does not
   effectively scale with our growth, we may experience erosion to our
   brand, the quality of our products and services may suffer, and our
   company culture may be harmed.

   Our growth strategy contemplates a significant increase in our
   advertising and other marketing spending and expanding our retail
   showroom presence. Many of our existing retail showrooms are relatively
   new and we cannot assure you that these showrooms or that future
   showrooms will generate revenue and cash flow comparable with those
   generated by our more mature locations, especially as we move to new
   geographic markets. Further, many of our retail showrooms are leased
   pursuant to multi-year short-term leases, and our ability to negotiate
   favorable terms on an expiring lease or for a lease renewal option may
   depend on factors that are not within our control. We may also open
   additional production studios as we expand internationally, which will
   require significant additional investment. Successful implementation of
   our growth strategy will require significant expenditures before any
   substantial associated revenue is generated and we cannot guarantee
   that these increased investments will result in corresponding and
   offsetting revenue growth.

   Because we have a limited history operating our business at its current
   scale, it is difficult to evaluate our current business and future
   prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth.
   Our limited operating experience at this scale, combined with the
   rapidly evolving nature of the market in which we sell our products and
   services, substantial uncertainty concerning how these markets may
   develop, and other economic factors beyond our control, reduces our
   ability to accurately forecast quarterly or annual revenue. Failure to
   manage our future growth effectively could have an adverse effect on
   our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   We cannot compel third parties to license their music to us, and our
   business may be adversely affected if our access to music is limited.
   The concentration of control of content by major music licensors means
   that the actions of one or a few licensors may adversely affect our
   ability to provide our service.

   We enter into license agreements to obtain rights to use music in our
   service, including with major record companies (Sony Music
   Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group),
   independent record labels, major music publishers (Sony/ATV Music
   Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner/Chappell
   Music), and independent music publishers and administrators who
   collectively hold the rights to a significant number of sound
   recordings and musical compositions.

   Comprehensive and accurate ownership information for the musical
   compositions embodied in sound recordings is sometimes unavailable, or
   in some cases, impossible to obtain if withheld by the owners or
   administrators of such rights. In some cases, we obtain ownership
   information directly from music publishers, and in other cases we rely
   on the assistance of third parties to determine ownership information.

   If the information provided to us or obtained by such third parties
   does not comprehensively or accurately identify the ownership of
   musical compositions, or if we are unable to determine which musical
   compositions correspond to specific sound recordings, it becomes
   difficult or impossible to identify the appropriate rights holders to
   whom to pay royalties. This may make it difficult to comply with the
   obligations of any agreements with those rights holders or to secure
   the appropriate licenses with all necessary parties.

   Given the high level of content concentration in the music industry,
   the market power of a few licensors, and the lack of transparent
   ownership information for compositions, we may be unable to license a
   large amount of music or the music of certain popular artists, and our
   business, financial condition, and operating results could be
   materially harmed.


                                     20

   We are a party to many music license agreements that are complex and
   impose numerous obligations upon us that may make it difficult to
   operate our business, and a breach of such agreements could adversely
   affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

   Our license agreements are complex and impose numerous obligations on
   us, including obligations to, among other things:


     

   calculate and make payments based on complex royalty structures, which
   requires tracking usage of content in our service that may have
   inaccurate or incomplete metadata necessary for such calculation;


     

   provide periodic reports on the exploitation of the content in
   specified formats;


     

   represent that we will obtain all necessary publishing licenses and
   consents and pay all associated fees, royalties, and other amounts due
   for the licensing of musical compositions;


     

   comply with certain marketing and advertising restrictions;


     

   grant the licensor the right to audit our compliance with the terms of
   such agreements; and


     

   comply with certain security and technical specifications.

   Certain of our license agreements also contain minimum guarantees or
   require that we make minimum guarantee or advance payments, which are
   not always tied to our number of Subscribers or stream counts for music
   used in our service. Accordingly, our ability to achieve and sustain
   profitability and operating leverage in part depends on our ability to
   increase our revenue through increased sales of Subscriptions on terms
   that maintain an adequate gross margin. Our license agreements that
   contain minimum guarantees typically have terms of between one and
   three years, but our Subscribers may cancel their subscriptions at any
   time. We rely on estimates to forecast whether such minimum guarantees
   and advances against royalties could be recouped against our actual
   content costs incurred over the term of the license agreement. To the
   extent that our estimates underperform relative to our expectations,
   and our content costs do not exceed such minimum guarantees and advance
   payments, our margins may be adversely affected.

   Some of our license agreements also include so-called most-favored
   nations provisions, which require that certain terms (including
   material financial terms) are no less favorable than those provided to
   any similarly situated licensor. If agreements are amended or new
   agreements are entered into on more favorable terms, these most-favored
   nations provisions could cause our payment or other obligations to
   escalate substantially. Additionally, some of our license agreements
   require consent to undertake new business initiatives utilizing the
   licensed content (e.g., alternative distribution models), and without
   such consent, our ability to undertake new business initiatives may be
   limited and our competitive position could be impacted.

   If we breach any obligations in any of our license agreements, or if we
   use content in ways that are found to exceed the scope of such
   agreements, we could be subject to monetary penalties or claims of
   infringement, and our rights under such agreements could be terminated.

   In the past, we have entered into agreements that required us to make
   substantial payments to licensors to resolve instances of past use at
   the same time that we enter into go-forward licenses. These agreements
   may also include most-favored nations provisions. If triggered, these
   most favored nations provisions could cause our payments or other
   obligations under those agreements to escalate substantially. If we
   need to enter into additional similar agreements in the future, it
   could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
   condition, and operating results.

   Our business is affected by seasonality.

   Our business has historically been influenced by seasonal trends common
   to traditional retail selling periods, and we generate a
   disproportionate amount of sales activity related to our Connected
   Fitness Products during the period from November through February due
   in large part to seasonal holiday demand, New Years resolutions, and
   cold weather. For example, we generated approximately 64%, 63%, and 63%
   of our full fiscal year total revenue during the second and third
   quarters of fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Accordingly,
   adverse events that occur during these months could have a
   disproportionate effect on our operating results for the entire fiscal
   year. Moreover, as a result of higher sales during the period from
   November through February, our working capital needs are greater during
   the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. As a result of
   quarterly fluctuations caused by these and other factors, comparisons
   of our operating results


                                     21
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   across different fiscal quarters may not be accurate indicators of our
   future performance. Furthermore, our rapid growth in recent years may
   obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our
   business and may continue to affect our business. Accordingly, yearly
   or quarterly comparisons of our operating results may not be useful and
   our results in any particular period will not necessarily be indicative
   of the results to be expected for any future period. Seasonality in our
   business can also be affected by introductions of new or enhanced
   products and services, including the costs associated with such
   introductions.

   Our passion and focus on delivering a high-quality and engaging Peloton
   experience may not maximize short-term financial results, which may
   yield results that conflict with the markets expectations and could
   result in our stock price being negatively affected.

   We are passionate about continually enhancing the Peloton experience
   with a focus on driving long-term Member engagement through innovation,
   immersive content, technologically advanced Connected Fitness Products,
   and community support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term
   financial results. We frequently make business decisions that may
   reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the
   decisions are consistent with our goals to improve the Peloton
   experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over
   the long term. These decisions may not be consistent with the
   short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the
   long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our membership growth
   and Member engagement, and our business, financial condition, and
   operating results could be harmed.

   Our products and services may be affected from time to time by design
   and manufacturing defects that could adversely affect our business and
   result in harm to our reputation.

   We offer complex hardware and software products and services that can
   be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated
   operating system software and applications, such as those offered by
   us, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended
   operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in
   components and products that we source from third parties. Any such
   defects could make our products and services unsafe, create a risk of
   environmental or property damage and personal injury, and subject us to
   the hazards and uncertainties of product liability claims and related
   litigation. In addition, from time to time we may experience outages,
   service slowdowns, or errors that affect our fitness and wellness
   programming. As a result, our services may not perform as anticipated
   and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance that
   we will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the
   hardware, software, and services we offer. Failure to do so could
   result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting our
   products and services and could lead to claims against us. We maintain
   general liability insurance; however, design and manufacturing defects,
   and claims related thereto, may subject us to judgments or settlements
   that result in damages materially in excess of the limits of our
   insurance coverage. In addition, we may be exposed to recalls, product
   replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant
   and equipment, or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other
   expenses such as litigation costs and regulatory fines. If we cannot
   successfully defend any large claim, maintain our general liability
   insurance on acceptable terms, or maintain adequate coverage against
   potential claims, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
   Further, quality problems could adversely affect the experience for
   users of our products and services, and result in harm to our
   reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance,
   reduced demand for our products and services, delay in new product and
   service introductions, and lost revenue.

   If we fail to offer high-quality Member support, our business and
   reputation will suffer.

   Once our Connected Fitness Products are purchased, our Members rely on
   our high-touch delivery and set up service to deliver and install their
   equipment in a professional and efficient manner. Our Members also rely
   on our support services to resolve any issues related to the use of our
   Connected Fitness Products and content. Providing a high-quality Member
   experience is vital to our success in generating word-of-mouth
   referrals to drive sales and for retaining existing Members. The
   importance of high-quality support will increase as we expand our
   business and introduce new products and services. If we do not help our
   Members quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support,
   our reputation may suffer and our ability to retain and attract
   Members, or to sell additional products and services to existing
   Members, could be harmed.

   Our quarterly operating results and other operating metrics may
   fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes these metrics difficult
   to predict.

   Our quarterly operating results and other operating metrics have
   fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to
   quarter. Additionally, our limited operating history makes it difficult
   to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely on our
   past quarterly operating results as indicators of future performance.
   You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently
   encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial
   condition and operating results in any given quarter can be influenced
   by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are
   outside of our control, including:


     

   the continued market acceptance of, and the growth of the connected
   fitness and wellness market;


     

   our ability to maintain and attract new Subscribers;


     

   our development and improvement of the quality of the Peloton
   experience, including, enhancing existing and creating new Connected
   Fitness Products, services, technology, features, and content;


     

   the continued development and upgrading of our proprietary technology
   platform;


     

   the timing and success of new product, service, feature, and content
   introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the
   competitive landscape of our market;


     

   pricing pressure as a result of competition or otherwise;


     

   delays or disruptions in our supply chain;


     

   errors in our forecasting of the demand for our products and services,
   which could lead to lower revenue or increased costs, or both;


     

   increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may
   incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;


     

   the ability to maintain and open new showrooms;


     

   the continued maintenance and expansion of last mile delivery and
   maintenance services for our Connected Fitness Products;


     

   successful expansion into international markets, including Canada, the
   United Kingdom, and Germany;


     

   seasonal fluctuations in subscriptions and usage of Connected Fitness
   Products by our Members, each of which may change as our products and
   services evolve or as our business grows;


     

   the diversification and growth of our revenue sources;


     

   our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;


     

   constraints on the availability of consumer financing or increased down
   payment requirements to finance purchases of our Connected Fitness
   Products;


     

   system failures or breaches of security or privacy;


     

   adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related
   costs, including content costs for past use;


     

   changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with
   respect to privacy, consumer product safety, and advertising, or
   enforcement by government regulators, including fines, orders, or
   consent decrees;


     

   fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion
   of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;


     

   changes in our effective tax rate;


     

   changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations,
   or principles; and


     

   changes in business or macroeconomic conditions, including lower
   consumer confidence, recessionary conditions, increased unemployment
   rates, or stagnant or declining wages.

   Any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the
   factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our operating
   results.

   The variability and unpredictability of our quarterly operating results
   or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our
   expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with
   respect to revenue or other operating results for a particular period.
   If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our
   Class A common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly
   lawsuits, including securities class action suits.

   We rely on access to our production studios and the creativity of our
   fitness instructors to generate our class content. If we are unable to
   access or use our studios or if we are unable to attract and retain
   high-quality fitness instructors, we may not be able to generate
   interesting and attractive content for our classes.

   All of the fitness and wellness content offered on our platform is
   produced in one of our four production studios, three of which are
   located in New York City. Due to our reliance on a limited number of
   studios in a concentrated location, any incident involving our studios,
   or affecting New York City at-large, could render our studios
   inaccessible or unusable and could inhibit our ability to produce and
   deliver new fitness and wellness content for our Members. Production of
   the fitness and wellness content on our platform is further reliant on
   the creativity of our fitness instructors who, with the support of our
   production team, plan and lead our classes. Our standard employment
   contract with our fitness instructors has a fixed, multi-year term,
   however, our instructors may leave Peloton prior to the end of their
   contracts. If we are unable to attract or retain creative and
   experienced instructors, we may not be able to generate content on a
   scale or of a quality sufficient to grow our business. If we fail to
   produce and provide our Members with interesting and attractive content
   led by instructors who they can relate to, then our business, financial
   condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.

   We plan to expand into international markets, which will expose us to
   significant risks.

   We are currently expanding our operations to other countries, which
   requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us
   to regulatory, economic, and political risks in addition to those we
   already face in the United States. There are significant risks and
   costs inherent in doing business in international markets, including:


     

   difficulty establishing and managing international operations and the
   increased operations, travel, infrastructure, including establishment
   of local delivery service and customer service operations, and legal
   compliance costs associated with locations in different countries or
   regions;


     

   the need to vary pricing and margins to effectively compete in
   international markets;


     

   the need to adapt and localize products for specific countries,
   including obtaining rights to third-party intellectual property,
   including music, used in each country;


     

   increased competition from local providers of similar products and
   services;


     

   the ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights abroad;


     

   the need to offer content and customer support in various languages;


     

   difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws,
   regulations, and customs in other jurisdictions;


     

   compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
   Practices Act, or FCPA, and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or U.K. Bribery
   Act, by us, our employees, and our business partners;


     

   complexity and other risks associated with current and future legal
   requirements in other countries, including legal requirements related
   to consumer protection, consumer product safety, and data privacy
   frameworks, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation;


     

   varying levels of internet technology adoption and infrastructure, and
   increased or varying network and hosting service provider costs;


     

   tariffs and other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas and local content
   rules, as well as tax consequences;


     

   fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the requirements of
   currency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit
   conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars; and


     

   political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific
   country or region in which we operate, including, for example, the
   effects of Brexit, which could have an adverse impact on our
   operations in that location.

   We have limited experience with international regulatory environments
   and market practices and may not be able to penetrate or successfully
   operate in the markets we choose to enter. In addition, we may incur
   significant expenses as a result of our international expansion, and we
   may not be successful. We may face limited brand recognition in certain
   parts of the world that could lead to non-acceptance or delayed
   acceptance of our products and services by consumers in new markets. We
   may also face challenges to acceptance of our fitness and wellness
   content in new markets. Our failure to successfully manage these risks
   could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on
   our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   Increases in component costs, long lead times, supply shortages, and
   supply changes could disrupt our supply chain and have an adverse
   effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   Meeting customer demand partially depends on our ability to obtain
   timely and adequate delivery of components for our Connected Fitness
   Products. All of the components that go into the manufacturing of our
   Connected Fitness Products are sourced from a limited number of
   third-party suppliers, and some of these components are provided by a
   single supplier. Our manufacturers generally purchase these components
   on our behalf, subject to certain approved supplier lists, and we do
   not have long-term arrangements with most of our component suppliers.
   We are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times
   in the supply of these components and the risk that our suppliers
   discontinue or modify components used in our Connected Fitness
   Products. In addition, the lead times associated with certain
   components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in design,
   quantities, and delivery schedules. We may in the future experience
   component shortages, and the predictability of the availability of
   these components may be limited. In the event of a component shortage
   or supply interruption from suppliers of these components, we may not
   be able to develop alternate sources in a timely manner. Developing
   alternate sources of supply for these components may be time-consuming,
   difficult, and costly and we may not be able to source these components
   on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which may undermine our
   ability to fill our orders in a timely manner. Any interruption or
   delay in the supply of any of these parts or components, or the
   inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at
   acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, would harm
   our ability to meet our scheduled Connected Fitness Product deliveries
   to our customers.

   Moreover, volatile economic conditions may make it more likely that our
   suppliers may be unable to timely deliver supplies, or at all, and
   there is no guarantee that we will be able to timely locate alternative
   suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Further, since
   the beginning of 2018, there has been increasing rhetoric, in some
   cases coupled with legislative or executive action, from several U.S.
   and foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of
   certain materials. Several of the components that go into the
   manufacturing of our Connected Fitness Products are sourced
   internationally, including from China, where the United States has
   imposed tariffs on specified products imported therefrom following the
   U.S. Trade Representative Section 301 Investigation. These tariffs have
   an impact on our component costs and have the potential to have an even
   greater impact depending on the outcome of the current trade
   negotiations, which have been protracted and recently resulted in
   increases in U.S. tariff rates on specified products from China.
   Increases in our component costs could have a material effect on our
   gross margins. The loss of a significant supplier, an increase in
   component costs, or delays or disruptions in the delivery of
   components, could adversely impact our ability to generate future
   revenue and earnings and have an adverse effect on our business,
   financial condition, and operating results.

   Any major disruption or failure of our information technology systems
   or websites, or our failure to successfully implement upgrades and new
   technology effectively, could adversely affect our business and
   operations.

   Certain of our information technology systems are designed and
   maintained by us and are critical for the efficient functioning of our
   business, including the manufacture and distribution of our Connected
   Fitness Products, online sales of our Connected Fitness Products, and
   the ability of our Members to access content on our platform. Our rapid
   growth has, in certain instances, strained these systems. As we grow,
   we continue to implement modifications and upgrades to our systems, and
   these activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with
   replacing and upgrading these systems, including, but not limited to,
   impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders and other
   disruptions in our business operations. Further, our system
   implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level
   that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. If we fail to
   successfully implement modifications and upgrades or expand the
   functionality of our information technology systems, we could
   experience increased costs associated with diminished productivity and
   operating inefficiencies related to the flow of goods through our
   supply chain.

   In addition, any unexpected technological interruptions to our systems
   or websites would disrupt our operations, including our ability to
   timely ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements,
   manage our supply chain, sell our Connected Fitness Products online,
   provide services to our Members, and otherwise adequately serve our
   Members.

   Online sales of our Connected Fitness Products through
   www.onepeloton.com represented over 50% of our units sold in the U.S.
   for fiscal 2019. The operation of our direct to consumer e-commerce
   business through our website depends on our ability to maintain the
   efficient and uninterrupted operation of online order-taking and
   fulfillment operations. Any system interruptions or delays could
   prevent potential customers from purchasing our Connected Fitness
   Products.

   Moreover, the ability of our Members to access the content on our
   platform could be diminished by a number of factors, including Members
   inability to access the internet, the failure of our network or
   software systems, security breaches, or variability in Member traffic
   for our platform. Platform failures would be most impactful if they
   occurred during peak platform use periods, which generally occur before
   and after standard work hours. During these peak periods, there are a
   significant number of Members concurrently accessing our platform and
   if we are unable to provide uninterrupted access, our Members
   perception of our platforms reliability may be damaged, our revenue
   could be reduced, our reputation could be harmed, and we may be
   required to issue credits or refunds, or risk losing Members.

   In the event we experience significant disruptions, we may be unable to
   repair our systems in an efficient and timely manner which could have a
   material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
   operating results.

   Our operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to
   accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and services and
   adequately manage our inventory.

   To ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs
   and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with our
   suppliers and manufacturers, based on our estimates of future demand
   for particular products and services. Failure to accurately forecast
   our needs may result in manufacturing delays or increased costs. Our
   ability to accurately forecast demand could be affected by many
   factors, including changes in consumer demand for our products and
   services, changes in demand for the products and services of our
   competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and
   the weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future
   economic conditions. This risk may be exacerbated by the fact that we
   may not carry a significant amount of inventory and may not be able to
   satisfy short-term demand increases. If we fail to accurately forecast
   consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a
   shortage of products available for sale.

   Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory
   write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at
   discounted prices, which would cause our gross margins to suffer and
   could impair the strength and premium nature of our brand. Further,
   lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing
   capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies, which could result in
   lower margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand, our
   suppliers and manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet
   our requirements or we may be subject to higher costs in order to
   secure the necessary production capacity. An inability to meet consumer
   demand and delays in the delivery of our products to our customers
   could result in reputational harm and damaged customer relationships
   and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
   operating results.

   If we are unable to sustain pricing levels for our Connected Fitness
   Products and subscriptions, our business could be adversely affected.

   If we are unable to sustain pricing levels for our Bike, Tread, and
   subscription services, whether due to competitive pressure or
   otherwise, our gross margins could be significantly reduced. Further,
   our decisions around the development of new products and services are
   grounded in assumptions about eventual pricing levels. If there is
   price compression in the market after these decisions are made, it
   could have a negative effect on our business.

   Our revenue could decline due to changes in credit markets and
   decisions made by credit providers.

   Historically, a majority of our customers have financed their purchase
   of our Connected Fitness Products through third-party credit providers
   with whom we have existing relationships. If we are unable to maintain
   our relationships with our financing partners, there is no guarantee
   that we will be able to find replacement partners who will provide our
   customers with financing on similar terms, and our ability to sell our
   Connected Fitness Products may be adversely affected. Further,
   reductions in consumer lending and the availability of consumer credit
   could limit the number of customers with the financial means to
   purchase our products. Higher interest rates could increase our costs
   or the monthly payments for consumer products financed through other
   sources of consumer financing. In the future, we cannot be assured that
   third-party financing providers will continue to provide consumers with
   access to credit or that available credit limits will not be reduced.
   Such restrictions or reductions in the availability of consumer credit,
   or the loss of our relationship with our current financing partners,
   could have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, and
   operating results.

   Our future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key
   employees and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled
   personnel and senior management.

   Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to
   identify, attract, develop, integrate, and retain qualified and highly
   skilled personnel, including senior management, engineers, producers,
   designers, product managers, logistics and supply chain personnel,
   retail managers, and fitness instructors. In particular, we are highly
   dependent on the services of John Foley, our Chief Executive Officer
   and co-founder, who is critical to the development of our business,
   future vision, and strategic direction. We also heavily rely on the
   continued service and performance of our senior management team, which
   provides leadership, contributes to the core areas of our business and
   helps us to efficiently execute our business. Also imperative to our
   success are our fitness instructors, who we rely on to bring new,
   exciting, and innovative fitness and wellness content to our platform,
   and who act as brand ambassadors. If the senior management team,
   including any new hires that we make, fails to work together
   effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis
   then our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.

   Additionally, the loss of any key personnel could make it more
   difficult to manage our operations and research and development
   activities, reduce our employee retention and revenue, and impair our
   ability to compete. Although we have entered into employment offer
   letters with our key personnel, these agreements have no specific
   duration and constitute at-will employment. We do not maintain key
   person life insurance policies on any of our employees.

   Competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense, especially
   in New York City, where we have a substantial presence and need for
   highly skilled personnel. We may not be successful in attracting,
   integrating, or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or
   future needs. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to
   continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly
   skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, job
   candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the
   equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the
   perceived value of our Class A common stock declines, it may adversely
   affect our ability to hire or retain highly skilled employees. In
   addition, we may periodically change our equity compensation practices,
   which may include reducing the number of employees eligible for equity
   awards or reducing the size of equity awards granted per employee. If
   we are unable to attract, integrate, or retain the qualified and highly
   skilled personnel required to fulfill our current or future needs, our
   business and future growth prospects could be harmed.

   If we cannot maintain our One Peloton culture as we grow, we could
   lose the innovation, teamwork, and passion that we believe contribute
   to our success and our business may be harmed.

   We believe that a critical component of our success has been our
   corporate culture. We have invested substantial time and resources in
   building our One Peloton culture, which is based on the idea that if
   we work together, we will be more efficient and perform better because
   of one another. As we continue to grow, including geographically
   expanding our presence outside of our headquarters in New York City,
   and developing the infrastructure associated with being a public
   company, we will need to maintain our One Peloton culture among a
   larger number of employees, dispersed across various geographic
   regions. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect
   our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit
   personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate
   objectives.

   We have a limited operating history with which to evaluate and predict
   the profitability of our subscription model. Additionally, we may
   introduce new revenue models in the future.

   The majority of our Subscribers are on month-to-month subscription
   terms and may cancel their subscriptions at any time. We have limited
   historical data with respect to rates of Subscriber subscription
   renewals, so we may be unable to accurately predict customer renewal
   rates. Additionally, prior renewal rates may not accurately predict
   future Subscriber renewal rates for a variety of reasons, such as
   Subscribers dissatisfaction with our offerings and the cost of our
   subscriptions, macroeconomic conditions, or new offering introductions
   by us or our competitors. If our Subscribers do not renew their
   subscriptions, our revenue may decline and our business will suffer.

   Furthermore, in the future, we may offer new subscription products,
   implement promotions, or replace or modify current subscription models,
   any of which could result in additional costs. It is unknown how our
   Subscribers will react to new models and whether the costs or logistics
   of implementing these models will adversely impact our business. If the
   adoption of new revenue models adversely impacts our Subscriber
   relationships, then Subscriber growth, Subscriber engagement, and our
   business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.

   Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to
   protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and
   brand.

   Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology and our
   patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and other intellectual property
   rights. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, a combination of
   trademark, trade dress, domain name, copyright, trade secret and patent
   laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our
   employees, contractors, consultants, and third parties with whom we
   have relationships, to establish and protect our brand and other
   intellectual property rights. However, our efforts to protect our
   intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective, and
   any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, which could
   result in them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid or
   unenforceable. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property
   rights will be sufficient to protect against others offering products,
   services, or technologies that are substantially similar to ours and
   that compete with our business.

   Effective protection of patents, trademarks, and domain names is
   expensive and difficult to maintain, both in terms of application and
   registration costs as well as the costs of defending and enforcing
   those rights. As we have grown, we have sought to obtain and protect
   our intellectual property rights in an increasing number of countries,
   a process that can be expensive and may not always be successful. For
   example, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign
   governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of
   procedural requirements to complete the patent application process and
   to maintain issued patents, and noncompliance or non-payment could
   result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application,
   resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in a relevant
   jurisdiction. Further, intellectual property protection may not be
   available to us in every country in which our products and services are
   available. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory
   licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third
   parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of
   patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or
   government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited
   or no benefit.

   In order to protect our brand and intellectual property rights, we may
   be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these
   rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual
   property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to
   management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of
   our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our
   intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims,
   and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our
   intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we may not be able to
   prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our
   intellectual property. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our
   intellectual property rights could seriously damage our brand and our
   business.

   We have been, and in the future may be, sued by third parties for
   alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.

   There is considerable patent and other intellectual property
   development activity in our market, and litigation, based on
   allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual
   property, is frequent in the fitness and technology industries.
   Furthermore, it is common for individuals and groups to purchase
   patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of
   making claims of infringement to extract settlements from companies
   like ours. Our use of third-party content, including music content,
   software, and other intellectual property rights may be subject to
   claims of infringement or misappropriation. We cannot guarantee that
   our internally developed or acquired technologies and content do not or
   will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. From time
   to time, our competitors or other third parties may claim that we are
   infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights,
   and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. Any claims or
   litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if
   successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial
   damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our
   platform or services or using certain technologies, force us to
   implement expensive work-arounds, or impose other unfavorable terms. We
   expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as
   the market for fitness products and services grows. Accordingly, our
   exposure to damages resulting from infringement claims could increase
   and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources.
   Further, during the course of any litigation, we may make announcements
   regarding the results of hearings and motions, and other interim
   developments. If securities analysts and investors regard these
   announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock
   may decline. Even if intellectual property claims do not result in
   litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and
   resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our
   management and require significant expenditures. Any of the foregoing
   could prevent us from competing effectively and could have an adverse
   effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.


                                     28

   We rely heavily on third parties for most of our computing, storage,
   processing, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference
   with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect
   on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   We have outsourced our cloud infrastructure to third-party providers,
   and we currently use these providers to host and stream our services
   and content. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions
   experienced by these providers and we expect to experience
   interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future
   due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human,
   hardware or software errors, hosting disruptions, and capacity
   constraints. Outages and capacity constraints could arise from a number
   of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or
   security attacks. The level of service provided by these providers, or
   regular or prolonged interruptions in that service, could also affect
   the use of, and our Members satisfaction with, our products and
   services and could harm our business and reputation. In addition,
   hosting costs will increase as membership engagement grows, which could
   harm our business if we are unable to grow our revenue faster than the
   cost of using these services or the services of similar providers.

   Furthermore, our providers have broad discretion to change and
   interpret the terms of service and other policies with respect to us,
   and those actions may be unfavorable to our business operations. Our
   providers may also take actions beyond our control that could seriously
   harm our business, including discontinuing or limiting our access to
   one or more services, increasing pricing terms, terminating or seeking
   to terminate our contractual relationship altogether, or altering how
   we are able to process data in a way that is unfavorable or costly to
   us. Although we expect that we could obtain similar services from other
   third parties, if our arrangements with our current providers were
   terminated, we could experience interruptions on our platform and in
   our ability to make our content available to Members, as well as delays
   and additional expenses in arranging for alternative cloud
   infrastructure services.

   Any of these factors could further reduce our revenue, subject us to
   liability, and cause our Subscribers to decline to renew their
   subscriptions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition, and operating results.

   In addition, customers of certain of our providers have been subject to
   litigation by third parties claiming that the service and basic HTTP
   functions infringe their patents. If we become subject to such claims,
   although we expect our provider to indemnify us with respect to at
   least a portion of such claims, the litigation may be time consuming,
   divert managements attention, and, if our provider failed to indemnify
   us, adversely impact our operating results.

   We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in
   connection with content we produce, license, and distribute through our
   platform.

   As a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability
   for negligence, copyright, and trademark infringement, or other claims
   based on the nature and content of materials that we produce, license,
   and distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used
   in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We may decide
   to remove content from our service, not to place certain content on our
   service, or to discontinue or alter our production of certain types of
   content if we believe such content might not be well received by our
   Members or could be damaging to our brand and business.

   To the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks,
   including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on
   or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we
   produce, license or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to
   defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages
   arising from any liability could harm our results of operations. We may
   not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may
   not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.

   Some of our products and services contain open source software, which
   may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, technologies,
   products, and services in a manner that could harm our business.

   We use open source software in our products and services and anticipate
   using open source software in the future. Some open source software
   licenses require those who distribute open source software as part of
   their own software product to publicly disclose all or part of the
   source code to such software product or to make available any
   derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no
   cost. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject


                                     29
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   have not been interpreted by U.S or foreign courts, and there is a risk
   that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that
   imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to
   provide or distribute our products or services. Additionally, we could
   face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding
   release of, the open source software or derivative works that we
   developed using such software, which could include our proprietary
   source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the
   applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation
   and could require us to make our software source code freely available,
   purchase a costly license, or cease offering the implicated products or
   services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid
   infringement. This re-engineering process could require us to expend
   significant additional research and development resources, and we
   cannot guarantee that we will be successful.

   Additionally, the use of certain open source software can lead to
   greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open
   source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the
   origin of software. There is typically no support available for open
   source software, and we cannot ensure that the authors of such open
   source software will implement or push updates to address security
   risks or will not abandon further development and maintenance. Many of
   the risks associated with the use of open source software, such as the
   lack of warranties or assurances of title or performance, cannot be
   eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our
   business. We have processes to help alleviate these risks, including a
   review process for screening requests from our developers for the use
   of open source software, but we cannot be sure that all open source
   software is identified or submitted for approval prior to use in our
   products and services. Any of these risks could be difficult to
   eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have an adverse
   effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   Our Member engagement on mobile devices depends upon effective
   operation with mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that
   we do not control.

   A significant and growing portion of our Members access our platform
   through Peloton Digital and there is no guarantee that popular mobile
   devices will continue to support Peloton Digital or that mobile device
   users will use Peloton Digital rather than competing products. We are
   dependent on the interoperability of Peloton Digital with popular
   mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Android and
   iOS, and any changes in such systems that degrade the functionality of
   our digital offering or give preferential treatment to competitors
   could adversely affect our platforms usage on mobile devices.
   Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality mobile content, it is
   important that our digital offering is designed effectively and works
   well with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and
   standards that we do not control. We may not be successful in
   developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry
   or in developing products that operate effectively with these
   technologies, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is
   more difficult for our Members to access and use our platform on their
   mobile devices or Members find our mobile offerings do not effectively
   meet their needs, our competitors develop products and services that
   are perceived to operate more effectively on mobile devices, or if our
   Members choose not to access or use our platform on their mobile
   devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our
   platform, our Member growth and Member engagement could be adversely
   impacted.

   We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other
   Member data, which subjects us to legal obligations and laws and
   regulations related to security and privacy, and any actual or
   perceived failure to meet those obligations could harm our business.

   We collect, process, store, and use a wide variety of data from current
   and prospective Members, including personal information, such as home
   addresses and geolocation. Federal, state, and international laws and
   regulations governing privacy, data protection, and e-commerce
   transactions require us to safeguard our Members personal information.
   Although we have established security procedures to protect Member
   information, our or our third-party service providers security and
   testing measures may not prevent security breaches. Further, advances
   in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography,
   inadequate facility security, or other developments may result in a
   compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect Member data.
   Any compromise of our security or breach of our Members privacy could
   harm our reputation or financial condition and, therefore, our
   business.

   In addition, a party who circumvents our security measures or exploits
   inadequacies in our security measures, could, among other effects,
   misappropriate Member data or other proprietary information, cause
   interruptions in our operations, or expose Members to computer viruses
   or other disruptions. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to
   claims against


                                     30

   us. To the extent that the measures we or our third-party business
   partners have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may
   become subject to litigation, breach notification obligations, or
   regulatory or administrative sanctions, which could result in
   significant fines, penalties, or damages and harm to our reputation.
   Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of
   a data breach or other unauthorized access to our Member data, we may
   also have obligations to notify Members about the incident and we may
   need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit
   monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident.
   A growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted
   consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access
   to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. Such breach
   notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one
   jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause
   us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity
   surrounding any incident that compromises Member data.

   Furthermore, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to
   demands from individuals, privacy advocates, regulators, government
   agencies, and law enforcement agencies in various jurisdictions with
   conflicting privacy and security laws. This disclosure or refusal to
   disclose personal data may result in a breach of privacy and data
   protection policies, notices, laws, rules, court orders, and
   regulations and could result in proceedings or actions against us in
   the same or other jurisdictions, damage to our reputation and brand,
   and inability to provide our products and services to consumers in
   certain jurisdictions. Additionally, changes in the laws and
   regulations that govern our collection, use, and disclosure of Member
   data could impose additional requirements with respect to the retention
   and security of Member data, could limit our marketing activities, and
   have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
   operating results.

   Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our
   operations.

   Threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and
   sophisticated. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches,
   our products and services, as well as our servers, computer systems,
   and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable
   to cybersecurity risks, including cyber-attacks such as viruses and
   worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or
   electronic break-ins, third-party or employee theft or misuse, and
   similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our servers and
   computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our
   operations, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical
   data, unauthorized access to Member data, and loss of consumer
   confidence. In addition, we may be the target of email scams that
   attempt to acquire personal information or company assets. Despite our
   efforts to create security barriers to such threats, we may not be able
   to entirely mitigate these risks. Any cyber-attack that attempts to
   obtain our or our Members data and assets, disrupt our service, or
   otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if
   successful, could adversely affect our business, and financial
   condition and operating results, be expensive to remedy, and damage our
   reputation. In addition, any such breaches may result in negative
   publicity, and adversely affect our brand, impacting demand for our
   products and services, and could have an adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition, and operating results.

   We may be subject to warranty claims that could result in significant
   direct or indirect costs, or we could experience greater returns than
   expected, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business,
   financial condition, and operating results.

   We generally provide a minimum 12-month limited warranty on all of our
   Connected Fitness Products. The occurrence of any material defects in
   our Connected Fitness Products could make us liable for damages and
   warranty claims in excess of our current reserves, which could result
   in an adverse effect on our business prospects, liquidity, financial
   condition, and cash flows if warranty claims were to materially exceed
   anticipated levels. In addition, we could incur significant costs to
   correct any defects, warranty claims, or other problems, including
   costs related to product recalls. Any negative publicity related to the
   perceived quality and safety of our products could affect our brand
   image, decrease consumer and Member confidence and demand, and
   adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Also,
   while our warranty is limited to repairs and returns, warranty claims
   may result in litigation, the occurrence of which could have an adverse
   effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   In addition to warranties supplied by us, we also offer the option for
   customers to purchase third-party extended warranty and services
   contracts in some markets, which creates an ongoing performance
   obligation over the warranty period. Extended warranties are regulated
   in the United States on a state level and are treated differently by
   state. Outside the United States, regulations for extended warranties
   vary from country to country. Changes in interpretation of the

   regulations or other laws and regulations concerning extended
   warranties on a federal, state, local, or international level may cause
   us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in
   the future. Our failure to comply with past, present, and future
   similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products,
   reputational damage, penalties, and other sanctions, which could have
   an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating
   results.

   We or our Subscribers may be subject to sales and other taxes, and we
   may be subject to liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and
   fees.

   The application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax,
   subscription sales tax, value-added tax, provincial taxes, goods and
   services tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like
   ours and to our Subscribers is a complex and evolving issue.
   Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax
   obligations. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain
   because it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our business.
   One or more states, the federal government, or other countries may seek
   to impose additional reporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax
   collection obligations on businesses like ours that offer subscription
   services and other fitness offerings. New taxes could also require us
   to incur substantial costs to capture data and collect and remit taxes.
   If such obligations were imposed, the additional costs associated with
   tax collection, remittance, and audit requirements could have an
   adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating
   results.

   We continue to analyze our exposure for taxes and liabilities and have
   accrued $5.7 million and $4.1 million for fiscal 2018 and 2019,
   respectively, for loss contingencies resulting from potential taxes and
   liabilities.

   From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, regulatory
   disputes, and governmental inquiries that could cause us to incur
   significant expenses, divert our managements attention, and materially
   harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   From time to time, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, government
   investigations, and other proceedings involving products liability,
   competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer
   protection, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes,
   and other matters that could adversely affect our business operations
   and financial condition. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the
   number and significance of these disputes and inquiries. Litigation and
   regulatory proceedings, and particularly the intellectual property
   infringement matters that we are currently facing or could face, may be
   protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict.
   Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or
   indeterminate amounts of damages and include claims for injunctive
   relief. Additionally, our litigation costs could be significant.
   Adverse outcomes with respect to litigation or any of these legal
   proceedings may result in significant settlement costs or judgments,
   penalties and fines, or require us to modify our products or services,
   make content unavailable, or require us to stop offering certain
   features, all of which could negatively affect our membership and
   revenue growth. See the section titled BusinessLegal Proceedings

   The results of litigation, investigations, claims, and regulatory
   proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and determining
   reserves for pending litigation and other legal and regulatory matters
   requires significant judgment. There can be no assurance that our
   expectations will prove correct, and even if these matters are resolved
   in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters,
   and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could
   harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   Changes in how we market our products and services could adversely
   affect our marketing expenses and subscription levels.

   We use a broad mix of marketing and other brand-building measures to
   attract Members. We use traditional television and online advertising,
   as well as third-party social media platforms such as Facebook,
   Twitter, and Instagram, as marketing tools. As television advertising,
   online, and social media platforms continue to rapidly evolve or grow
   more competitive, we must continue to maintain a presence on these
   platforms and establish a presence on new or emerging popular social
   media and advertising and marketing platforms. If we cannot cost
   effectively use these marketing tools or if we fail to promote our
   products and services efficiently and effectively, our ability to
   acquire new Members and our financial condition may suffer. In
   addition, an increase in the use of television, online, and social
   media for product promotion and marketing may increase the burden on us
   to monitor compliance of such materials and increase the risk that such
   materials could contain problematic product or marketing claims in
   violation of applicable regulations.

   An economic downturn or economic uncertainty may adversely affect
   consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products and
   services.

   Our products and services may be considered discretionary items for
   consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such
   discretionary items include general economic conditions, and other
   factors, such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions,
   fears of recession, the availability and cost of consumer credit,
   levels of unemployment, and tax rates. In recent years, the United
   States and other significant economic markets have experienced cyclical
   downturns and worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain. As global
   economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty
   remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain
   unpredictable and subject to reductions. To date, our business has
   operated almost exclusively in a relatively strong economic environment
   and, therefore, we cannot be sure the extent to which we may be
   affected by recessionary conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions
   may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and
   services and consumer demand for our products and services may not grow
   as we expect. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related
   fluctuation in consumer demand for our products and services could have
   an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating
   results.

   Covenants in the loan and security agreement governing our revolving
   credit facility may restrict our operations, and if we do not
   effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our
   financial condition could be adversely impacted.

   We entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement,
   the Credit Agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America,
   N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, and
   Silicon Valley Bank in June 2019, which amended and restated the loan
   and security agreement that we previously entered into in November
   2017, providing for a $250 million secured revolving line of credit.
   The term loan and revolving credit facility contains various
   restrictive covenants, including, among other things, minimum liquidity
   and revenue requirements, restrictions on our ability to dispose of
   assets, make acquisitions or investments, incur debt or liens, make
   distributions to our stockholders, or enter into certain types of
   related party transactions. These restrictions may restrict our current
   and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain
   changes in our business or industry, or take future actions. Pursuant
   to the agreement, we granted the parties thereto a security interest in
   substantially all of our assets. See the section titled Managements
   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
   OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCredit Agreement for
   additional information.

   Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants can be impacted by
   events beyond our control and we may be unable to do so. Our loan and
   security agreement provide that our breach or failure to satisfy
   certain covenants constitutes an event of default. Upon the occurrence
   of an event of default, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts
   outstanding under its debt agreements to be immediately due and
   payable. In addition, our lenders would have the right to proceed
   against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the loan and
   security agreement. If the debt under our loan and security agreement
   was to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be
   able to sell sufficient collateral to repay it, which would have an
   immediate adverse effect on our business and operating results. This
   could potentially cause us to cease operations and result in a complete
   loss of your investment in our Class A common stock.

   We may engage in merger and acquisition activities, which could require
   significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute
   stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results.

   As part of our business strategy, we acquired our first company in 2018
   and have made or may make investments in other companies, products, or
   technologies in the future. We may not be able to find suitable
   acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions
   on favorable terms, if at all, in the future. If we do complete
   acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position
   or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed
   negatively by Members or investors. Moreover, an acquisition,
   investment, or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating
   difficulties and expenditures, including disrupting our ongoing
   operations, diverting management from their primary responsibilities,
   subjecting us to additional liabilities, increasing our expenses, and
   adversely impacting our business, financial condition, and operating
   results. Moreover, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities and the
   anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business
   relationship may not be realized, if, for example, we fail to
   successfully integrate such acquisitions, or the technologies
   associated with such acquisitions, into our company.

   To pay for any such acquisitions, we would have to use cash, incur
   debt, or issue equity securities, each of which may affect our
   financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result
   in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt


                                     33
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject
   us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to
   manage our operations. Additionally, we may receive indications of
   interest from other parties interested in acquiring some or all of our
   business. The time required to evaluate such indications of interest
   could require significant attention from management, disrupt the
   ordinary functioning of our business, and could have an adverse effect
   on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

   We may require additional capital to support business growth and
   objectives, and this capital might not be available to us on reasonable
   terms, if at all, and may result in stockholder dilution.

   We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with
   our net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to meet our
   anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. However, we intend
   to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may
   require additional capital to fund our business and to respond to
   competitive challenges, including the need to promote our products and
   services, develop new products and services, enhance our existing
   products, services, and operating infrastructure, and potentially to
   acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may
   need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds.
   There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be
   available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Our inability to obtain
   additional funding when needed could have an adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition, and operating results. If additional
   funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt
   securities, holders of our Class A common stock could suffer
   significant dilution, and any new shares we issue could have rights,
   preferences, and privileges superior to those of our Class A common
   stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve
   restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and
   other financial and operational matters, which may make it more
   difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business
   opportunities, including potential acquisitions.

   We are subject to payment processing risk.

   Our customers pay for our products and services using a variety of
   different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift
   cards, and online wallets. We rely on internal systems as well as those
   of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these
   payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and
   require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are
   disruptions in our payment processing systems, increases in payment
   processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as
   large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from
   payment processors, or changes to rules or regulations concerning
   payment processing, our revenue, operating expenses and results of
   operation could be adversely impacted. We leverage our third-party
   payment processors to bill Subscribers on our behalf. If these third
   parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on
   our behalf, we would have to find alternative methods of collecting
   payments, which could adversely impact Subscriber acquisition and
   retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use
   of payment methods, which could impact our results of operation and if
   not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer
   perceptions of our service.

   Our ability to use our net operating loss to offset future taxable
   income may be subject to certain limitations.

   As of June 30, 2019, we had U.S. federal net operating loss
   carryforwards, or NOLs, and state NOLs of approximately $112.6 million
   and $95.8 million, respectively, due to prior period losses which if
   not utilized will begin to expire for federal and state tax purposes
   beginning in 2036 and 2021, respectively. Realization of these NOLs
   depends on future income, and there is a risk that our existing NOLs
   could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax
   liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating results.

   In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
   amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an ownership
   change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to
   offset future taxable income. We have undergone two ownership changes
   on November 30, 2015 and April 18, 2017 and our NOLs arising before
   those dates are subject to one or more Section 382 limitations which
   may materially limit the use of such NOLs to offset our future taxable
   income. In addition, this offering, as well as future changes in our
   stock ownership, the causes of which may be outside of our control,
   could result in an additional ownership change under Section 382 of the
   Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under state laws. In addition,
   under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, tax losses
   generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be
   utilized to offset no more than 80% of taxable income annually. This
   change


                                     34
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   may require us to pay federal income taxes in future years despite
   generating a loss for federal income tax purposes. There is also a risk
   that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs,
   or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or
   otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For
   these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use
   of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability.

   We may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

   While we have historically transacted in U.S. dollars with the majority
   of our Subscribers and suppliers, we have transacted in some foreign
   currencies, such as the Canadian Dollar and U.K Pound Sterling, and may
   transact in more foreign currencies in the future. Further, certain of
   our manufacturing agreements provide for fixed costs of our Connected
   Fitness Products and hardware in Taiwanese dollars but provide for
   payment in U.S. dollars based on the then-current Taiwanese dollar to
   U.S. dollar spot rate. Accordingly, changes in the value of foreign
   currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can affect our revenue and
   operating results. As a result of such foreign currency exchange rate
   fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in
   our business and operating results. In addition, to the extent that
   fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our operating results to
   differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the
   trading price of our Class A common stock could be lowered. We do not
   currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in
   foreign currencies. However, in the future, we may use derivative
   instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to
   hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
   rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more
   than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable
   movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges
   are in place and may introduce additional risks if we are unable to
   structure effective hedges with such instruments.

   We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic
   sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our
   ability to compete in international markets.

   The United States and various foreign governments have imposed
   controls, export license requirements, and restrictions on the import
   or export of certain technologies. Our products may be subject to U.S.
   export controls, which may require submission of a product
   classification and annual or semi-annual reports. Compliance with
   applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products
   and services may create delays in the introduction of our products and
   services in international markets, prevent our international Members
   from accessing our products and services, and, in some cases, prevent
   the export of our products and services to some countries altogether.

   Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit
   the provision of products and services to countries, governments, and
   persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Even though we take precautions to
   prevent our products from being provided to targets of U.S. sanctions,
   our products and services, including our firmware updates, could be
   provided to those targets or provided by our Members. Any such
   provision could have negative consequences, including government
   investigations, penalties, reputational harm. Our failure to obtain
   required import or export approval for our products could harm our
   international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue.

   We could be subject to future enforcement action with respect to
   compliance with governmental export and import controls and economic
   sanctions laws that result in penalties, costs, and restrictions on
   export privileges that could have an adverse effect on our business,
   financial condition, and operating results.

   Failure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws,
   including the FCPA and similar laws associated with our activities
   outside of the United States, could subject us to penalties and other
   adverse consequences.

   We operate a global business and may have direct or indirect
   interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or
   state-owned or affiliated entities. We are subject to the FCPA, the
   U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S.
   Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and possibly
   other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which
   we conduct activities. These laws that prohibit companies and their
   employees and third-party intermediaries from corruptly promising,
   authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper
   payments or anything of value to foreign government officials,
   political parties, and private-sector recipients for the purpose of
   obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or
   securing any advantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required
   to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their
   transactions and have an adequate


                                     35
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   system of internal accounting controls. In many foreign countries,
   including countries in which we may conduct business, it may be a local
   custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the
   FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. We face significant
   risks if we or any of our directors, officers, employees, agents or
   other partners or representatives fail to comply with these laws and
   governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek
   to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which
   could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation,
   operating results and financial condition.

   We have begun to implement an anti-corruption compliance program and
   policies, procedures and training designed to foster compliance with
   these laws, however, our employees, contractors, and agents, and
   companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may
   take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law. Any such
   violation could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business,
   operating results and prospects.

   Any violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws, or
   anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints,
   adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges,
   severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA,
   suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, any of which
   could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, business,
   operating results, and prospects. In addition, responding to any
   enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of
   managements attention and resources and significant defense costs and
   other professional fees.

   Changes in legislation in U.S. and foreign taxation of international
   business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies, as
   well as the application of such laws, could adversely impact our
   financial position and operating results.

   Recent or future changes to U.S., U.K. and other foreign tax laws could
   impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. We generally conduct
   our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries,
   branches, or representative offices and report our taxable income in
   various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in
   those jurisdictions. Further, we are in the process of implementing an
   international structure that aligns with our financial and operational
   objectives as evaluated based on our international markets, expansion
   plans, and operational needs for headcount and physical infrastructure
   outside the United States. The intercompany relationships between our
   legal entities are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations
   administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Although
   we believe we are compliant with applicable transfer pricing and other
   tax laws in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other relevant
   countries, due to changes in such laws and rules, we may have to modify
   our international structure in the future, which will incur costs, may
   increase our worldwide effective tax rate, and may adversely affect our
   financial position and operating results. In addition, significant
   judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining
   our provision for income taxes.

   During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and
   calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For
   example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
   earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower
   statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have
   higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
   or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws,
   regulations, principles, and interpretations. As we operate in numerous
   taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to
   diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities
   of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in
   different countries to have conflicting views with respect to, among
   other things, the manner in which the arms-length standard is applied
   for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of
   intellectual property.

   If U.S., U.K., or other foreign tax laws further change, if our current
   or future structures and arrangements are challenged by a taxing
   authority, or if we are unable to appropriately adapt the manner in
   which we operate our business, we may have to undertake further costly
   modifications to our international structure and our tax liabilities
   and operating results may be adversely affected.

   The requirements of being a public company, including maintaining
   adequate internal control over our financial and management systems,
   may strain our resources, divert managements attention, and affect our
   ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board
   members.

   As a public company we will incur significant legal, accounting, and
   other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We will be
   subject to reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
   1934, as amended, or the


                                     36

   Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley
   Act, the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, the rules and
   regulations of the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or
   Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations.
   Compliance with these rules and regulations will likely strain our
   financial and management systems, internal controls, and employees.

   The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual,
   quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and
   operating results. Moreover, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among
   other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and
   procedures, and internal control, over financial reporting. In order to
   maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and
   procedures, and internal control over, financial reporting to meet this
   standard, significant resources and management oversight may be
   required. In the course of preparing our financial statements for
   fiscal 2018, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control
   over financial reporting. If, in the future, we have material
   weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial
   reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our
   consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated.
   Effective internal control is necessary for us to produce reliable
   financial reports and is important to prevent fraud.

   In addition, we will be required to comply with the auditor attestation
   requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when we cease to
   be an emerging growth company. We expect to incur significant expenses
   and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance
   with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the
   Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result of the complexity involved in complying
   with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our
   managements attention may be diverted from other business concerns,
   which could harm our business, operating results, and financial
   condition. Although we have already hired additional employees to
   assist us in complying with these requirements, our finance team is
   small and we may need to hire more employees in the future, or engage
   outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses.

   We also expect that being a public company and complying with
   applicable rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to
   obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required
   to incur substantially higher costs to obtain and maintain the same or
   similar coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for
   us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors
   and qualified executive officers.

   We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over
   financial reporting and if our remediation of such material weaknesses
   is not effective, or if we fail to develop and maintain an effective
   system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial
   reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial
   statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be
   impaired.

   In the course of preparing our financial statements for fiscal 2018, we
   identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
   reporting. The material weakness had not been remediated as of June 30,
   2019. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of
   deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that
   there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
   annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
   detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified relate
   to information technology general controls, controls to address
   segregation of certain accounting duties, timely reconciliation and
   analysis of certain key accounts and the review of journal entries. We
   have concluded that these material weaknesses arose because, as a
   private company, we did not have the necessary business processes,
   systems, personnel and related internal controls necessary to satisfy
   the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public
   company.

   To address our material weaknesses, we have added personnel as well as
   implemented new financial systems and processes. We intend to continue
   to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses described above
   through hiring additional qualified accounting and financial reporting
   personnel, and further evolving our accounting processes. We will not
   be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps
   have been completed and have been operating effectively for a
   sufficient period of time.

   Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to
   date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to
   remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses
   in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will
   prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. Our current
   controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate
   because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses
   in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial
   reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or


                                     37

   maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their
   implementation or improvement could harm our operating results or cause
   us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a
   restatement of our financial statements for prior periods.

   Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to
   formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over
   financial reporting until after we are no longer an emerging growth
   company as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent
   registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in
   the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal
   control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating.
   Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over
   financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic
   management evaluations and annual independent registered public
   accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our
   internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be
   required to include in our periodic reports that are filed with the
   SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal
   control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose
   confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would
   likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A
   common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these
   requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global
   Select Market.

   If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting
   policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be
   adversely affected.

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
   accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and
   on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
   circumstances, as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of
   Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting
   Policies and Estimates. The results of these estimates form the basis
   for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities,
   and stockholders equity/deficit, and the amount of revenue and
   expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant
   assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial
   statements include those related to revenue related reserves, content
   costs for past use reserve, fair value measurements including common
   stock valuations, useful lives of property plant and equipment, product
   warranty, goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets, accounting for
   income taxes, stock-based compensation expense and commitments and
   contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our
   assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our
   assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the
   expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a
   decline in the price of our Class A common stock.

   Our reported financial results may be negatively impacted by the
   changes in GAAP.

   GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards
   Board, or FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and
   interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these
   principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our
   reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of
   transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a
   change. For example, in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
   or Topic 842, Leases, which requires recognition of lease assets and
   lease liabilities on the balance sheet by lessees for leases classified
   as operating leases with a term of more than 12 months. Topic 842 is
   effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
   after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
   We early adopted this standard as of July 1, 2019. The most significant
   change related to the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease
   liabilities on our balance sheet for real estate operating leases, as
   well as the de-recognition of the build-to-suit asset and liability.
   See Note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial
   statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for additional
   information.

   The forecasts of market growth included in this prospectus may prove to
   be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the
   forecasted growth, we cannot assure you that our business will grow at
   a similar rate, if at all.

   Growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based
   on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The
   forecasts in this prospectus relating to the expected growth in the
   connected fitness and wellness market, including estimates based on our
   own internal survey data, may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the
   market experiences the forecasted growth described in this prospectus,
   we may not grow our business at a similar rate, or at all. Our growth
   is

   subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our
   business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties.
   Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth included in this prospectus
   should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.

   Our management team has limited experience managing a public company.

   Most members of our management team have limited experience managing a
   publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and
   complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public
   companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently
   manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant
   regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal
   securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and
   investors. These new obligations and constituents will require
   significant attention from our senior management and could divert their
   attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which
   could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating
   results.

   Our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, fire, power
   outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by
   manmade problems such as terrorism.

   Our business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes,
   fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist
   attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins, and similar events. The
   third-party systems and operations and manufacturers we rely on are
   subject to similar risks. For example, a significant natural disaster,
   such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, could have an adverse effect on
   our business, financial condition and operating results, and our
   insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that
   may occur. Acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan
   areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could also
   cause disruptions in our or our suppliers and manufacturers
   businesses or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient
   protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as natural
   disasters affecting locations that store significant inventory of our
   products, that house our servers, or from which we generate content. As
   we rely heavily on our computer and communications systems, and the
   internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer
   service, these disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run
   our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt suppliers and
   manufacturers businesses, which could have an adverse effect on our
   business, financial condition, and operating results.

   Regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur
   additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs
   of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products.

   We are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
   and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which will require us to conduct
   due diligence on and disclose whether or not our products contain
   conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could
   adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of the
   materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products.
   In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the
   disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting
   diligence procedures to determine the sources of minerals that may be
   used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable,
   potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a
   consequence of such due diligence activities. It is also possible that
   we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our
   products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we
   are unable to alter our products, processes, or sources of supply to
   avoid such materials.

   Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock

   There has been no prior public market for our Class A common stock, the
   stock price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline
   regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to
   resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price.

   There has been no public market for our Class A common stock prior to
   this offering. The initial public offering price for our Class A common
   stock was determined through negotiations between us and the
   underwriters and may vary from the market price of our Class A common
   stock following this offering. The market prices of the securities of
   newly public companies such as us have historically been highly
   volatile. The market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate
   significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond
   our control, including:


     

   overall performance of the equity markets and the performance of
   technology companies in particular;


                                     39
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

     

   variations in our operating results, cash flows, and other financial
   metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to
   analyst expectations;


     

   changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public or
   our failure to meet these projections;


     

   failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us,
   changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow
   our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations
   of investors;


     

   recruitment or departure of key personnel;


     

   the economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;


     

   negative publicity related to problems in our manufacturing or the real
   or perceived quality of our products, as well as the failure to timely
   launch new products or services that gain market acceptance;


     

   rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our
   industry;


     

   announcements by us or our competitors of new products, services,
   features and content, significant technical innovations, acquisitions,
   strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;


     

   new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or
   regulations applicable to our business;


     

   lawsuits threatened or filed against us, litigation involving our
   industry, or both;


     

   developments or disputes concerning our or other parties products,
   services, or intellectual property rights;


     

   other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents
   of terrorism, or responses to these events;


     

   the expiration of contractual lock-up or market standoff agreements;
   and


     

   sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders.

   In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and
   volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the
   market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of
   many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or
   disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In
   the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action
   litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become
   involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial
   costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our
   business, and adversely affect our business.

   Sales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial amount of our Class A
   common stock in the public markets by our existing security holders may
   cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.

   Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock
   into the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive
   officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these
   sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common
   stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through
   the sale of additional equity securities. Many of our existing security
   holders have substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the equity
   they hold, and may take, or attempt to take, steps to sell, directly or
   indirectly, their shares or otherwise secure, or limit the risk to, the
   value of their unrecognized gains on those shares. Based on zero shares
   of our Class A common stock and 235,942,233 shares of our Class B
   common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019, we will
   have                (                shares if the option to purchase
   additional shares is exercised in full) of our Class A common stock
   and                shares of our Class B common stock outstanding after
   this offering.

   All of the shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering will be
   freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the
   Securities Act except that any shares held by our affiliates, as
   defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, would only be able to be
   sold in compliance with Rule 144 and any applicable lock-up agreements
   described below. Approximately                  shares of Class A
   common stock, assuming no exercise of outstanding options, will be
   immediately available for sale in the public market. Approximately
                shares of our common stock are also subject to the lock-up
   agreement or market standoff agreements described below.

   In connection with this offering, subject to certain customary
   exceptions, we, all of our directors and executive officers, and
   substantially all of the holders of our common stock, or securities
   exercisable for or convertible into our common stock outstanding
   immediately prior to this offering, have entered into market standoff
   agreements with us or lock-up agreements with the underwriters that
   prohibit from selling, contracting to sell, granting any option for the
   sale of, transferring, or otherwise disposing of any shares of common
   stock, stock options, or any security or instrument related to common
   stock


                                     40

   or stock options without the permission of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and
   J.P. Morgan Securities LLC on behalf of the underwriters for a period
   of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, subject to early
   termination as described below.

   We have a large number of security holders and such security holders
   have acquired their interests over an extended period of time and
   pursuant to a number of different agreements containing a variety of
   terms governing restrictions on the sale, short sale, transfer,
   hedging, pledging, or other disposition of their interests in our
   equity. Holders of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock and
   securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares
   of our Class A common stock are subject to restrictions on their
   ability to sell or transfer their equity either prior to the pricing of
   this offering or from the pricing of this offering through the date
   that is 180 days after the date of this prospectus. We refer to such
   period as the lock-up period. Pursuant to the lock-up agreements with
   the underwriters, if (1) at least 120 days have elapsed since the date
   of this prospectus, (2) we have publicly released our earnings results
   for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred, and
   (3) such lock-up period is scheduled to end during or within five
   trading days prior to a broadly applicable period during which trading
   in our securities would not be permitted under our insider trading
   policy, or a blackout period, such lock-up period will end ten trading
   days prior to the commencement of such blackout period. We and the
   underwriters may release certain stockholders from the market standoff
   agreements or lock-up agreements prior to the end of the lock-up
   period. Record holders of our securities are typically the parties to
   the lock-up agreements with the underwriters and to the market standoff
   agreements with us referred to above, while holders of beneficial
   interests in our shares who are not also holders in respect of such
   shares are not typically subject to any such agreements or other
   similar restrictions. Accordingly, we believe that holders of
   beneficial interests who are not holders and are not bound by market
   standoff or lock-up agreements could enter into transactions with
   respect to those beneficial interests that negatively impact our stock
   price. In addition, an equity holder who is neither subject to a market
   standoff agreement with us nor a lock-up agreement with the
   underwriters may be able to sell, short sell, transfer, hedge, pledge,
   or otherwise dispose of or attempt to sell, short sell, transfer,
   hedge, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, their equity interests at any
   time after the closing of this offering. Any such transaction described
   above involving shares of our Class A common stock, or any perception
   by the market that such transaction may occur, could cause our stock
   price to decline.

   When the applicable lock-up and market standoff periods described above
   expire, we and our security holders subject to a lock-up agreement or
   market standoff agreement will be able to sell our shares in the public
   market. In addition, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities
   LLC, on behalf of the underwriters, may, in their sole discretion,
   release all or some portion of the shares subject to lock-up agreements
   prior to the expiration of the lock-up period. Sales of a substantial
   number of such shares upon expiration of the lock-up and market
   standoff agreements, or the perception that such sales may occur, or
   early release of these agreements, could cause our market price to fall
   or make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock at
   a time and price that you deem appropriate.

   In addition, as of June 30, 2019, we had stock options outstanding
   that, if fully exercised, would result in the issuance of 64,602,124
   shares of Class B common stock. All of the shares of Class B common
   stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, and the shares
   reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, will be
   registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly,
   these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon
   issuance subject to existing lock-up or market standoff agreements and
   applicable vesting requirements.

   Immediately following this offering, the holders
   of                shares of our Class B common stock will have rights,
   subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration
   statements for the public resale of the Class A common stock issuable
   upon conversion of such shares or to include such shares in
   registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders.

   We may also issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible
   into shares of our common stock from time to time in connection with a
   financing, acquisition, investment, or otherwise. Any further issuance
   could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and
   cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

   The dual class structure of our common stock will have the effect of
   concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our
   capital stock prior to the completion of this offering, including our
   directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders who will hold in the
   aggregate     % of the voting power of our capital stock following the
   completion of this offering, which will limit or preclude your ability
   to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and
   the approval of any change of control transaction.

   Our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common
   stock, which is the stock we are offering in this offering, has one
   vote per share. Following this offering, the holders of our outstanding
   Class B common stock will hold         % of the voting power of our
   outstanding capital stock, with our directors, executive officers, and
   holders of more than 5% of our common stock, and their respective
   affiliates, holding in the aggregate     % of the voting power of our
   capital stock. Because of the twenty-to-one voting ratio between our
   Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common
   stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined
   voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all
   matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until the earlier of
   (i) the date specified by a vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the then
   outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii) ten years from the
   closing of this offering, and (iii) the date the shares of Class B
   common stock cease to represent at least 1% of all outstanding shares
   of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude
   your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future,
   including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational
   documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially
   all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring
   stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage
   unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that
   you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.

   Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally
   result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to
   limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate
   planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A
   common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the
   relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who
   retain their shares in the long term. See the section titled
   Description of Capital StockAnti-Takeover Provisions for additional
   information.

   The dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the
   trading market for our Class A common stock.

   Certain stock index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones, exclude companies
   with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to
   certain stock indices, including the S&P 500. In addition, several
   stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors oppose the
   use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure
   of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common
   stock in such indices, may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish
   negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or
   otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure, and may
   result in large institutional investors not purchasing shares of our
   Class A common stock. Any exclusion from stock indices could result in
   a less active trading market for our Class A common stock. Any actions
   or publications by stockholder advisory firms or institutional
   investors critical of our corporate governance practices or capital
   structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common
   stock.

   We are an emerging growth company and intend to take advantage of the
   reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies
   which may make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.

   We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. We will
   remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last
   day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of
   $1.07 billion or more; (2) the last day of the fiscal year following
   the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of this offering;
   (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in
   nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; and (4) the date
   on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the
   rules of the SEC. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company,
   we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain
   disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies
   that are not emerging growth companies, including:


     

   not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
   of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;


     

   reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and


     

   exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote
   on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden
   parachute payments not previously approved.

   We currently intend to take advantage of the available exemptions
   described above. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens
   in this prospectus. In particular, we have not included all of the
   executive compensation information that


                                     42
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot
   predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive
   if we rely on these exemptions. Furthermore, under the JOBS Act,
   emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised
   accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to
   private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves
   of this accommodation allowing for delayed adoption of new or revised
   accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new
   or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not
   emerging growth companies. If some investors find our Class A common
   stock less attractive as a result of these decisions, there may be a
   less active trading market for our Class A common stock and the price
   of our Class A common stock may be more volatile.

   If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish
   inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of
   our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.

   The trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on
   the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish
   about us or our business, our market, and our competitors. We do not
   have any control over these analysts. If few securities analysts
   commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us,
   the trading price for our Class A common stock would be negatively
   affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our
   Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research
   about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely
   decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail
   to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock
   could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock price and
   trading volume to decline.

   An active public trading market may not develop or be sustained
   following this offering.

   Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A
   common stock. We have applied to list our Class A common stock on the
   Nasdaq Global Select Market, however, an active trading market may not
   develop following the completion of this offering or, if developed, may
   not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability
   to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price
   that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also
   reduce the market price of your shares of Class A common stock. An
   inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling
   shares or to acquire other companies or technologies by using our
   shares as consideration. We cannot predict the prices at which our
   Class A common stock will trade. The initial public offering price of
   our Class A common stock will be determined by negotiations between us
   and the underwriters and may not bear any relationship to the market
   price at which our Class A common stock will trade after this offering
   or to any other established criteria of the value of our business and
   prospects.

   Because the initial public offering price of our Class A common stock
   is substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per
   share of our outstanding common stock following this offering, new
   investors will experience immediate and substantial dilution.

   The initial public offering price is substantially higher than the pro
   forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately
   following this offering based on the total value of our tangible assets
   less our total liabilities. Therefore, if you purchase shares of our
   Class A common stock in this offering, based on the midpoint of the
   price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and the
   issuance by us of                shares of Class A common stock in this
   offering, you will experience immediate dilution of
   $                per share, the difference between the price per share
   you pay for our Class A common stock and its pro forma net tangible
   book value per share as of June 30, 2019. Furthermore, if the
   underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares, if
   outstanding stock options are exercised, if we issue awards to our
   employees under our equity incentive plans, or if we otherwise issue
   additional shares of our Class A common stock, you could experience
   further dilution. See the section titled Dilution for additional
   information.

   We will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds we receive
   in this offering and may not use them effectively.

   We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we
   receive in this offering, including for any of the purposes described
   in the section titled Use of Proceeds, and you will not have the
   opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether the
   net proceeds are being used appropriately. Because of the number and
   variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds
   from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from
   their currently intended use. If we do not use the net proceeds that we
   receive in this offering effectively, our business, financial

   condition, operating results, and prospects could be harmed, and the
   market price for our Class A common stock could decline. Pending their
   use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term,
   investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market
   accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and guaranteed
   obligations of the U.S. government that may not generate a high yield
   to our stockholders. These investments may not yield a favorable return
   to our investors.

   We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.

   We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock
   and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
   Additionally, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is
   limited by the restrictions under the terms of our loan and security
   agreement. We anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will retain
   all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business
   and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends
   in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors.
   Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock
   after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to
   realize any future gains on their investments.

   Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make
   an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more
   difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our
   current management, limit our stockholders ability to obtain a
   favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,
   officers, or employees, and limit the market price of our Class A
   common stock.

   Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated
   bylaws that will be in effect upon the completion of this offering may
   have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or
   other change of control of our company that the stockholders may
   consider favorable. In addition, because our board of directors is
   responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these
   provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to
   replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult
   for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among
   other things, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated
   bylaws include provisions that:


     

   provide that our board of directors will be classified into three
   classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;


     

   permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and
   fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;


     

   require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated
   certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;


     

   authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board
   of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;


     

   provide that only the chairman of our board of directors, our chief
   executive officer, or a majority of our board of directors will be
   authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;


     

   eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of
   stockholders;


     

   prohibit cumulative voting;


     

   provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with
   the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;


     

   provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our
   Class B common stock may have the ability to control the outcome of
   matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly
   less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock,
   including the election of directors and significant corporate
   transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its
   assets;


     

   prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all
   stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;


     

   provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make,
   alter, or repeal our bylaws; and


     

   establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to
   our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon
   by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.

   In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation will provide
   that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, to the fullest
   extent permitted by law, will be the exclusive forum for any derivative
   action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any


                                     44
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a
   claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation
   Law, or DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our
   restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is
   governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum
   provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a
   judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of
   our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage
   lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.
   This exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims that are vested
   in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court
   of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of
   Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter
   jurisdiction. For instance, the provision would not preclude the filing
   of claims brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the
   Exchange Act or Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder
   in federal court.

   Moreover, Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage, delay, or prevent a
   change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain
   restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions
   between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. See the
   section titled Description of Capital Stock for additional
   information.

   We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the
   forward-looking statements made in this prospectus.

   We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current
   expectations and projections about future events and trends that we
   believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations,
   business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and
   objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are
   subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including
   those described in the section titled Risk Factors. Moreover, we
   operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New
   risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management
   to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on
   our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
   factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
   contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of
   these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and
   trends discussed in this prospectus may not occur and actual results
   could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied
   in the forward-looking statements.

   You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of
   future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the
   forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we
   believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
   statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
   performance, or

   forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this
   prospectus or to conform these statements to actual results or revised
   expectations, except as required by law.

   You should read this prospectus and the documents that we reference in
   this prospectus and have filed with the SEC as exhibits to the
   registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with the
   understanding that our actual future results, performance, and events
   and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

                          INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA

   Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this prospectus
   concerning our industry and the markets in which we operate, including
   our general expectations, market position, market opportunity, and
   market size, is based on information from various sources, including
   our own estimates, as well as assumptions that we have made that are
   based on such data and other similar sources, and on our knowledge of
   the market for our products and services. This information involves a
   number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to
   give undue weight to such estimates. While we believe the market
   position, market opportunity, and market size information included in
   this prospectus is generally reliable, information of this sort is
   inherently imprecise. In addition, projections, assumptions, and
   estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the
   industry in which we operate is necessarily subject to a high degree of
   uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those
   described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this
   prospectus. These and other factors could cause results to differ
   materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the
   independent parties and by us.

   This prospectus contains statistical data, estimates, and forecasts
   that are based on industry publications or reports generated by
   third-party providers, or other publicly available information, as well
   as other information based on internal estimates.

   Statistics and estimates related to our TAM and SAM are based on
   internal reports conducted with the assistance of our third-party
   marketing partner, Directions Research, Inc. In order to determine our
   TAM and SAM, we conducted an online survey of consumers across the
   United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada, surveying over
   1,000 consumers in each market. Consumers who qualified for our study
   were (i) between the ages of 18 and 70 years old and (ii) had
   self-reported household annual pre-tax incomes of $50,000 or more, or
   the foreign equivalent. Consumer responses to the survey were used as
   the basis for determining our TAM and SAM by weighting such responses
   to population censuses based on age and/or income. To calculate our
   TAM, we multiplied the percentage of respondents who reported having
   broadband internet and being open to subscription fitness by total
   households represented in the survey, and then weighted the response
   based on the relevant population censuses. To calculate our SAM, we
   measured the percentage of the TAM population who expressed interest in
   purchasing products within one of our existing categories. To better
   estimate a respondents likelihood to purchase one of our Connected
   Fitness Products, we made certain downward adjustments based on
   industry probability purchase assumptions, to account for conflicting
   responses from individual respondents, and where a respondents
   response relating to how much he or she would pay for a Peloton product
   was below the mean stated price by one standard deviation or more. Once
   each respondents probability of purchasing each product was
   determined, we weighted the responses based on the relevant population.
   We calculate the expected SAM for our product portfolio by multiplying
   the average weighted purchase probability for each product by the total
   country TAM.

   Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included
   elsewhere in this prospectus have been subject to rounding adjustments.
   Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables or charts may
   not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and
   figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as
   applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of
   the percentages that precede them.

                               USE OF PROCEEDS

   We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of
   shares of our Class A common stock in this offering at an assumed
   initial public offering price of $                per share, which is
   the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
   prospectus, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and
   estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
   $                million, or $                million if the
   underwriters option to purchase additional shares is exercised in
   full.

   A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering
   price of $                per share would increase (decrease) the net
   proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately
   $                million, assuming the number of shares of our Class A
   common stock offered by us remains the same, and after deducting the
   estimated underwriting discount. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of
   1,000,000 shares in the number of shares of our Class A common stock
   offered by us would increase (decrease) the net proceeds that we
   receive from this offering by approximately $                million,
   assuming that the assumed initial public offering price of
   $                remains the same, and after deducting the estimated
   underwriting discount.

   The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our
   capitalization and financial flexibility, create a public market for
   our Class A common stock, and enable access to the public equity
   markets for us and our stockholders. We primarily intend to use the net
   proceeds that we receive from this offering for working capital and
   other general corporate purposes, which may include research and
   development and sales and marketing activities, general and
   administrative matters, and capital expenditures. We may also use a
   portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in,
   technologies, solutions, or businesses that complement our business.
   However, we do not have binding agreements or commitments for any
   acquisitions or investments outside the ordinary course of business at
   this time.

   We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds of this
   offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from
   this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing
   securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit,
   commercial paper, and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.

                               DIVIDEND POLICY

   We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We
   currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings
   for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying
   any dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. Any
   future determination to declare dividends will be made at the
   discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial
   condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business
   conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem
   relevant. In addition, our Credit Agreement contains restrictions on
   our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock. See the section
   titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
   Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources for additional
   information.

   a pro forma as adjusted basis to give effect to the adjustments

   A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering
   price of $                per share, which is the midpoint of the price
   range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase
   (decrease) our pro forma as adjusted cash and cash equivalents,
   additional paid-in capital, total stockholders (deficit) equity, and
   total capitalization by approximately $                million,
   assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the
   cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting
   the estimated underwriting discount. Similarly, each increase
   (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares in the number of shares offered by us
   would increase (decrease) our pro forma as adjusted cash and cash
   equivalents, additional paid-in capital, total stockholders (deficit)
   equity, and total capitalization by approximately
   $                million, assuming that the assumed initial public
   offering price, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on
   the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting
   the estimated underwriting discount. If the underwriters option to
   purchase additional shares is exercised in full, the pro forma as
   adjusted amount of each of cash and cash equivalents, additional
   paid-in capital, total stockholders (deficit) equity, and total
   capitalization would increase by approximately $                , after
   deducting the estimated underwriting discount and we would
   have                 shares of our Class A common stock and 235,942,233
   shares of our Class B common stock issued and outstanding, pro forma as
   adjusted.

   The number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common
   stock to be outstanding after this offering is based upon zero shares
   of our Class A common stock outstanding and 235,942,233 shares of our
   Class B common stock outstanding, in each case, as of June 30, 2019 and
   does not include:


     

   64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the
   exercise of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock
   outstanding as of June 30, 2019, with a weighted-average exercise price
   of $6.71 per share;


     

   664,050 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise
   of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted
   between June 30, 2019 and August 26, 2019 with an exercise price of
   $22.05 per share;


     

   240,000 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise
   of a warrant to purchase Class B common stock outstanding as of
   June 30, 2019, with an exercise price of $0.19 per share; and


     

                shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance
   under our equity compensation plans, consisting of (1) 9,085,593 shares
   of our Class B common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2015
   Plan as of June 30, 2019 (which reserve does not reflect the options to
   purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted after June 30,
   2019), (2)                 shares of our Class A common stock reserved
   for future issuance under our 2019 Plan, which will become effective on
   the date immediately prior to the date of this prospectus, and
   (3)                shares of our Class A common stock reserved for
   issuance under our 2019 ESPP, which will become effective on the date
   of this prospectus.

   On the date immediately prior to the date of this prospectus, any
   remaining shares available for issuance under our 2015 Plan will be
   added to the shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance
   under our 2019 Plan, and we will cease granting awards under the 2015
   Plan. Our 2019 Plan and 2019 ESPP also provide for automatic annual
   increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder. See the section

                                  DILUTION

   If you invest in our Class A common stock, your interest will be
   diluted to the extent of the difference between the amount per share
   paid by purchasers of shares of Class A common stock in this initial
   public offering and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value
   per share of Class A common stock immediately after this offering.

   As of June 30, 2019, our pro forma net tangible book value was
   approximately $378.8 million, or $1.61 per share of common stock. Our
   pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the amount of
   our total tangible assets reduced by the amount of our total
   liabilities and divided by the total number of shares of our common
   stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019 after giving effect to (1) the
   redesignation of our outstanding common stock as Class B common stock
   on                , 2019, (2) the automatic conversion of all
   outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock
   outstanding as of June 30, 2019 into 210,640,629 shares of our Class B
   common stock, and (3) the filing and effectiveness of our restated
   certificate of incorporation.

   After giving effect to our sale in this offering of            shares
   of our Class A common stock, at an assumed initial public offering
   price of $            per share, which is the midpoint of the price
   range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after
   deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering
   expenses, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of
   June 30, 2019 would have been approximately $            million, or
   $            per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro
   forma net tangible book value of $            per share to our existing
   stockholders and an immediate dilution of $            per share to
   investors purchasing Class A common stock in this offering at the
   assumed initial public offering price.

   The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis to
   new investors:


               Assumed initial public offering price per share
                                         $

   Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2019, before
                       giving effect to this offering
                                       $

   Increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share attributable to
                       new investors in this offering






           Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share






   Dilution in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share to
                       new investors in this offering
                                         $





   A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering
   price of $             per share, which is the midpoint of the price
   range reflected on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase
   (decrease) our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share
   after this offering by $            per share and would increase
   (decrease) the dilution per share to new investors in this offering by
   $            per share, assuming the number of shares of Class A common
   stock offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,
   remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting
   discount. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares in
   the number of shares of Class A common stock offered by us would
   increase (decrease) the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value
   per share after this offering by $            per share and would
   increase (decrease) the dilution to new investors by $            per
   share, assuming the assumed initial public offering price, which is the
   midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
   prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated
   underwriting discount.

   If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares
   in full, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of
   our common stock after giving effect to this offering would be
   $            per share and the dilution in pro forma net tangible book
   value per share to investors in this offering would be $            per
   share.

   The following table summarizes, on a pro forma as adjusted basis as of
   June 30, 2019, after giving effect to the pro forma adjustments
   described above, the difference between existing stockholders and new
   investors purchasing shares of Class A common stock in this offering
   with respect to the number of shares purchased from us, the total
   consideration paid to us, and the average price per share paid by our
   existing stockholders or to be paid by investors purchasing shares in
   this

   offering at an assumed offering price of $            per share, which
   is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
   prospectus, before deducting the estimated underwriting discount and

   A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering
   price of $            per share, which is the midpoint of the price
   range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase
   (decrease) total consideration paid by new investors and total
   consideration paid by all stockholders by $            million,
   assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the
   cover page of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting the
   estimated underwriting discount.

   Except as otherwise indicated, the above discussion and tables assume
   no exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares
   of our Class A common stock. If the underwriters exercise their option
   to purchase additional shares in full, our existing stockholders would
   own            % and our new investors would own                % of
   the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding after this
   offering.

   In addition, to the extent we issue any additional stock options or any
   outstanding stock options or warrant are exercised, or we issue any
   other securities or convertible debt in the future, investors will
   experience further dilution.

   The number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common
   stock to be outstanding after this offering is based upon zero shares
   of our Class A common stock outstanding and 235,942,233 shares of our
   Class B common stock outstanding, in each case, as of June 30, 2019:


     

   64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the
   exercise of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock
   outstanding as of June 30, 2019, with a weighted-average exercise price
   of $6.71 per share;


     

   664,050 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise
   of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted
   between June 30, 2019 and August 26, 2019 with an exercise price of
   $22.05 per share;


     

   240,000 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise
   of a warrant to purchase Class B common stock outstanding as of
   June 30, 2019, with an exercise price of $0.19 per share; and


     

                shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance
   under our equity compensation plans, consisting of (1) 9,085,593 shares
   of our Class B common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2015
   Plan as of June 30, 2019 (which reserve does not reflect the options to
   purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted after June 30,
   2019), (2)                 shares of our Class A common stock reserved
   for future issuance under our 2019 Plan, which will become effective on
   the date immediately prior to the date of this prospectus, and
   (3)                shares of our Class A common stock reserved for
   issuance under our 2019 ESPP, which will become effective on the date
   of this prospectus.

   On the date immediately prior to the date of this prospectus, any
   remaining shares available for issuance under our 2015 Plan will be
   added to the shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance
   under our 2019 Plan, and we will cease granting awards under the 2015
   Plan. Our 2019 Plan and 2019 ESPP also provide for automatic annual
   increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder. See the section

   Non-GAAP Financial Measures

   In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we
   believe the following non-GAAP financial measures are useful in
   evaluating our operating performance.

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin

   We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude: interest
   income, net; other income, net; provision for income taxes;
   depreciation and amortization expense; stock-based compensation
   expense; costs related to acquisitions; certain litigation expenses,
   consisting of legal settlements and related fees for specific
   proceedings that arise outside of the ordinary course of our business;
   and the ground lease expense related to build-to-suit lease
   obligations. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted
   EBITDA by total revenue.

   We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin as measures of
   operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. We
   believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors
   for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding
   and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are widely used by investors
   and securities analysts to measure a companys operating performance
   without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense,
   depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other (income)
   expense, net, and provision for income taxes that can vary
   substantially from company to company depending upon their financing,
   capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired;


     

   our management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in
   conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP
   for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual
   operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the
   effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial
   performance; and


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide consistency and
   comparability with our past financial performance, facilitate
   period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results, and also
   facilitate comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use
   similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.

   Our use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have limitations
   as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in
   isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as
   reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are, or may in the
   future be, as follows:


     

   although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges,
   the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in
   the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not
   reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or
   for new capital expenditure requirements;


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin exclude stock-based
   compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be
   for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our
   business and an important part of our compensation strategy;


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect: (1) changes
   in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) interest
   expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or
   principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or
   (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to
   us;


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect certain
   litigation expenses, consisting of legal settlements and related fees
   for specific proceedings, that arise outside of the ordinary course of
   our business;


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect the non-cash
   ground lease expense related to our new corporate headquarters lease
   whereby we are considered, for accounting purposes only, the owner of
   the construction project under current build-to-suit lease accounting;


     

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect transaction
   costs related to acquisitions; and


     

   the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of
   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may differ from the expenses
   and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from Adjusted
   EBITDA when they report their operating results and we may, in the
   future, exclude other significant, unusual or non-recurring expenses or
   other items from these financial measures.

   material in our content in exchange for a mutually-agreed payment. We
   refer to these payments as content costs for past use. Included in
   Adjusted EBITDA are content costs for past use. These costs had a
   negative basis point impact on Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 711, 333, and
   180 for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.

   Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin

   We define Subscription Contribution as subscription revenue less cost
   of subscription revenue, adjusted to exclude from cost of subscription
   revenue, depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based
   compensation expense. Subscription Contribution Margin is calculated by
   dividing Subscription Contribution by subscription revenue.

   We use Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin
   to measure our ability to scale and leverage the costs of our Connected
   Fitness Subscriptions and measure Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime
   Value. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to
   investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in
   understanding and evaluating our operating results because our
   management uses Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution
   Margin in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance
   with GAAP for planning purposes, including the preparation of our
   annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and
   the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our
   financial performance.

   Our use of Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution
   Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not
   consider these in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our
   financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are
   as follows:


     

   although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges,
   the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in
   the future, and Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution
   Margin do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such
   replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and

   Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin exclude
   stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will

   Because of these limitations, Subscription Contribution and
   Subscription Contribution Margin should be considered along with other

   Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of
   important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
   from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking
   statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Our
   fiscal year end is June 30, and our fiscal quarters end on

   Overview of Our Business and History

   Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a
   loyal community of over 1.4 million Members. We pioneered connected,
   technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive,
   instructor-led boutique classes to our Members anytime, anywhere. We
   make fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient
   while fostering social connections that encourage our Members to be the
   best versions of themselves.

   Key milestones in our growth history include:

   We define a Member as any individual who has a Peloton account. We
   define a Connected Fitness Subscriber as either a paid Connected
   Fitness Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription with a successful
   credit card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers) or
   a paused Connected Fitness Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription
   where the Subscriber has requested to Pause for up to 3 months). We
   define a Digital Subscriber as an individual or household that has a
   paid Peloton Digital subscription with a successful credit card
   billing.


   **

   Total Global Subscribers represents the aggregate number of Connected
   Fitness Subscribers and Digital Subscribers. As of June 30, 2019, we
   had approximately 613,000 Global Subscribers.

   Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our Connected
   Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue. We have
   experienced significant growth in sales of our Connected Fitness
   Products, which, when combined with our low Average Net Monthly
   Connected Fitness Churn has led to significant growth in Connected
   Fitness Subscribers. From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019, total revenue
   grew 110%, and our Connected Fitness Subscriber base grew 108%.

   For fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019:


     

   We generated total revenue of $218.6 million, $435.0 million, and
   $915.0 million, respectively, representing 99.0% and 110.3%
   year-over-year growth;


     

   As of June 30, 2017, June 30, 2018, and June 30, 2019, we had 107,708,
   245,667, and 511,202 Connected Fitness Subscribers, respectively,
   representing 128.1% and 108.1% year-over-year growth;


     

   Our Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn was 0.70%, 0.64%, and
   0.65%, respectively;


     

   We incurred net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and
   $(195.6) million, respectively; and


     

   Our Adjusted EBITDA was $(51.8) million, $(30.4) million, and $(71.3)
   million, respectively.

   For a definition of Connected Fitness Subscribers, Average Net Monthly
   Connected Fitness Churn, Subscription Contribution Margin, and Adjusted
   EBITDA, see the section titled Key Operational and Business Metrics.

   See the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other
   DataNon-GAAP Financial Measures for information regarding our use of
   Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA.

   As a supplement to our key operational and business metrics described
   herein, we also measure our number of Members to understand the scale
   of our platform and market penetration. Unlike our number of Connected
   Fitness Subscriptions or Digital Subscriptions, a Member represents a
   single individual who has a Peloton account. It is often the case that
   a Connected Fitness Subscription or Digital Subscription is used by
   multiple members of a single family that each have individual Peloton
   accounts. As of June 30, 2019, we had over 1.4 million Members and the
   average Connected Fitness Subscription was used by 2.0 Members.

   Our Business Model

   Our financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong
   retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer
   acquisition.

   Grow Our Connected Fitness Subscriber Base

   We are still in the early stages of growth. As of June 30, 2019, we had
   sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products globally, a small
   fraction of the 14 million products we believe reflect our SAM in our
   current and announced markets (the United States, the United Kingdom,
   Canada, and Germany) and current fitness product verticals. We believe
   our success in growing our Connected Fitness Subscriber base is due to
   our data-driven marketing and education-based multi-channel sales
   efforts, word-of-mouth referrals from our loyal Members, and broadening
   customer demographics. In order to grow our Connected Fitness
   Subscriber base, we plan to drive sales of our Connected Fitness
   Products by continuing to increase consumer awareness through brand and
   product marketing, the introduction of new Connected Fitness Products
   in existing and new fitness and wellness verticals, and geographical
   expansion.

   In addition to our Connected Fitness Subscription for $39.00 per month,
   we also offer a Digital Subscription for $19.49 per month. As of
   June 30, 2019, we had approximately 102,000 Digital Subscribers. In
   2018, we relaunched Peloton Digital

   when we expanded our content offering to include bootcamp and
   indoor/outdoor running and walking classes. Later in 2018, we
   significantly expanded our yoga content offering and launched
   meditation. While we believe we can grow our Digital Subscriber base
   over time, the focus of Peloton Digital today is to increase engagement
   with our Connected Fitness Subscribers. In addition, Peloton Digital
   provides users an opportunity to try Peloton content before they
   purchase a Connected Fitness Product.

   Increase Engagement to Drive High Retention

   By making fitness fun and motivating, we help our Members achieve their
   personal goals. We continuously improve our platform, which results in
   increased usage of our Connected Fitness Products and Peloton Digital.
   We analyze millions of workouts per month to help us develop new
   software features that improve our Member experience, as well as create
   new on-trend fitness and wellness content. We also develop innovative
   fitness programs and goal-based challenges to help Members feel more
   accountable and motivated. As our community of Members continues to
   grow, the Peloton fitness experience becomes more inspiring, more
   competitive, more immersive, and more connected, fueling the desire of
   each of our Members to achieve their fitness goals.

   Engagement is the leading indicator of retention for our Connected
   Fitness Subscribers. We have consistently seen an increase in Average
   Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber. Total Workouts
   completed by our Connected Fitness Subscribers have grown significantly
   over the past few years. We evaluate engagement on a year-over-year
   basis given the seasonality in our Members workout patterns. Our third
   quarter tends to have elevated workout levels due to New Years
   resolutions and colder weather. Our first quarter tends to have lower
   workout levels as Members enjoy outdoor-based fitness activities and
   summer vacations.

   For a definition of Workouts, Total Workouts, and Average Monthly
   Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber, see the section titled Key
   Operational and Business Metrics.

                                    LOGO

   We have seen an increase in engagement over time, across our cohorts of
   Connected Fitness Subscribers. Average Monthly Workouts per Connected
   Fitness Subscriber are higher for our most recent cohorts and
   engagement for each cohort has been consistent or improved over time.
   For example, the fiscal 2017 cohort includes all Connected Fitness
   Subscribers who joined Peloton between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017.

   Improve Profitability through Scaling Content Platform

   The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base will
   allow us to improve Subscription Contribution Margin, increase
   Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, and generate operating
   leverage. We will be able to leverage a significant portion of our
   content creation costs given that we only need a limited number of
   production studios and instructors to support our growth.

   We measure Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution
   Margin to understand and evaluate the profitability of our subscription
   business and Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. For a
   definition of Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution
   Margin, see the section titled Key Operational and Business Metrics.
   Our subscription gross margin for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 was 9.7%,
   43.3%, and 42.7%, respectively. The increase in our subscription gross
   margin from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by content
   costs for past use, which, while relatively flat on an aggregate dollar
   basis, more adversely impacted subscription gross margin for fiscal
   2017 given a lower Connected Fitness Subscriber base. We also drove
   further margin improvements in fiscal 2018 by leveraging fixed costs of
   content production while expanding our Connected Fitness Subscriber
   base. Subscription gross margin decreased during fiscal 2019 as we
   began to make significant investments in Tread content as well as
   expansion into new content verticals. We also began incurring expenses
   for our new production studios in New York City and London and incurred
   additional content costs for past use in fiscal 2019. Our Subscription
   Contribution Margin for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 was 13.5%, 47.5%,
   and 50.8%, respectively. When excluding content costs for past use, in
   fiscal 2019 we experienced a decline in our Subscription Contribution
   Margin which was driven by additional investments in new content
   verticals in the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019.
   See the section titled Content Costs for Past Use for additional
   information. To support the launch of our Tread, we leased a new studio
   in New York City and added hundreds of original programs including
   bootcamp and indoor/outdoor running and walking classes. In late 2018,
   we significantly expanded our


                                     63
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   yoga offering and launched meditation. We view the majority of these
   costs as fixed and scalable over time as we grow our Subscriber base.
   For a discussion of these recent growth initiatives see the section
   titled Factors Affecting Our PerformanceAbility to Invest.

   We expect to benefit from continued efficiencies in sales and marketing
   expenses resulting from increasing brand awareness, word-of-mouth
   referrals from our growing Member base, and further optimization of our
   sales and marketing investments by channel. We also expect to achieve
   operating leverage as we scale fixed general and administrative
   expenses, including those associated with our new headquarters in New
   York City.

   Maintain Compelling Unit Economics

   Our unit economic model benefits from low Average Net Monthly Connected
   Fitness Churn and high Subscription Contribution Margin. When we
   acquire a new Connected Fitness Subscriber, we offset sales and
   marketing investments with the gross profit earned on the sale of
   Connected Fitness Products, allowing for rapid payback. Thereafter, we
   earn recurring, high-margin subscription revenue. To illustrate our
   compelling unit economic model, we have presented our Connected Fitness
   Subscriber Lifetime Value and Net Customer Acquisition costs for fiscal
   2017, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019.

   We have a high Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, which can
   be calculated as:


     

   our monthly Connected Fitness Subscription fee of $39.00; multiplied by


     

   Connected Fitness Subscribers added in a period; multiplied by


     

   months of Subscription Lifetime implied by our Average Net Monthly
   Connected Fitness Churn in the period (calculated by dividing one by
   our Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn); multiplied by


     

   (Subscription Contribution plus content costs for past use) divided by
   subscription revenue.

   Our Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value for fiscal 2017, fiscal
   2018, and fiscal 2019, was $267.1 million, $604.4 million, and $1,053.8
   million, respectively, or $3,433, $4,015, and $3,593 per Connected
   Fitness Subscriber, respectively.

   As we expand our content offering, develop new interactive software
   features, and grow our community of Members, we believe we can maintain
   a low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, resulting in a high
   Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. In addition, with the
   growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base over time, we expect to
   improve our Subscription Contribution Margin as we scale our fixed
   content production costs.

   Net Customer Acquisition Cost (profit) can be calculated as Adjusted
   Sales and Marketing Expense (which excludes depreciation and
   amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense) less
   Adjusted Connected Fitness Product Gross Profit (which excludes
   depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation
   expense). Our Net Customer Acquisition Costs (profit) for fiscal 2017,
   fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019, was $14.2 million, $(4.9) million, and
   $1.6 million, respectively, or $183, $(33), and $5 per Connected
   Fitness Subscriber added, respectively. We believe we will continue to
   drive rapid payback and efficiencies in Net Customer Acquisition Costs
   (profit) by further leveraging sales and marketing investments as a
   result of heightened brand awareness and growing word-of-mouth
   referrals. Changes in Connected Fitness Product margins or sales and
   marketing expenses may result in an inability to fully offset our
   customer acquisition costs.

   Factors Affecting Our Performance

   Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will
   continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the
   following:

   Ability to Attract New Connected Fitness Subscribers and Scale Our
   Platform

   Our long-term growth will depend in part on our continued ability to
   attract new Connected Fitness Subscribers. We are still in the early
   stages of growth in our existing markets and believe we can
   significantly grow our Connected Fitness Subscriber base. If we cannot
   attract new Connected Fitness Subscribers as quickly as we expect, our
   operating results may be adversely affected. The inability to grow our
   Connected Fitness Subscriber base would reduce efficiency in customer
   acquisition costs and slow operating margin improvement.


                                     64
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   To increase affordability and expand our addressable market, we offer
   attractive financing programs for qualified customers. We report
   revenue net of third-party financing partner fees. Accordingly, to the
   extent that these third-party financing partner fees change, or the
   number of products purchased through our financing programs fluctuates,
   our revenue and Subscription Contribution Margin will be affected.

   Ability to Engage and Retain Our Existing Connected Fitness Subscribers

   Our long-term growth will partially depend on our continued ability to
   retain existing Connected Fitness Subscribers. Engagement is the
   leading indicator of retention for our Connected Fitness Subscribers,
   and we must continue to provide an experience that our Members love. We
   cannot be sure that we will be successful in engaging and retaining
   Connected Fitness Subscribers, or that retention levels will not
   materially decline due to any number of factors, such as harm to our
   brand, or our inability to anticipate and meet consumer preferences and
   successfully implement new software features and content to meet those
   demands.

   Ability to Invest

   We will continue to make investments across our business to drive
   growth, and therefore we expect expenses to increase. We will continue
   to invest significant resources in sales and marketing to drive demand
   for our products and services. We will also continue to invest in
   research and development to enhance our platform, develop new Connected
   Fitness Products and software features, update and expand our content
   offering, and improve our infrastructure. For example, during fiscal
   2019, we added eight new instructors and opened a temporary New York
   City production studio to produce bootcamp and indoor/outdoor running
   and walking classes. To support our rapid growth, we also intend to
   continue investing in our supply chain and logistics operations. We
   have in the past made, and may also in the future make, acquisitions or
   investments in strategic partnerships to further drive our growth. As
   cost of revenue, operating expenses, and capital expenditures increase
   as we invest in our business for long-term growth, we are likely to
   experience additional losses, delaying our ability to achieve
   profitability and adversely affecting cash flows.

   Ability to Grow in New Geographies

   Entering new geographic markets requires us to invest in sales and
   marketing, infrastructure, and personnel, including by establishing
   additional offices, showrooms, and potentially smaller local production
   studios. Our international growth will depend on our ability to sell
   Connected Fitness Products and associated Connected Fitness
   Subscriptions in international markets. Our international expansion has
   resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs and is
   subject to a variety of risks, including local competition, content
   localization, multilingual customer support, potentially complex
   delivery logistics, and compliance with foreign laws and regulations.

   Seasonality

   Historically, we have experienced higher revenue in the second and
   third quarters of the fiscal year compared to other quarters, due in
   large part to seasonal holiday demand, New Years resolutions, and cold
   weather. For example, in fiscal 2018 and 2019, our second and third
   quarters combined each represented 63% and 63% of our total revenue. We
   also incur higher sales and marketing expenses during these periods,
   which we expect to continue.

   Please see the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and
   Other DataNon-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of net
   loss to Adjusted EBITDA and an explanation for why we consider Adjusted
   EBITDA to be a helpful metric for investors.

   Connected Fitness Subscribers

   Our ability to expand the number of Connected Fitness Subscribers is an
   indicator of our market penetration and growth. A Connected Fitness
   Subscriber can represent a person, household or commercial property,
   such as a hotel or residential building.

   A Connected Fitness Subscription is either a paid Connected Fitness
   Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription with a successful credit
   card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers) or paused
   Connected Fitness Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription where
   the Subscriber has requested to Pause for up to 3 months). We do not
   include canceled or unpaid Connected Fitness Subscriptions in the
   Connected Fitness Subscriber count.

   Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn

   We use Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn to measure the
   retention of our Connected Fitness Subscribers. We define Average Net
   Monthly Connected Fitness Churn as Connected Fitness Subscriber
   cancellations, net of reactivations, in the quarter, divided by the
   average number of beginning Connected Fitness Subscribers in each
   month, divided by three months. This metric does not include data
   related to our Digital Subscribers.

   Total Workouts and Average Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness
   Subscriber

   We review Total Workouts and Average Monthly Workouts per Connected
   Fitness Subscriber to measure engagement, which is the leading
   indicator of retention for our Connected Fitness Subscribers. We define
   Total Workouts as all workouts completed during a given period. We
   define a Workout as a Connected Fitness Subscriber either completing at
   least 50% of an instructor-led or scenic ride or run or ten or more
   minutes of Just Ride or Just Run mode. We define Average Monthly
   Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber as the Total Workouts
   completed in the quarter divided by the average number of Connected
   Fitness Subscribers in each month, divided by three months.

   Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin

   We use Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin
   to measure our ability to scale and leverage the costs of our Connected
   Fitness Subscriptions and measure Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime
   Value. The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base
   will allow us to improve our Subscription Contribution Margin and


                                     66
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   aggregate Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. While there are
   variable costs, including music royalties, associated with our
   Connected Fitness Subscriptions, a significant portion of our content
   creation costs are fixed given that we operate with a limited number of
   production studios and instructors. The fixed nature of those expenses
   should scale over time as we grow our Connected Fitness Subscriber
   base.

   We define Subscription Contribution as subscription revenue less cost
   of subscription revenue, adjusted to exclude depreciation and
   amortization expense, and stock-based compensation expense.
   Subscription Contribution Margin is calculated by dividing Subscription
   Contribution by subscription revenue. See the section titled Selected
   Consolidated Financial and Other DataSubscription Contribution and
   Subscription Contribution Margin for information regarding our use of
   Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin and a
   reconciliation of Subscription Contribution to subscription gross
   profit.

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin

   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are key performance measures
   that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the
   operating leverage in our business. Because Adjusted EBITDA and
   Adjusted EBITDA Margin facilitate internal comparisons of our
   historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use
   these measures for business planning purposes. We also believe this
   information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of
   our operating performance and better identify trends in our business.
   We expect Adjusted EBITDA Margin to increase over the long-term as we
   continue to scale our business and achieve greater leverage in our
   operating expenses.

   We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude other
   (expense) income, provision for (benefit from) income taxes,
   depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation
   expense, transaction costs, certain litigation expenses, consisting of
   legal settlements and related fees for specific proceedings that arise
   outside of the ordinary course of our business, and non-cash ground
   lease expense related to build-to-suit obligations. Adjusted EBITDA
   Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. See
   the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other
   DataAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for information
   regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted
   EBITDA to net loss.

   Components of our Operating Results

   We operate and manage our business in three reportable segments:
   Connected Fitness Products, Subscription, and Other. We identify our
   reportable segments based on the information used by management to
   monitor performance and make operating decisions. See Note 17 of the
   notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
   this prospectus for additional information regarding our reportable
   segments.

   Revenue

   Connected Fitness Products

   Connected Fitness Product revenue consists of sales of our Bike and
   Tread and related accessories, associated fees for delivery and
   installation, and extended warranty agreements. Connected Fitness
   Product revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and is recorded
   net of returns and discounts and third-party financing program fees.

   Subscription

   Subscription revenue consists of revenue generated from our monthly
   $39.00 Connected Fitness Subscription and $19.49 Digital Subscription.
   Subscription revenue also includes revenue generated from guests who
   pay to take a live class in one of our studios, which has been
   immaterial to date.

   Historically, we offered a prepaid subscription option where Members
   earned one free month or three free months of subscription with the
   upfront purchase of a 12-month subscription or 24-month subscription,
   respectively. We also offered Connected Fitness Subscribers the ability
   to purchase a 12-, 24-, or 39-month prepaid subscription with the
   purchase of a Connected Fitness Product as part of our financing
   program, which provides 0% APR financing to qualified customers over a
   term of up to 39 months. The associated financing fees are paid to our
   third-party partner at the outset of the arrangement and are recorded
   as a reduction to Subscription revenue over the contract term. We
   terminated both offerings by July 2018 at which point all subsequent
   future subscriptions became month-to-month; however, we will continue
   to see an impact to subscription revenue until fiscal 2022 as the
   revenue under legacy prepaid subscriptions is earned ratably over the
   remaining service period, which extends up to 39 months from the
   initial date of subscription activation.


                                     67
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   Other

   Other revenue primarily consists of Peloton branded apparel.

   Cost of Revenue

   Connected Fitness Products

   Connected Fitness Product cost of revenue consists of Bike and Tread
   product costs, including manufacturing costs, duties and other
   applicable importing costs, shipping and handling costs, packaging,
   warranty replacement costs, fulfillment costs, warehousing costs, and
   certain allocated costs related to management, facilities, and
   personnel-related expenses associated with supply chain logistics. As
   we launch new Connected Fitness Products, such as the Tread, and
   continue to grow our presence in new regions where we have not yet
   achieved economies of scale, we expect to incur higher cost of revenue
   (as a percentage of sales) for our Connected Fitness Products.

   Subscription

   Subscription cost of revenue includes costs associated with content
   creation and costs to stream content to our Members. These costs
   consist of both fixed costs, including studio rent and occupancy, other
   studio overhead, instructor and production personnel-related expenses,
   as well as variable costs, including music royalty fees, content costs
   for past use, third-party platform streaming costs and payment
   processing fees for our monthly subscription billings. While our fixed
   costs currently represent the majority of these costs, music royalty
   fees are our largest subscription variable cost. As we have grown the
   number of licensing agreements with music rights holders, music royalty
   fees as a percent of our subscription revenue has
   increased. However, unlike music streaming services where having an
   exhaustive music catalog is vital to be able to compete for customers,
   we have control over what music we select for our classes. As a result,
   we expect to be able to manage music expense such that, over time,
   these fees as a percentage of subscription revenue will flatten, or
   even decrease.

   Other

   Other cost of revenue consists primarily of apparel costs, as well as
   related warehousing and fulfillment costs.

   Operating Expenses

   Research and Development

   Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel and
   facilities-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses,
   tooling and prototype materials, and software platform expenses. We
   capitalize certain qualified costs incurred in connection with the
   development of internal-use software which may also cause research and
   development expenses to vary from period to period. We expect our
   research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in
   future periods and vary from period to period as a percentage of total
   revenue as we continue to hire personnel to develop new and enhance
   existing Connected Fitness Products and interactive software.

   Sales and Marketing

   Sales and marketing expense consists of performance marketing media
   spend, asset creation, and other brand creative, all showroom expenses
   and related lease payments, payment processing fees incurred in
   connection with the sale of our Connected Fitness Products, sales and
   marketing personnel-related expenses, and all expenses related to
   Peloton Digital. We intend to continue to invest in our sales and
   marketing capabilities in the future and expect this expense to
   increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we release new
   products and expand internationally. Sales and marketing expense as a
   percentage of total revenue may fluctuate from period to period based
   on total revenue and the timing of our investments in our sales and
   marketing functions as these investments may vary in scope and scale
   over future periods.

   General and Administrative

   General and administrative expense includes personnel-related expenses
   and facilities-related costs primarily for our executive, finance,
   accounting, legal, human resources, and IT functions. General and
   administrative expense also includes fees for professional services
   principally comprised of legal, audit, tax and accounting services, and
   insurance.

   Following the completion of this offering, we expect to incur
   additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating
   as a public company, including expenses related to compliance and
   reporting obligations of public companies,


                                     68
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   and increased costs for insurance, investor relations expenses, and
   professional services. As a result, we expect that our general and
   administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future
   periods and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue, but
   we expect to leverage these expenses over time as we grow our revenue
   and Connected Fitness Subscriber base.

   Other (Expense) Income, Net

   Other (expense) income, net consists of interest (expense) income
   associated with our debt financing arrangements, amortization of debt
   issuance costs and interest income earned on investments.

   Provision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes

   The provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of
   income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we
   conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal
   and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more
   likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized.

   Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation Expense

   Tender Offers

   In April 2017, we commenced a cash tender offer, which was completed in
   June 2017, for the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock
   and redeemable convertible preferred stock from existing stockholders,
   including current and former employees, which had a significant impact
   on our stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2017. In the 2017
   tender offer, we repurchased an aggregate of 9,661,156 shares of our
   capital stock. The purchase price per share in the tender offer was in
   excess of the fair value of our outstanding common stock at the time of
   the transaction and accordingly, upon the completion of the
   transaction, we recorded $8.3 million as stock-based compensation
   expense related to the excess of the selling price per share of common
   stock paid to our employees over the fair value of the tendered
   shares.

   In August 2018, we commenced a cash tender offer, which was completed
   in October 2018, for the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common
   stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock from existing
   stockholders, including current and former employees, which had a
   significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense for fiscal
   2019. In the 2018 tender offer, we repurchased an aggregate of
   9,264,518 shares of our capital stock. The purchase price per share in
   the tender offer was in excess of the fair value of our outstanding
   common stock at the time of the transaction and accordingly, upon the
   completion of the transaction, we recorded $28.2 million as stock-based
   compensation expense related to the excess of the selling price per
   share of common stock paid to our employees over the fair value of the
   tendered shares.

   Additionally, for shares held less than six months and thus deemed to
   not be subject to market risks, we recorded a liability for the maximum
   number of shares that were eligible for the tender offer when it became
   probable that the event allowing for the redemption would occur. To the
   extent that this liability exceeded amounts previously recognized in
   equity, the excess was recognized as compensation cost. As a result of
   this liability, we recognized an additional stock-compensation expense
   of $33.5 million. See Note 12 of the notes to our audited consolidated
   financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for
   additional information.

   2018 Compared to 2019

   Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 increased
   $215.8 million, or 110.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was
   primarily driven by costs associated with the growth in the number of
   Connected Fitness Products delivered during the period.

   Our Connected Fitness Products gross margin decreased slightly due to
   the increasing mix of deliveries of Tread, partially offset by cost
   efficiencies achieved in the manufacturing of our Bike.

   Subscription cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $58.2 million,
   or 127.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily driven
   by an increase of $23.1 million in music royalty and streaming delivery
   fees driven by increased usage of our platform, an increase of
   $14.0 million in personnel-related expenses due to our introduction of
   the Tread and other new fitness and wellness verticals such as yoga and
   meditation, and expansion into the United Kingdom, an increase of
   $8.5 million in depreciation and amortization expense driven by our
   acquired developed technology, and an increase of $4.6 million in
   occupancy costs associated with lease commencement for our two new
   production studios in New York City and London.

   Subscription gross margin decreased by 53 basis points from fiscal 2018
   to fiscal 2019 as we invested in new initiatives discussed above,
   partially offset by leveraging the fixed costs of content production as
   we scaled our Connected Fitness Subscriber base. Included in
   subscription cost of revenue are content costs for past use of $14.5
   million and $16.4 million for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively. These
   costs had a negative basis point impact on subscription gross margin of
   1,805 and 908 for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively.

   Other cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $12.1 million, or
   247.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily
   attributable to the growth of our branded apparel sales during the
   period as well as an increase in our apparel inventory reserves.

   Other gross margin decreased during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
   due to an increase in our apparel inventory reserves.

   2017 Compared to 2018

   Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 increased
   $81.5 million, or 71.7%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was
   primarily driven by the growth in the number of Connected Fitness
   Products delivered during the period. We gained significant
   efficiencies in manufacturing costs resulting in a 592 basis point
   improvement in Connected Fitness Product gross margin from fiscal 2017
   to fiscal 2018.

   Subscription cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $16.2 million,
   or 55.4%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily driven
   by a $10.9 million increase in music royalty and streaming delivery
   fees, a $2.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses as we
   continued to grow our content offering for the Tread, and a $1.6
   million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. We also
   incurred an additional $1.3 million in production studio occupancy
   costs primarily attributable to the opening of a second production
   studio in June 2017 to support Tread content creation.

   Subscription gross margin significantly improved by 3,356 basis points
   from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. This was primarily driven by the
   impact of content costs for past use of $15.5 million and $14.5 million
   for fiscal 2017 and 2018, respectively, which more adversely impacted
   gross margin for fiscal 2017 given the lower Connected Fitness
   Subscriber base. These content costs for past use had a negative basis
   point impact on subscription gross margin of 4,788 and 1,805 for fiscal
   2017 and 2018, respectively. We drove further margin improvements by
   leveraging fixed costs of content production while scaling our
   Connected Fitness Subscriber base in fiscal 2018.

   Other cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $3.0 million, or
   163.3%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily
   attributable to the growth of our branded apparel sales.

   2018 Compared to 2019

   Research and development expense for fiscal 2019 increased
   $31.5 million, or 134.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was
   due primarily to an increase in personnel-related expenses, which,
   excluding stock-based compensation expense, increased $16.8 million,
   due to increased headcount. Stock-based compensation expense increased
   $6.3 million, of which $3.8 million was related to incremental costs
   associated with the tender offer completed in October 2018.

   2017 Compared to 2018

   Research and development expenses for fiscal 2018 increased
   $10.3 million, or 79.1%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was due
   primarily to increases of $3.9 million in product development and
   research costs, $3.3 million in personnel-related expenses, excluding
   stock-based compensation expense, resulting from increased headcount,
   and $1.1 million in web hosting fees to create new, as well as improve
   existing products and interactive software features on our platform.

   2018 Compared to 2019

   Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2019 increased $172.6 million,
   or 114.1%, compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was due primarily to
   increased spending of $117.4 million on advertising and marketing
   programs. In addition, personnel-related expenses, excluding
   stock-based compensation expense, increased by $22.2 million due to
   increased headcount, expenses related to our showrooms and microstores
   increased by $15.3 million due to our addition of 39 global retail
   locations, and stock-based compensation expense increased $7.7 million,
   of which $6.2 million was related to incremental costs associated with
   the tender offer completed in October 2018.

   2017 Compared to 2018

   Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2018 increased $65.4 million, or
   76.0%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily driven by
   $44.3 million in increased marketing costs, $8.2 million of increased
   personnel-related expenses, $5.4 million of increased payment
   processing fees, and $5.2 million of additional costs related to 12
   additional retail locations we added in the period.

   2018 Compared to 2019

   General and administrative expense for fiscal 2019 increased
   $144.6 million, or 231.5%, compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was
   due primarily to an increase of $64.1 million in stock-based
   compensation expense, of which $50.6 million related to the tender
   offer completed in October 2018. Professional fees, comprised of legal,
   accounting, and consulting fees, increased by $24.4 million. In
   addition, personnel-related expenses, excluding stock-based
   compensation expense, increased by $22.7 million due to increased
   headcount. We also incurred an additional $8.4 million expense relating
   to new system implementations and software licenses to support our
   growth and scale our operations, and facilities costs increased
   $12.9 million, of which $7.2 million was lease expense related to
   build-to-suit obligations.

   2017 Compared to 2018

   General and administrative expense for fiscal 2018 increased
   $16.8 million, or 36.8%, compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was
   primarily due to an additional $6.5 million in professional services
   fees, $6.4 million in personnel-related expenses, excluding stock-based
   compensation expense, due to increased headcount, $2.5 million in new
   system implementations and licenses to support our growth and scale our
   operations, and $2.3 million of facilities costs from additional leased
   office space. These costs were partially offset by a decrease of
   $3.0 million in stock-based compensation expense due to an incremental
   $8.3 million charge incurred in fiscal 2017 related to the tender offer
   completed in June 2017.

   Other (expense) income, net, was $6.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared
   to $(0.3) million for fiscal 2018. The increase in other (expense)
   income, net, was primarily due to $8.2 million of interest earned on
   cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, partially offset by
   a $1.0 million increase in interest expense incurred under our Credit
   Agreement.

   in interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
   was partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in interest expense

   Quarterly Trends

   Revenue

   Our revenue from our Connected Fitness Products typically varies
   seasonally and we have historically experienced higher levels of
   Connected Fitness Products revenue in the second and third quarters of
   each fiscal year as compared to other quarters due in large part to
   seasonal holiday demand, New Years resolutions, and cold weather.

   Subscription revenue increased in each of the quarters presented
   primarily due to Connected Fitness Subscriber growth and low Average
   Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn.

   Cost of Revenue

   Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue has fluctuated in line with
   Connected Fitness Products revenue for all periods presented due
   primarily to costs associated with sales of Connected Fitness Products.

   Our subscription cost of revenue generally increased each quarter as a
   result of increases in music royalties, streaming, and platform costs,
   as well as payment processing fees. We saw fluctuations in the third
   quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due to content costs for past
   use.

   Operating Expenses

   Research and development expense increased for all periods presented,
   primarily due to personnel-related expenses as we have continued to
   increase our headcount to support product and platform innovation.

Table of Contents

   Sales and marketing expense increased in the second and third quarter
   of each fiscal year due to an increase in expenses associated with
   advertising costs and other marketing programs for the holiday season.
   In addition, sales and marketing expenses increased as a result of
   higher personnel-related expenses and occupancy costs as we increased
   headcount and number of showrooms to support our growth.

   General and administrative expense generally increased for all periods
   presented, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses,
   facilities costs, and professional service fees as we grow our business
   and scale operations. We saw a significant increase in general and
   administrative expenses in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019
   related to stock-based compensation expense associated with the tender
   offer completed in October 2018.

   Starting in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we began to incur
   significant costs related to certain growth initiatives including the
   introduction of our Tread, international expansion, and content
   investments which had an adverse impact on our Adjusted EBITDA. To
   support our growth, we have also begun to make investments in supply
   chain, product development, and a new headquarters in New York City
   which we expect will continue to impact our Adjusted EBITDA Margin.
   Adjusted EBITDA was also more adversely impacted in certain quarters
   presented due to the variable nature of our content costs for past use.
   See the section titled Content Costs for Past Use for additional
   information.

   Our Subscription Contribution Margin has fluctuated over time due, in
   part, to the variable nature of our content costs for past use. See the
   section titled Content Costs for Past Use. Excluding content costs
   for past use, Subscription Contribution increased in each of the
   quarters presented primarily due to the growth of our Connected Fitness
   Subscriber base and our continued low Average Net Monthly Connected
   Fitness Churn. Excluding content costs for past use, Subscription
   Contribution Margin increased quarterly through September 30, 2018 as
   we continued to leverage our fixed content costs across our growing
   Connected Fitness Subscriber base. In the subsequent quarters we began
   to make significant investments in Tread content, including the leasing
   of a Tread studio, as well as expansion into new content verticals such
   as yoga and meditation. Starting in the quarter ended December 31,
   2018, our Subscription Contribution costs also include rent expense for
   our new production studio in New York City, which caused our
   Subscription Contribution Margin to decline. Starting in the quarter
   ended March 31, 2019, our Subscription Contribution costs also include
   rent expense for our new London studio. In the quarter ended June 30,
   2019, Subscription Contribution Margin increased and we expect to
   continue to leverage the largely fixed costs of our studio production
   as we scale our Connected Fitness Subscriber base.

   Content Costs for Past Use

   Included within Adjusted EBITDA and Subscription Contribution are
   content costs for past use as follows:

   From time-to-time, we execute music royalty agreements with various
   music rights holders. As part of these go-forward license agreements,
   we may also enter into agreements whereby we are released from all
   potential licensor claims regarding our alleged past use of copyrighted
   material in our content in exchange for a mutually-agreed payment. We
   refer to these payments as content costs for past use. These costs can
   vary considerably from quarter to quarter since they represent our
   estimates of potential future release payments based upon license
   agreements previously entered into and the market share and size of the
   music rights holder. These estimates are subject to a variety of
   complex and evolving legal issues across many jurisdictions and are not
   predictable, which can result in fluctuation over time.

   To date, we have entered into numerous agreements with major record
   labels and major publishers, independent labels and publishers, and
   major performing rights organizations to resolve instances of alleged
   past use while entering into go-forward license agreements with each of
   these parties. We have also improved upon a music content management
   and reporting system that allows our instructors to create class
   playlists from a selection of songs licensed to us. Based on these
   efforts, we believe that payments for content costs for past use will
   decrease over time and eventually be eliminated.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources

   Our operations have been financed primarily through cash flow from
   operating activities, net proceeds from the sale of redeemable
   convertible preferred stock and borrowings under our Credit Agreement.
   As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $162.1 million
   and marketable securities of $216.0 million.

   We believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flow
   from operations, marketable securities portfolio, and amounts available
   for borrowing under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our
   working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12
   months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those
   currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate
   of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and
   development efforts and other growth initiatives, the expansion of
   sales and marketing activities, the timing of new Connected Fitness
   Product introductions, market acceptance of our Connected Fitness
   Products, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current
   and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund
   our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to
   seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity
   would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence
   of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the
   instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and
   financing covenants that would restrict our operations. There can be no
   assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. The
   inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to
   achieve our business objectives.

   Amended and Restated Credit Agreement

   In June 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase
   Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, lead arranger and bookrunner and
   Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending
   Partners LLC, and Silicon Valley Bank, as joint syndication agents,
   which amended and restated the loan and security agreement we
   previously entered into in November 2017. The Credit Agreement provides
   for a $250.0 million secured revolving credit facility, including up to
   the lesser of $150.0 million and the aggregate unused amount of the
   facility for the issuance of letters of credit. Interest on the Credit
   Agreement is paid based on LIBOR plus 2.75% or an Alternative Base Rate
   plus 1.75%. We are required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.375%
   on a quarterly basis based on the unused portion of the revolving
   credit facility. The principal amount, if any, is payable in full in
   June 2024. As of June 30, 2019, we had not drawn on the credit facility
   and did not have outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

   We have the option to repay our borrowings under the Credit Agreement
   without premium or penalty prior to maturity. The Credit Agreement
   contains customary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement
   reporting requirements and delivery of borrowing base certificates, as
   well as customary covenants that restrict our ability to, among other
   things, incur additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, guarantee
   obligations of third parties, declare dividends or make certain
   distributions, and undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other
   transactions. The Credit Agreement also contains certain financial
   condition covenants, including maintaining a total level of liquidity
   of not less than $125.0 million and


                                     81

   maintaining certain minimum total revenue ranging from $725 million to
   $1,985 million depending on the applicable date of determination. As of
   June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants under the
   Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2019, we had outstanding letters of
   credit totaling $40.1 million issued primarily to cover security
   deposits for our operating lease and inventory purchase obligations.

   Operating Activities

   Net cash used in operating activities of $(108.6) million for fiscal
   2019 was primarily due to a net loss of $195.6 million and a decrease
   in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $22.9 million,
   partially offset by non-cash adjustments of $109.8 million. The
   decrease in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to
   an $111.3 million increase in inventory levels as a result of our
   introduction of the Peloton Tread, as well as our expansion into the
   United Kingdom and Canada, and a $30.3 million increase in prepaid
   expenses and other current assets driven by general growth; partially
   offset by an $117.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued
   expenses related to increased expenditures to support general business
   growth. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based
   compensation expense of $89.5 million of which $61.7 million related to
   a tender offer completed in October 2018.

   Net cash provided by operating activities of $49.7 million for fiscal
   2018 was primarily due to an increase in net change in operating assets
   and liabilities of $81.5 million and non-cash adjustments of
   $16.1 million, partially offset by a net loss of $47.9 million. The
   increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities was
   primarily due to a $63.0 million increase in deferred revenue
   associated with our prior Subscription offering launched in October
   2017 whereby customers could purchase a subscription upfront for a
   39-month term as well as overall growth in our sales of Connected
   Fitness Products, and a $41.0 million increase in accounts payable and
   accrued expenses related to growth of expenditures to support general
   business growth; partially offset by a $9.6 million increase in
   inventory levels and a $12.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and
   other current assets driven by general growth. Non-cash adjustments
   primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense and
   depreciation and amortization expense.

   Net cash used in operating activities of $18.6 million for fiscal 2017
   was primarily due to a net loss of $71.1 million, partially offset by
   an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of
   $38.2 million and non-cash adjustments of $14.3 million. The increase
   in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to
   a $22.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses
   related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth,
   and a $19.0 million increase in deferred revenue associated with
   overall growth in our sales of Connected Fitness Products. Non-cash
   adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense.

   Investing Activities

   Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 of $297.5 million was
   primarily related to the purchase of marketable securities of
   $249.8 million and capital expenditures of $83.0 million, partially
   offset by maturities of marketable securities of $36.0 million.

   Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 of $56.7 million was
   due to the cash portion of the acquisition of Neurotic Media of
   $28.7 million, net of cash acquired, and cash used of $28.0 million for
   capital expenditures. We acquired Neurotic Media primarily to automate
   and streamline content rights management and to enhance Member
   engagement through new music features. Of the total purchase
   consideration, $4.2 million has been recorded to goodwill,
   $24.8 million to acquired developed technology, and $0.1 million in
   tangible net assets.

   Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 of $10.2 million for
   capital expenditures.

   Financing Activities

   Net cash provided by financing activities of $417.2 million for fiscal
   2019 was primarily related to net proceeds from issuance of Series F
   redeemable convertible preferred stock of $408.8 million, net of
   issuance costs and repurchases of common stock and preferred stock, as
   well as $9.3 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options.

   Net cash provided by financing activities of $3.1 million for fiscal
   2018 was primarily related to proceeds from exercises of stock options
   of $7.4 million, partially offset by $4.3 million in debt repayment and
   issuance costs.

   Net cash provided by financing activities of $143.6 million for fiscal
   2017 was primarily related to net proceeds from issuance of Series E
   redeemable convertible preferred stock of $145.6 million, net of
   issuance costs and repurchases of common stock and preferred stock, as
   well as proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility of
   $10.5 million. These amounts were partially offset by the $13.0 million
   debt repayment of our term loan and revolver.

   Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments

   The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of
   June 30, 2019:

   (1)

   Operating lease obligations relate to our office space, warehouses,
   production studios, and retail showrooms and microstores. The lease
   terms are between one and twenty-one years, and the majority of the
   lease agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period.


   (2)

   We are subject to minimum royalty payments associated with our license
   agreements for the use of licensed content. See Risk FactorsRisks
   Related to Our BusinessWe are party to many music license agreements
   that are complex and impose numerous obligations upon us that may make
   it difficult to operate our business, and a breach of such agreements
   could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial
   condition.


   (3)

   We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% based on the unused
   portion of the revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2019, we were
   contingently liable for approximately $40.1 million in standby letters
   of credit as security for our operating lease obligations.

   The commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts
   that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all
   significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used,
   fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing
   of the actions under the contracts.

   Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and
   services are not included in the table. We cannot determine the
   aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual
   obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to
   purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based
   on our current needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers and
   manufacturers within short periods of time. We subcontract with other
   companies to manufacture our products. During the normal course of
   business, we and our manufacturers procure components based upon a
   forecasted production plan. If we cancel all or part of the orders, we
   may be liable to our suppliers and manufacturers for the cost of the
   unutilized component orders or components purchased by our
   manufacturers.

   In December 2017, we entered into a 21-year operating lease agreement
   for our new fitness programming hub in New York City. This lease
   commenced in October 2018, upon the date we took possession of the
   leased space and committed to make $99.5 million in minimum fixed
   payments over the term of the lease agreement, although cash payments
   for rental obligations under the lease do not begin until October 2019.
   This lease contains a renewal option for two additional five-year
   periods and includes a tenant improvement allowance of $3.0 million.

   In November 2018, we entered into a 16-year operating lease agreement
   for space to be used as our new corporate headquarters in New York
   City. This lease is expected to commence in August 2019 when we take
   possession of the leased space and commit to pay $503.0 million in
   minimum fixed payments over the term of the lease. This lease contains
   a renewal option for an additional 10-year period and includes a tenant
   improvement allowance of $28.0 million.

   Between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020, the end of our 2020 fiscal
   year, we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $250.0
   million to $300.0 million, which will be largely attributable to the
   build out of our new headquarters in New York City, our investment in
   developing our New York and London production studios, and an increase
   in the number of showrooms that we operate.

   In June 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire a third party for
   approximately $50.0 million. The agreement is subject to standard
   closing conditions and third-party approvals. We expect to close the
   transaction in September 2019.

   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

   We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2019.

   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

   Interest Rate Risk

   We are primarily exposed to changes in short-term interest rates with
   respect to our cost of borrowing under our Credit Agreement. We monitor
   our cost of borrowing under our facility, taking into account our
   funding requirements, and our expectations for short-term rates in the
   future. A hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate on our Credit
   Agreement for all periods presented would not have a material impact on
   our financial statements.

   Foreign Currency Risk

   To date, all of our inventory purchases have been denominated in U.S.
   dollars. Our international sales are primarily denominated in foreign
   currencies and any unfavorable movement in the exchange rate between
   U.S. dollars and the currencies in which we conduct sales in foreign
   countries could have an adverse impact on our revenue. A portion of our
   operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are
   denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to
   fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In
   addition, our suppliers incur many costs, including labor and supply
   costs, in other currencies. While we are not currently contractually
   obligated to pay increased costs due to changes in exchange rates, to
   the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably for our suppliers, they
   may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a
   material impact on our gross margins. Our operating results and cash
   flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign
   currency exchange rates. However, we believe that the exposure to
   foreign currency fluctuation from operating expenses is relatively
   small at this time as the related costs do not constitute a significant
   portion of our total expenses. To date, we have not entered into
   derivatives or hedging transactions, as our exposure to foreign
   currency exchange rates has historically been partially hedged as our
   foreign currency denominated inflows have covered our foreign currency
   denominated expenses. However, we may enter into derivative or hedging
   transactions in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should
   become more significant.

   Inflation Risk

   We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our
   business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs
   become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be
   able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our
   inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial
   condition, and operating results.

   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

   Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
   operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
   have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing the
   consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and judgments that
   affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders
   equity/deficit, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We
   re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based
   on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
   believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the
   uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from
   these estimates and could differ based upon other assumptions or
   conditions. The critical accounting policies that reflect our more
   significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
   consolidated financial statements include those noted below.

   Revenue Recognition

   Our primary source of revenues are from sales of our Connected Fitness
   Products including our Bike and Tread, related accessories, and monthly
   Connected Fitness Subscriptions.


                                     84
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   We determine revenue recognition through the following steps in
   accordance with Topic 606 which we adopted as of July 1, 2018 on a full
   retrospective basis:


     

   identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;


     

   identification of the performance obligations in the contract;


     

   determination of the transaction price;


     

   allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in
   the contract; and


     

   recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance
   obligation.

   Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services
   are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the
   consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods
   or services. Our revenue is reported net of sales returns and
   discounts, which to date have not been material to our financial
   statements. We estimate our liability for product returns based on
   historical return trends by product category and seasonality and an
   evaluation of current economic and market conditions, and record the
   expected customer refund liability as a reduction to revenue, and the
   expected inventory right of recovery as a reduction of cost of revenue.
   If actual return costs differ from previous estimates, the amount of
   the liability and corresponding revenue are adjusted in the period in
   which such costs occur.

   Some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance
   obligations. For customer contracts that include multiple performance
   obligations, we account for individual performance obligations if they
   are distinct. The transaction price is then allocated to each
   performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. We
   generally determine standalone selling price based on the prices
   charged to customers.

   Deferred revenue is recorded for nonrefundable cash payments received
   for our performance obligation to transfer or stand ready to transfer,
   goods or services in the future. Deferred revenue consists of
   Subscription fees billed that have not been recognized. Customer
   deposits represent payments received in advance in instances where the
   revenue contract is cancelable in nature, and therefore, we do not have
   an unconditional obligation to transfer control to a customer.

   Product Warranty

   We offer a standard product warranty that our products will operate
   under normal, non-commercial use for a period of one-year from the date
   of original delivery. We have the obligation, at our option, to either
   repair or replace a defective product. At the time revenue is
   recognized, an estimate of future warranty costs is recorded as a
   component of cost of revenue. The estimate of future warranty costs is
   based on historical as well as current product failure rates, service
   delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures, and warranty
   policies. We regularly review these estimates to assess the
   appropriateness of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the
   amounts as necessary. Should actual product failures, use of materials
   or other costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty
   liabilities could be incurred, which could materially affect our
   results of operations. The estimates and assumptions used to reserve
   for product warranty have been accurate in all material respects and
   have not materially changed historically.

   Goodwill and Intangible Assets

   Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration
   transferred and the fair value of any non-controlling interest
   recognized, if any, over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired
   and liabilities assumed in a business combination.

   Intangible assets other than goodwill are comprised of acquired
   developed technology. At initial recognition, intangible assets
   acquired in a business combination are recognized at their fair value
   as of the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition,
   intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and
   impairment losses, if any, and are amortized on a straight-line basis
   over the estimated useful life of the asset, which was determined based
   on managements estimate of the period over which the asset will
   contribute to our future cash flows. We review goodwill for impairment
   annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
   carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In conducting our
   annual goodwill impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to
   determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the
   asset is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the
   fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we perform a
   quantitative impairment assessment of the asset, analyzing the expected
   present value of future cash flows to quantify the amount of
   impairment, if any. We perform our annual impairment tests in the
   fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We assess the impairment of
   intangible assets whenever events or changing circumstances indicate
   that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

   Music Royalty Fees

   We recognize music royalty fees on all music we stream to Members as
   these fees are incurred in accordance with the terms of the relevant
   license agreement with the music rights holder. The incurrence of the
   royalties is primarily driven by content usage by our Members on a
   fee-per-play basis through the use of our Subscriptions and classified
   within subscription cost of revenue within the our statement of
   operations. Our license agreements with music rights holders generally
   include provisions for advance royalties as well as minimum guarantees.
   When a minimum guarantee is paid in advance, the guarantee is recorded
   as a prepaid expense and amortized to subscription cost of revenue.

   As we execute music license agreements with various music rights
   holders for go-forward usage, we may also simultaneously enter into a
   settlement agreement whereby we are released from all potential
   licensor claims regarding our alleged past use of copyrighted material
   in exchange for a negotiated payment. These are referred to as content
   costs for past use and are recorded within subscription cost of
   revenue. We have entered into agreements with music rights holders who
   represent all the music catalogs that we need to operate our service,
   however, given the uncertain and opaque nature of music rights
   ownership, our archived library may continue to include music for which
   certain rights or fractional interests have not been accurately
   determined or fully licensed. Prior to the execution of a music license
   agreement, we estimate and record a charge based upon license
   agreements previously entered into and the market share and size of the
   music rights holder.

   Stock-Based Compensation

   Stock-based awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair
   value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of actual
   forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
   period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.
   For performance-based stock options issued, the value of the instrument
   is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the award and
   expensed over the vesting term when the performance targets are
   considered probable of being achieved.

   We calculate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using
   the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of the grant
   date fair value of stock option awards issued is affected by a number
   of variables, including the fair value of our underlying common stock,
   our expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option
   award, the expected term of the award, risk-free interest rates, and
   the expected dividend yield of our common stock.

   Generally, our stock option awards permit early exercise. The unvested
   portion of shares exercised is recorded as a liability on our balance
   sheet and reclassified to equity as vesting occurs.

   The estimated grant-date fair value of our equity-based awards issued
   to service providers was calculated using the Black-Scholes
   option-pricing model, based on the following assumptions:


                            Fiscal Year Ended June 30,
                              2017                      2018
                                    2019

                               Dividend yield
                                                

                  Weighted-average expected term (in years)
                          6.3          6.3          6.3

                  Weighted-average risk-free interest rate
                           1.4%        2.4%        2.5%

                    Weighted-average expected volatility
                         79.3%        55.2%        45.0%

   Dividend Yield. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have never
   declared or paid cash dividends and have no current plans to do so in
   the foreseeable future.

   Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our
   stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We do not have
   sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon
   which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time
   stock-based awards have been exercisable. As a result, for stock
   options, we used the simplified method to calculate the expected term
   estimate based on the vesting and contractual terms of the option.
   Under the simplified method, the expected term is equal to the average
   of the stock-based awards weighted-average vesting period and its
   contractual term. For awards granted which contain performance
   conditions, we estimate the expected term based on the estimated dates
   that the performance conditions will be satisfied.


                                     86
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the
   U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for
   zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to
   the stock options expected term.

   Expected Volatility. Since we do not have a trading history of our
   common stock, the expected volatility was derived from the average
   historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies
   within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business
   over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards, We intend
   to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or
   similar companies to estimate the expected volatility until sufficient
   historical information regarding the volatility of the share price of
   our Class A common stock becomes available.

   We also grant stock-based awards to non-employees. We believe that for
   stock options issued to non-employees, the fair value of the stock
   option is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the services
   rendered. Therefore, we estimate the fair value of non-employee stock
   options using a Black-Scholes valuation model with appropriate
   assumptions.

   Common Stock Valuations

   In the absence of a public trading market, the fair value of our common
   stock was determined by our board of directors, with input from
   management, taking into account our most recent valuations from an
   independent third-party valuation specialist. Our board of directors
   intended all stock options granted to have an exercise price per share
   not less than the per share fair value of our common stock on the date
   of grant. The valuations of our common stock were determined in
   accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of
   Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of
   Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The
   assumptions we use in the valuation models were based on future
   expectations combined with management judgment, and considered numerous
   objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our
   common stock as of the date of each option grant, including the
   following factors:


     

   relevant precedent transactions involving our capital stock;


     

   contemporaneous valuations performed at periodic intervals by unrelated
   third-party specialists;


     

   the liquidation preferences, rights, preferences, and privileges of our
   redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to the common stock;


     

   our actual operating and financial performance;


     

   current business conditions and projections;


     

   our stage of development;


     

   the likelihood and timing of achieving a liquidity event for the shares
   of common stock underlying the stock options, such as an initial public
   offering, given prevailing market conditions;


     

   any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability of the
   common stock underlying the granted options;


     

   recent secondary stock sales and tender offers;


     

   the market performance of comparable publicly-traded companies; and


     

   the U.S. and global capital market conditions.

   In valuing our common stock at various dates in fiscal 2017, 2018, and
   2019, our board of directors determined the equity value of our
   business using various valuation methods including combinations of
   income and market approaches with input from management. The income
   approach estimates the fair value based on the expectation of future
   cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are
   discounted to their present values using an appropriate discount rate
   to reflect the risks inherent in us achieving these estimated cash
   flows. The market approach estimates value considering an analysis of
   guideline public companies. The guideline public companies method
   estimates value by applying a representative revenue multiple from a
   peer group of companies in similar lines of business to our forecasted
   revenue. Our peer group of companies was selected based on operational
   and economic similarities to us and factors considered included but
   were not limited to industry, business model, growth rates, customer
   base, capitalization, size, profitability and stage of development.
   From time to time, we updated the set of comparable companies as new or
   more relevant information became available. This approach involves the
   identification of relevant transactions, and determining relevant
   multiples to apply to our revenue.

   The equity values implied by the income and market approaches
   reasonably approximated each other as of each valuation date.


                                     87
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Once we determined an equity value, we used a combination of approaches
   to allocate the equity value to each class of our stock. We used the
   option pricing method, or OPM. The OPM allocates values to each equity
   class by creating a series of call options on our equity value, with
   exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences, participation
   rights, and exercise prices of the equity instruments.

   We also considered an appropriate discount adjustment to recognize the
   lack of marketability and liquidity due to the fact that stockholders
   of private companies do not have access to trading markets similar to
   those enjoyed by stockholders of public companies. The discount for
   marketability was determined using a protective put option model, in
   which a put option is used as a proxy for measuring discounts for lack
   of marketability of securities.

   Following August 2018, the resulting equity value was then allocated to
   the common stock using a probability weighted expected return method,
   or PWERM. Under PWERM, we estimated the value of our common stock based
   upon an analysis of our values assuming an initial public offering as a
   possible future event. Additionally, the OPM, using the preferred
   stockholders liquidation preferences, participation rights, dividend
   rights, and conversion rights to determine the value of each share
   class in specific potential future outcomes, was considered in the
   PWERM approach. We also applied a discount for lack of marketability to
   account for a lack of access to an active public market.

   In addition, we also considered any private or secondary transactions
   involving our capital stock as well as tender offers completed in
   fiscal 2017 and 2019. In our evaluation of those transactions, we
   considered the facts and circumstances of each transaction to determine
   the extent to which they represented a fair value exchange. Factors
   considered include transaction volume, timing, whether the transactions
   occurred among willing and unrelated parties, and whether the
   transactions involved investors with access to our financial
   information.

   Application of these approaches involves the use of estimates,
   judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such
   as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, and future
   cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of
   comparable companies, and the probability of possible future events.
   Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the
   relationships between those assumptions impact our valuations as of
   each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of
   our common stock.

   For valuations after the completion of this offering, our board of
   directors will determine the fair value of each share of underlying
   Class A common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as
   reported on the date of grant. Future expense amounts for any
   particular period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or
   market conditions.

   Based upon the assumed initial public offering price of $        per
   share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of
   this prospectus, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options
   outstanding as of June 30, 2019 was $        million, of which
   $        million related to vested stock options and $        million
   related to unvested stock options. In addition, we granted options to
   purchase 664,050 shares of our Class B common stock subsequent to
   June 30, 2019.

   Income Taxes

   We utilize the asset and liability method for computing our income tax
   provision. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the expected
   future consequences of temporary differences between the financial
   reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating
   loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax
   rates. Management makes estimates, assumptions, and judgments to
   determine our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and
   liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax
   assets. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be
   recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that
   recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.

   We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it
   is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on
   examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of
   the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then
   measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
   likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties
   related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been
   material, are recognized within provision for income taxes.

   Loss Contingencies

   We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax, and
   government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary
   course of business. Certain of these matters include claims for
   substantial or indeterminate amounts of


                                     88
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable
   that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably
   estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the
   loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the
   possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial
   statements. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible but the
   loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we state that
   such an estimate cannot be made.

   We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the
   amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the
   matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make
   adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures
   accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,
   rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant
   judgment is required to determine both the probability and the
   estimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based on our
   assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date
   and are subject to change based on new information and future events.

   The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or
   more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of
   managements expectations, our results of operations and financial
   condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such
   outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely
   affected.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements

   See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to
   our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
   prospectus for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently
   issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the dates of the
   statement of financial position included in this prospectus.

   Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

   In the course of preparing the financial statements that are included
   in this prospectus, our management has determined that we have material
   weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These
   material weaknesses primarily pertained to IT general controls,
   controls to address segregation of certain accounting duties, timely
   reconciliation and analysis of certain key accounts and the review of
   journal entries. We have concluded that these material weaknesses in
   our internal control over financial reporting occurred because, prior
   to this offering, we were a private company and did not have the
   necessary business processes, systems, personnel and related internal
   controls necessary to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting
   requirements of a public company.

   In order to remediate these material weaknesses, we have taken and plan
   to take the following actions:


     

   implementation of IT general controls to manage access and program
   changes within our IT environment;


     

   the hiring and continued hiring of additional accounting and finance
   resources with public company experience;


     

   implementation of additional review controls and processes and
   requiring timely account reconciliations and analyses; and


     

   implementation of processes and controls to better identify and manage
   segregation of duties risks.

   In accordance with the provisions of the JOBS Act, we and our
   independent registered public accounting firm were not required to, and
   did not, perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial
   reporting as of June 30, 2019 nor any period subsequent in accordance
   with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accordingly, we cannot
   assure you that we have identified all, or that we will not in the
   future have additional, material weaknesses. Material weaknesses may
   still exist when we report on the effectiveness of our internal control
   over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the
   Sarbanes-Oxley Act after the completion of this offering.

       LETTER FROM JOHN FOLEY, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

   Dear Prospective Investors and Peloton Members,

   At Peloton, we believe that better is in all of us.

   It is no secret that exercise makes us feel good. Its simple science:
   exercising creates endorphins and endorphins make us happy. On the most
   basic level, Peloton sells happiness. But of course, we do so much
   more. Our connected fitness experiences make it easy for our Members to
   get engaging, social, and highly effective workouts with world-class
   instructors anytime, anywhere. As a result, our Members work out 80%
   more than non-Peloton Members.^(1) And while the health benefits of
   regular physical fitness are well documented, the Peloton experience
   transcends health benefits alone. The happiness our Members experience
   enables each individual to be a better version of themselves, so they
   go on to inspire others. And that leads us to Pelotons mission: to
   better ourselves, inspire each other, and unite the world through
   fitness.

   I founded Peloton in 2012 to solve a challenge in my own life. My wife,
   Jill, and I knew great fitness experiences made us feel like better
   versions of ourselves, but there were countless barriers to working out
   regularly. We loved going to boutique studio fitness classes like
   cycling, running, boot camp, and yoga. We were addicted to the
   fast-paced energy, the motivational instructors, the thoughtful
   programming, and the way exercising with a group pushed us harder.
   These classes left us feeling energized, refreshed, stronger, and ready
   to take on anything. However, with demanding jobs and two small
   children at home, just getting to the gym became harder and harder.
   Classes with our favorite instructors sold out quickly and were
   prohibitively expensive. We also had to accommodate someone elses
   schedule at someone elses location. And we were often left without
   time, without options, and without the feeling of being our better
   selves that we sought.

   I figured that there must be a way to make these workouts more
   convenient, more affordable, and more accessible. There had to be a way
   to bring fantastic, high-energy, instructor-led group fitness into the
   home, to be experienced on my time, any time I wanted. And my hunch was
   that if I could make it possible, others would want it as well.

   With that spark of an idea, I looked for brilliant, creative,
   empathetic, high-integrity partners who shared my ambition and werent
   afraid to tackle complicated business and technology challenges. I was
   lucky to have several friends who fit the bill in spades: Hisao Kushi,
   Tom Cortese, Graham Stanton, and Yony Feng. All of my co-founders are
   still thriving at Peloton, each in a senior role and each an even
   stronger friend.

   To create Peloton, we needed to build what we believed to be the best
   indoor bike on the market, recruit the best instructors in the world,
   and engineer a state-of-the-art software platform to tie it all
   together. Against prevailing conventional wisdom, and despite countless
   investor conference rooms full of very smart skeptics, we were
   determined for Peloton to build a vertically integrated platform to
   deliver a seamless end-to-end experience as physically rewarding and
   addictive as attending a live, in-studio class. In Pelotons infancy,
   our lean founding team operated from a one-room headquarters with
   heavy black curtains that cordoned off a makeshift cycling studio,
   equipped with a modest six bikes and a used camcorder. We
   problem-solved our way from streaming live cycling classes to one
   hundred Members, then to one thousand, and now to over a million
   Members worldwide. It took a proverbial village to build Peloton, and
   that once-small village has grown into the community that is now the
   heart of our brand.

   From the very beginning, we have always put our Members first in
   everything we do, and they never cease to amaze us. Through connecting
   on the Peloton Bike, Tread, and Digital App, our Members have created
   one of the most supportive, optimistic, diverse, and inclusive
   communities in the world. Peloton Members are teachers, professional
   athletes, active military and veterans, healthcare providers,
   firefighters, policemen, famous actors and musicians, and even former
   Presidents. They are teenagers and senior citizens. From diverse life
   experiences, all gender identities and sexual orientations, countless
   nationalities and ethnicities. We are proud of our community of Members
   but even prouder of the way that they have united together in support
   of each other.

   Every day, I receive personal emails from our Members. The most
   consistent message I receive: Peloton has changed my life.
   Astonishingly, four out of five Members were not in the market for
   fitness equipment before they bought the Bike. They were in the market
   for improving their lives, just as Jill and I were back in 2012 when we
   started this company and began this journey.

   Seven years later, it is very clear to me that we have an immense
   opportunity in front of us at Peloton. Peloton is so much more than a
   Bike  we believe we have the opportunity to create one of the most
   innovative global technology platforms of our time. It is an
   opportunity to create one of the most important and influential
   interactive media companies in the world; a media company that changes
   lives, inspires greatness, and unites people. And it is an opportunity
   to create one of the best places to work in the cities where we operate
    we prioritize culture as much as any other business objective.

   And to be sure, we are not taking these opportunities lightly. William
   Lynch, our President; Jill Woodworth, our Chief Financial Officer;
   Kevin Cornils, our Managing Director of International; my co-founders;
   and our extended senior leadership team: all of us feel an immense
   responsibility to deliver on these opportunities, and we are ready. We
   have worked our entire careers for this very moment.

   Speaking for the entire Peloton team, we are incredibly grateful for
   all of our Members from all different backgrounds who love Peloton and
   have welcomed us into their lives over the past several years. We are
   truly humbled by your passion for our shared mission.

   Today, however, we look forward. At this important moment in our
   journey, I am honored to invite you to join Peloton.

   With gratitude,

   John Foley

   Founder and CEO

                                  BUSINESS

   Our Purpose

   We believe physical activity is fundamental to a healthy and happy
   life. Our ambition is to empower people to improve their lives through
   fitness.

   We are a technology company that meshes the physical and digital worlds
   to create a completely new, immersive, and connected fitness
   experience. We are also:

   a media company that creates engaging-to-the-point-of-addictive
   original programming with the best instructors in the world.

   an interactive software company that motivates our Members to achieve
   their goals.

   a product design company that develops beautiful and intuitive
   equipment that anticipates the needs of our Members.

   a social connection company that enables our community to support one
   another.

   a direct-to-consumer, multi-channel retail company that facilitates a
   seamless customer journey.

   an apparel company that allows Members to display their passion for
   Peloton.

   a logistics company that provides high-touch delivery, set up, and
   service for our Members.

   We are driven by our Members-first obsession and we will be any company
   we need to be in order to deliver the best fitness experience possible.

   Who We Are

   Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a
   loyal community of over 1.4 million Members. We pioneered connected,
   technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive,
   instructor-led boutique classes to our Members anytime, anywhere. We
   make fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient,
   while fostering social connections that encourage our Members to be the
   best versions of themselves.

   We are an innovation company at the nexus of fitness, technology, and
   media. We have disrupted the fitness industry by developing a
   first-of-its-kind subscription platform that seamlessly combines the
   best equipment, proprietary networked software, and world-class
   streaming digital fitness and wellness content, creating a product that
   our Members love. Our highly compelling offering helped our Members
   complete over 58 million Peloton workouts in fiscal 2019.

   Driven by our Members-first mindset, we built a vertically integrated
   platform that ensures a best-in-class, end-to-end experience. We have a
   direct-to-consumer multi-channel sales platform, including 74 showrooms
   with knowledgeable sales specialists, a high-touch delivery service,
   and helpful Member support teams. Our Members are as devoted to us as
   we are to them92% of our Connected Fitness Products ever sold still
   had an active Connected Fitness Subscription attached as of June 30,
   2019.

   Our Connected Fitness Product offerings currently include the Peloton
   Bike, launched in 2014, and the Peloton Tread, launched in 2018. Both
   our Bike and Tread include a state-of-the-art touchscreen that streams
   live and on-demand classes. Our products have a multitude of
   interactive software features that encourage frequent use, facilitate
   healthy competition on our patented leaderboard, build community among
   our Members, and inspire our Members to track performance and achieve
   their goals with real-time and historical metrics. As of June 30, 2019,
   we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products, with
   approximately 564,000 sold in the United States.

   Our world-class instructors teach classes across a variety of fitness
   and wellness disciplines, including indoor cycling, indoor/outdoor
   running and walking, bootcamp, yoga, strength training, stretching, and
   meditation. We produce over 950


                                     92
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   original programs per month and maintain a vast and constantly updated
   library of thousands of original fitness and wellness programs. We make
   it easy for Members to find a class that fits their interests based on
   class type, instructor, music genre, length, available equipment, area
   of physical focus, and level of difficulty.

   Our content is available on our Connected Fitness Products through a
   $39.00 monthly Connected Fitness Subscription, which allows for
   unlimited workouts across multiple users within a household. Our
   Connected Fitness Subscribers can enjoy our classes anywhere through
   Peloton Digital, which is available through iOS and Android mobile
   devices, as well as most tablets and computers. We also have Digital
   Subscribers who pay $19.49 per month for access our content library on
   their own devices.

   Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our Connected
   Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue. We have
   experienced significant growth in sales of Connected Fitness Products,
   which, when combined with our strong Connected Fitness Subscriber
   retention rates, has driven high growth in Connected Fitness
   Subscribers. Our Connected Fitness Subscriber base grew by 108% in
   fiscal 2019.

   Our compelling financial profile is characterized by high growth,
   strong retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient
   customer acquisition. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness
   Churn, together with our high Subscription Contribution Margin,
   generates attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. When
   we acquire new Connected Fitness Subscribers, we are able to offset our
   customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our
   Connected Fitness Products. This allows for rapid payback of our sales
   and marketing investments and results in a robust unit economic model.

   We are a fast-growing and scaled fitness platform. For fiscal 2017,
   2018, and 2019:


     

   we generated total revenue of $218.6 million, $435.0 million, and
   $915.0 million, respectively, representing 99.0% and 110.3%
   year-over-year growth;


     

   we incurred net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and
   $(195.6) million, respectively; and


     

   our Adjusted EBITDA was $(51.8) million, $(30.4) million, and $(71.3)
   million, respectively.

   See the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and
   Other DataNon-GAAP Financial Measures for information regarding our
   use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted
   EBITDA.

   For fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, key metrics of our business included:


     

   Connected Fitness Subscribers of 107,708, 245,667, and 511,202,
   respectively; and


     

   Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn of 0.70%, 0.64%, and 0.65%,
   respectively.

                           Historical Performance

   Our Industry and Opportunity

   Industry

   We participate in the massive and growing global health and wellness
   industry. According to a 2018 report by the Global Wellness Institute,
   the total global spend on the wellness industry in 2017 was $4.2
   trillion, of which the global spend on fitness and certain categories
   of wellness, including meditation and yoga, represented nearly
   $600 billion. According to the International Health, Racquet &
   Sportsclub Association, or IHRSA, 183 million and 62 million people had
   gym memberships globally and in the United States, respectively, as of
   2018.

   Our current product portfolio, which consists of our Bike, Tread, and
   fitness and wellness subscription services, addresses a large consumer
   base. Within our current and announced markets (the United States, the
   United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany), we estimate that 75 million
   people used treadmills and 27 million used stationary cycling bikes in
   the 12 months ended March 2019. In those same regions, we estimate that
   over 5 million treadmills and nearly 3 million stationary cycling bikes
   were purchased for in-home use in the 12 months ended March 2019. We
   believe that we are significantly expanding the market for fitness
   equipment and products. According to our 2019 Member Survey, four out
   of five Members were not in the market for home fitness equipment prior
   to purchasing a Peloton Connected Fitness Product.

   Opportunity

   We consider our market opportunity in terms of a Total Addressable
   Market, or TAM, which we believe is the market we can reach over the
   long-term in our current and announced markets, and a Serviceable
   Addressable Market, or SAM, which we address with our current product
   verticals and price points.

   According to our research, our TAM is 67 million households, of which
   45 million are in the United States. Within our TAM, we estimate that
   52 million households are interested in learning more about our
   Connected Fitness Products without seeing the price. We estimate that
   our SAM is 14 million Connected Fitness Products, with 12 million
   represented in the United States. Historically, our SAM has grown as
   our brand awareness has increased. With low brand awareness in our
   current international markets, we believe we will see SAM expand as we
   make further investments in building brand and product awareness in
   these regions. We will grow both TAM and SAM as we expand beyond our
   current geographies and grow SAM as we develop new Connected Fitness
   Products and content in new fitness verticals. With approximately
   577,000 Connected Fitness Products sold globally as of June 30, 2019,
   we are approximately 4% penetrated in our SAM of 14 million. For a
   discussion of the methodology used in determining our TAM and SAM, see
   the section titled Industry and Market Data.

   Consumer Trends in Our Favor

   Increasing Focus on Health and Wellness

   The growing awareness of the benefits of exercise and physical activity
   is driving increasing participation and spend in fitness and wellness.
   This has translated into consistent year-over-year growth of the
   fitness industry both in the United States and globally over the past
   two decades, even during times of economic recession. According to
   IHRSA, health club industry revenues in the United States grew at a
   5.4% annual growth rate over the last ten years. In addition, employers
   and health insurance companies are investing in employee well-being by
   offering incentives for preventative health measures such as exercise.
   According to a 2017 study by the National Business Group on Health, 74%
   of employers offer employee wellness incentives, with the average
   employee incentive amount increasing from $521 in 2013 to $742 in
   2017.    ^

   Streaming Media is the Leading Channel of Consumption

   The quality, volume, and speed of streaming content has profoundly
   changed media consumption patterns. Consumers can select from extensive
   catalogs of content across video programming, music, books, and gaming,
   among other categories, allowing for personalized, on-demand
   consumption anywhere, anytime, and at a great value. According to
   Kagan, a media research group of S&P Global Market Intelligence, global
   digital music paid subscribers are estimated to have grown from
   12.1 million in 2012 to 162.5 million in 2018. Similarly, digital video
   paid subscribers are estimated to have increased in the United States
   from 37.6 million in 2012 to 167.8 million in 2018.

   Desire for Community and Shared Experiences

   We believe consumers are increasingly spending on experiences and are
   seeking meaningful community connections. Within the fitness industry,
   consumers have migrated to boutique fitness due to personalization,
   expert instruction, and the sense of community. Boutique-style fitness
   offerings are the fastest growing brick-and-mortar fitness category.
   According to IHRSA, as of 2017, 40% of members of health and fitness
   clubs reported belonging to a boutique fitness studio, and from 2013 to
   2017, membership in boutique studios grew approximately 121%.

   Demand for Convenience

   Household trends, longer working hours, and the rise of mobile
   technology make it challenging to balance time between family, work,
   and personal health and wellness. According to the Pew Research Center,
   over the last few decades, there has been an increase in dual income
   families from 49% in 1970 to 66% in 2016. We believe that busy
   lifestyles, less free time, and changing household dynamics are driving
   demand for convenient fitness options.

   What Sets Us Apart

   Category-Defining Brand with Broad Appeal

   Peloton is the pioneer of connected, technology-enabled fitness. By
   meshing the physical and digital worlds, we have created an immersive
   experience that our Members love. We have scaled rapidly through
   data-driven marketing and


                                     95
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   education-based sales efforts. Our marketing is made more efficient by
   the significant word-of-mouth referrals from our loyal Members, which
   has become one of our largest sales channels. As a result of strong
   Connected Fitness Product sales and low Average Net Monthly Connected
   Fitness Churn, we have grown our Connected Fitness Subscribers from
   35,135 as of June 30, 2016 to 511,202 as of June 30, 2019, representing
   annualized growth of approximately 144.1%.

   We are democratizing access to high-quality boutique fitness by making
   it accessible and affordable through the compelling value of our
   unlimited household Connected Fitness Subscriptions and attractive
   financing programs for the Bike and Tread. We continue to broaden our
   demographic appealour fastest growing demographic segments are
   consumers under 35 years old and those with household incomes under
   $75,000.

   Growing and Scaled Platform with Network Effects

   As the largest interactive fitness platform in the world, our rapidly
   growing and scaled Member base is a highly strategic asset. With our
   first mover advantage, we have achieved critical mass, which improves
   our platform and Member experience. As of June 30, 2019, on average,
   nearly 6,400 Members participated in each cycling class, across live
   and on-demand. As our community of Members continues to grow, the
   Peloton fitness experience becomes more inspiring, more competitive,
   more immersive, and more connected. Over time, Members are embedded in
   the Peloton community and we become a part of their lives, increasing
   the opportunity cost of Members leaving or potential Members not
   joining our platform.

   Engaging-to-the-Point-of-Addictive Fitness Experience Drives High
   Retention

   By making fitness fun and motivating, we help our Members achieve their
   personal goals. We analyze millions of workouts per month to help us
   develop features that improve our Member experience and create new,
   on-trend fitness and wellness content that our Members crave.
   Engagement is the leading indicator of retention for our Connected
   Fitness Subscribers. We have consistently seen workouts increase over
   time. On average, our Connected Fitness Subscribers completed 7.5, 8.4,
   and 11.5 workouts per month in fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019,
   respectively. Usage drives value and loyalty, which is evidenced by our
   exceptional weighted-average 12-month Connected Fitness Subscriber
   retention rate of 95% across all fiscal year cohorts since fiscal 2016.

   Vertically Integrated Platform That is Difficult to Replicate

   We are driven by our Members-first obsession and see every Member
   touchpoint as an opportunity to exceed expectations. To create the best
   platform, we designed our own products, developed our own interactive
   software, and created our own high production value fitness and
   wellness programming. For full end-to-end Member support, we were also
   compelled to develop our own customer education, purchase and delivery,
   and services platform. We sell our Connected Fitness Products
   exclusively through our knowledgeable inside sales and showroom
   associates as well as our e-commerce site. Our high-touch delivery
   teams ensure that new Members are immediately set up and ready to work
   out on their new Bike or Tread. The effectiveness of our end-to-end
   platform is demonstrated by the high Net Promoter Score for our Bike,
   which has been within the range of 80 to 93 since we began measuring it
   in 2016.

   Compelling Financial Model

   Our financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong
   retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer
   acquisition. Our growth is attributable to our data-driven marketing
   approach and Member word-of-mouth referrals, both of which help us
   generate predictable and increasingly efficient Connected Fitness
   Product sales. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn,
   combined with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, results in
   attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. We offset
   customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our
   Connected Fitness Products, generating rapid payback of sales and
   marketing investments and robust unit economics.

   Founder-Led, Passionate Team

   Peloton was founded by John Foley in 2012. Along with his four
   co-founders, John set out to create the most convenient and immersive
   indoor cycling experience in the world. Our founders believed deeply
   that creating a Members-first experience would require Peloton to be as
   vertically integrated as possible, and so we built teams that span
   software development, product design, fitness instruction, content
   production, marketing, music, logistics, retail, and apparel. We
   believe that no other company is at the intersection of all these
   disciplines, which means that every day we are doing something that no
   other company has done before. This, along with the positive impact we
   have on our Members physical and mental well-being, fuels our passion
   for continuous innovation and progress.

   Growth Strategies

   Our goal is to rapidly grow our Member base through the sale of our
   Connected Fitness Products while continuing to engage and retain our
   scaled and loyal community of Members.

   Grow Brand Awareness

   We are still in the early stages of growth in our existing markets. As
   of June 30, 2019, we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness
   Products globally, a small fraction of the 14 million products we
   believe reflect our current SAM. While our aided brand awareness has
   grown rapidly in the United States and reached 67% as of April 3, 2019,
   we have significant room to increase our brand and product awareness in
   both the United States and in our other geographies through television,
   digital, and social media marketing, as well as our showrooms and
   word-of-mouth referrals. We continue to broaden our demographic appeal
   by educating customers on the compelling value of our Connected Fitness
   Subscriptions.

   Continuously Improve Member Experience

   We constantly improve and evolve our interactive software and content
   to drive Member engagement, which helps us maintain our high retention
   rates as we grow. We deploy new software features frequently and
   currently produce over 950 original programs per month to keep our
   content library fresh and on-trend. We also continue to drive usage
   through innovative fitness and wellness programs and goal-based
   challenges that make Members feel more accountable and help them reach
   their personal goals. Total Workouts for our Connected Fitness
   Subscribers grew from 17.9 million in fiscal 2018 to 52.2 million in
   fiscal 2019, respectively, representing a 192% increase. For a
   definition of Total Workouts, see the section titled Managements
   Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
   OperationsKey Operational and Business Metrics.

   Launch New Products and Expand Content Offering

   Over time, we plan to invest heavily in new product development and
   content to further penetrate our SAM. We will launch new Connected
   Fitness Products and accessories in our existing, as well as new
   fitness verticals, while continuously updating and expanding our
   original fitness and wellness programming. We will pursue new products
   where there is a large market opportunity in areas of fitness with
   staying power.

   Pursue Disciplined Expansion into New Geographies

   With more than 174 million people belonging to gyms globally, we
   believe there is significant opportunity for Peloton to grow
   internationally. In 2018, we began our international expansion and
   brought the Peloton experience to the United Kingdom and Canada. With
   our expansion into Germany in the winter of 2019, we will be in the
   largest fitness markets in the world. We will continue to pursue
   disciplined international expansion by targeting countries with high
   fitness penetration and spend, the presence of boutique fitness, and
   where we believe the Peloton value proposition will resonate.

   Invest in Our Platform

   We will continue to invest in technology and infrastructure to extend
   our leadership in connected fitness, increase our value proposition,
   and support our growth. Over the next couple of years, we will continue
   to invest in state-of-the-art production studios in New York City and
   London and a new headquarters in New York City, which will include a
   dedicated research and development facility for new product design,
   development, and testing. We will continue to invest heavily in a
   variety of software and hardware engineering functions, supply chain
   operations, manufacturing, and advanced quality assurance to support
   our growth.

   Increase Profitability Through Fixed Cost Leverage

   The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base will
   allow us to improve Subscription Contribution Margin, increase
   Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, and generate operating
   leverage. A significant portion of our content creation costs can be
   leveraged over time given that a limited number of production studios
   and instructors can support the future growth of our Subscriber base.
   We expect to drive continued efficiencies in sales and marketing
   expenses as we benefit from increasing brand awareness, word-of-mouth
   referrals from our growing Subscriber base, and further optimization of
   our sales and marketing investments by channel. We will also achieve
   operating leverage as we scale fixed general and administrative
   expenses, including those associated with our new headquarters in New
   York City.

   The Tread provides a one-of-a-kind experience for runners, strength
   trainers, and bootcamp enthusiasts. Like our Bike, the Tread has a
   state-of-the-art touch screen that allows Members to stream live and
   on-demand classes and is designed for performance and comfort. The
   Tread features a shock-absorbing rubber-slat belt and ball bearing
   system, ideal for low-impact training, while pace and incline knobs
   allow for seamless adjustments. The 32 high-definition touchscreen
   features a 20-watt sound bar for an immersive experience both on and
   off the Tread. Currently our Tread is only available in the United
   States and sells for $4,295, which includes delivery and set up. We
   offer qualified customers a 24-month, 0% APR financing program,
   allowing them to purchase the Tread and pay in monthly installments of
   $179.00.

   Connected Fitness Subscriptions

   Our Connected Fitness Subscriptions are on a month-to-month basis,
   allow for multiple household users, and provide unlimited access to all
   live and on-demand classes. Our Connected Fitness Subscription allows
   Members to access classes through our Connected Fitness Products,
   compete on our motivating leaderboard, track performance metrics, and
   connect and interact with the broader Peloton community. Our Connected
   Fitness Subscription also includes access to our content through
   Peloton Digital which is available through iOS and Android mobile
   devices and most tablets and computers. Our Connected Fitness
   Subscriptions allow up to five Members of a household to access our
   content simultaneously. On average, we had 2.0 Members per Connected
   Fitness Subscription as of June 30, 2019.

   Peloton Digital

   Peloton Digital began as a companion app for Connected Fitness
   Subscribers to provide access to our classes while our Members were
   away from their Connected Fitness Products. Starting in June 2015, we
   offered Peloton Digital as a standalone fitness app. In June 2018, we
   relaunched Peloton Digital when we expanded our content offering to
   include bootcamp and indoor/outdoor running and walking classes. As of
   June 30, 2019, we had approximately 102,000 Peloton Digital
   Subscribers, in addition to our over 511,202 Connected Fitness
   Subscribers. A Digital Subscriber is an individual or household that
   has a paid Peloton subscription with a successful credit card billing.
   With over 67 million households in our current and announced markets
   open to subscription fitness, we believe there is ample opportunity for
   us to grow our Digital Subscription base over time.

   Today, Peloton Digital is included with all Connected Fitness
   Subscriptions. As of June 30, 2019, 50% of our Connected Fitness
   Subscribers used Peloton Digital to supplement their workout regime.
   Peloton Digital also helps us attract new Connected Fitness Subscribers
   by serving as an acquisition tool for new Members.

   Since the Peloton Digital relaunch in June 2018, we have added several
   new fitness verticals which we believe have increased the value of our
   subscription services. These include indoor/outdoor running and
   walking, bootcamp, strength training, stretching, and meditation. We
   have also significantly expanded our yoga offerings. Our Members have
   shown strong interest in these new verticals; in fiscal 2019, 35% of
   workouts completed were not indoor cycling classes.

   Our Compelling Value Proposition

   Our monthly Connected Fitness Subscription at $39.00 is less expensive
   than most monthly gym memberships, a fraction of the price of a
   personal training session, and approximately the same price as one
   boutique fitness class for one person. Boutique studio fitness classes
   typically cost between $25.00 and $45.00 per class, per person and
   follow a rigid schedule whereas our monthly Connected Fitness
   Subscription covers the household and offers unlimited use, anytime,
   anywhere. Our live class schedule and on-demand library feature classes
   spanning five to 90 minutes, providing Members with flexibility and
   convenience.

   To increase affordability, we offer attractive 0% APR financing
   programs for our Connected Fitness Products. These programs allow our
   qualified customers to pay in monthly installments of as low as $58.00
   for 39 months and $179.00 for 24 months for our Bike and Tread,
   respectively. Our financing programs have successfully broadened our
   base of Members by attracting consumers from a wider spectrum of ages
   and income levels. In fiscal 2019, approximately 50% of all Connected
   Fitness Products sold were financed.

   Existing Connected Fitness Subscribers provide a clear endorsement of
   the superior value of our offering. According to our 2019 Member
   Survey, the vast majority of our Members say that Peloton offers a
   better value than all other fitness alternatives. We strive to
   continuously improve our Member experience and value proposition
   through enhancements to our content and interactive software features.

   Our Vertically Integrated Fitness Platform

   Technology

   Our content delivery and interactive software platform are critical to
   our Member experience. We invest substantial resources in research and
   development to enhance our platform, develop new products and features,
   and improve our


                                     100

   platform infrastructure. Our research and development organization
   consists of world-class engineering, product, and design teams. Our
   teams have a diverse set of skills and industry experience, including
   expertise in highly scalable distributed systems, machine learning,
   artificial intelligence, and user-centric application engineering. Our
   engineering, product, and design teams work together to bring our
   products to life, from conception and validation to implementation. We
   constantly improve our existing Connected Fitness Products through
   frequent software updates with new and innovative interactive features.
   We are committed to leveraging data to continuously improve our Member
   experience by studying and understanding points of interaction and how
   our Members use our software features.

   Video streaming and storage are provided by third-party cloud
   providers. By leveraging these third parties, we are able to focus our
   resources on creating product enhancements and new software features.
   In addition, our technology platform is designed with redundancy and
   high availability in mind in order to minimize Member service
   disruption.

   Content and Music

   We create engaging-to-the-point-of-addictive original fitness and
   wellness content in an authentic live environment that is immersive,
   motivating, and encourages a sense of community. We combine high
   production value content with a broad catalogue of music to create a
   truly unique fitness experience our Members love.

   Content Development

   We use performance data to understand our Members workout habits in
   order to evolve and optimize our programming around class type, length,
   music, and other considerations. We have developed a diverse content
   library with thousands of classes across an extensive range of class
   lengths, difficulty levels, and fitness preferences ranging from fun
   and flexible to structured and highly technical, all of which our
   Members easily access through filtering and search capabilities. We
   produce over 950 original programs per month from three production
   studios in New York City and London, with 29 instructors as of June 30,
   2019, and across 10 fitness and wellness disciplines including indoor
   cycling, indoor/outdoor running and walking, bootcamp, yoga, strength
   training, stretching, meditation, and floor cardio. We entered into a
   long-term lease agreement at 5 Manhattan West in New York City in
   October 2018, which will serve as our fitness programming hub in North
   America and will feature four state-of-the-art production studios. We
   anticipate that this facility will open in Spring 2020.

   As we further expand internationally, we will develop localized
   content, as we have done in the United Kingdom where we produce content
   featuring three local instructors as of June 30, 2019. In December
   2018, we entered into a long-term lease agreement at 11 Floral Street
   in London, England, which will serve as our fitness programming hub in
   Europe with three state-of-the-art production studios. As we expand
   into Germany and other non-English-speaking countries, we will produce
   classes in local languages from this location and use subtitling for
   our English-speaking programming. We may selectively open small, local
   studios to supplement our international programming.

   Instructors

   In front of the camera, our 29 celebrated instructors play a critical
   role in bringing the Peloton experience to life for our Members. Our
   instructors are not only authorities in their respective areas of
   fitness, but also relatable, magnetic personalities who inspire
   passionate followings. We offer a diverse cast of instructors that
   allows us to appeal to a broad audience of Members. Our instructors
   inspire our Members both on and off the camera and attend showroom
   openings and other Member-focused events where they meet and interact
   with our Members. Our Members feel connected to our instructors, and
   many Members travel from far distances to take a class at our New York
   City studios.

   Production Team

   Behind the camera, our studio production teams are dedicated to
   creative excellence. We have top production talent representing decades
   of experience at major broadcast and cable networks, some of whom have
   won Emmy Awards for production excellence. Our teams provide dedicated
   creative support to our instructors before, during, and after live
   productions with the help of content performance data. We are focused
   on efficiency while maintaining high-quality production. All classes
   are shot in broadcast quality environments with a fraction of the staff
   and budget typical of a major network show. This allows us to deliver a
   constant stream of live-produced, authentic fitness and wellness
   programming with cinematic quality that provides clarity of instruction
   and entertainment value.



                                    LOGO

   Music and Music Technology

   We have developed a proprietary music platform that fuels the workout
   experience with thoughtfully curated playlists that align with our
   Members musical preferences. We have over a million songs under
   license, representing the largest audiovisual connected fitness music
   catalog in the world. Our curated music is as diverse and dynamic as
   the Members we serve, delivering a custom-fit-and-finish musical
   experience created by instructors and music supervisors on our
   production team.

   We control the intersection of fitness and music in a deeply engaging
   way, motivating Members to achieve their fitness goals while
   discovering great music in the process. Peloton is a discovery resource
   for new artists and songs while also providing the opportunity for our
   Members to re-discover music they love. Members consistently rank the
   music we provide as one of their favorite aspects of the Peloton
   experience. We believe we have defined a new standard for musical
   content development in the fitness and wellness categories, which
   includes premiering new music, working with artists to co-curate
   classes based on their own music or influences, and partnering to
   create new music.

   We have applied, and will continue to apply, technological solutions to
   enhance our music platform including:


     

   data-driven playlist recommendations for our instructors and music
   supervisors to use in developing class plans;


     

   instructor-facing song search and filtering functions, including the
   ability to search by song length and BPM;


     

   real-time music and content management and reporting;


     

   for Members, a display of every song played in a class, including
   artist name and associated artwork;


     

   ability for Members to like songs they discover anywhere on our
   platform and save it to their profile; and


     

   integrations with Spotify and Apple Music, enabling Members to sync
   songs they hear on Peloton to their streaming service.

   Music Rights Strategy

   We have built a world class music content management and reporting
   system to meet the needs of our music rights holders in order to
   support our highly-engaged, growing global community of over 1.4
   million Members. Peloton is increasingly seen by our partners as an
   impactful music discovery platform, which has created opportunities to
   progressively and meaningfully enhance our classes with custom music
   experiences. We expect this to continue as we invest in music-first
   technology to improve the quality of our Members experience,
   strengthen our competitive advantage over other fitness platforms, and
   add value to our Members.

   Sales and Marketing

   Our goal is to increase brand awareness and purchase intent for our
   Connected Fitness Products and subscriptions. We use a unique
   combination of brand and product-specific performance marketing to
   build brand awareness and generate predictable sales of our Connected
   Fitness Products. In just a few years, Pelotons aided brand awareness
   has grown significantly, and as of April 3, 2019, our aided brand
   awareness in the United States was 67%. Our marketing strategies have
   focused on product education and broadening our demographic reach. Our
   fastest growing demographic segments included Members under the age of
   35 and Members making under $75,000 in annual household income.

   Video has been the strongest medium to communicate the features of the
   Peloton platform. We primarily market through advertisements on
   broadcast and cable television, social media, and over-the-top
   providers such as Hulu and YouTube to reach our target audience,
   focusing on incremental return on investment. Our direct-to-consumer
   model allows us to conduct frequent tests in our sales channels,
   including testing our brand creative and messages, allowing us to
   further optimize marketing spend. We also frequently test alternative
   marketing channels, such as podcasts and other forms of audio
   advertising, as well as direct mailing.


                                    LOGO

   Direct to Consumer, Multi-Channel Sales Model

   We sell our products directly to customers through a multi-channel
   sales platform that includes e-commerce, inside sales, and showrooms.
   Our sales associates use robust customer relationship management tools
   to deliver an elevated, personalized, and educational purchase
   experience, regardless of channel of capture and conversion.
   Integration and coordination across all sales channels is critical to
   the customer journey, evidenced by over 37% of our customers purchasing
   a product or service in a different channel than where they originally
   engaged with Peloton in fiscal 2019.


     

   E-Commerce and Inside Sales: Our desktop and mobile websites,
   www.onepeloton.com, www.onepeloton.co.uk, and www.onepeloton.ca,
   provide an elevated brand experience where visitors can learn about our
   products and services and access product reviews. Our inside sales team
   engages with customers by phone, email, and online chat on our
   websites, and offers one-on-one sales consultations seven days a week.

   Showrooms: Our showrooms allow customers to experience and try our
   products. We provide interactive product demonstrations and many of our
   showrooms have private areas where customers can do a test ride or
   test run. We frequently host Peloton community events in our
   showrooms, which help deepen brand engagement and loyalty.


     

   Commercial: The commercial and hospitality markets represent a small
   percentage of sales but are important to driving trial and brand
   awareness. Our Bikes in hospitality locations help keep our Members
   riding when they travel, creating further Member engagement, loyalty,
   and convenience. Across our markets as of June 30, 2019, there were
   1,298 Peloton Bikes in 696 hotels and resorts.

   Showroom Site Strategy

   As of June 30, 2019, we operated 74 showrooms across the United States,
   Canada and the United Kingdom. Our showrooms are located primarily in
   upscale malls, lifestyle centers, and premium street locations. When
   evaluating potential new markets, we carefully examine historical sales
   data, key demographics, traffic patterns, geographic locations, and
   co-tenancy of other complementary lifestyle-oriented retailers. In the
   United States, we attempt to cluster stores around major urban markets
   and suburbs while also operating in super regional and regional centers
   that draw from a greater trade area. In Canada and the United Kingdom,
   we will continue to focus on major urban markets. We target locations
   where we expect payback of one year or less and positive contributions
   to EBITDA within the first year of operation.

   We operate two showroom formats including our large showrooms which
   range from 1,500 to 2,000 square feet and microstores which are
   typically around 300 square feet. Large showrooms comprise 70% of our
   retail locations and provide space for Connected Fitness Products and
   Peloton-branded apparel, as well as private areas for test rides and
   test runs. Microstores represent 30% of our retail locations and are
   typically placed in highly visible center court areas. Our showroom
   leases are typically five to ten years in lease duration while
   microstores are typically open for up to 1.5 years. Microstores allow
   us to test markets and specific shopping areas, and provide a temporary
   location while searching for the ideal large showroom space.

   Retention Marketing & Member Support Services

   The retention marketing team is focused on driving engagement to help
   us maintain our high Connected Fitness Subscriber retention rates. The
   team develops new ways to promote engagement with our products and
   community or help Members reengage with our platform when activity has
   lapsed. The retention team helps curate goal-based challenges, awards
   digital badges for Member accomplishments, and sends Peloton-branded
   Century Club shirts after a Members 100^th class. The team also
   communicates with Members with no recent activity through email
   campaigns that help encourage these Members to get back to their
   workout routine. The retention marketing team also collects and
   responds to feedback about our platform that is on our closed Facebook
   group of over 180,000 Members as of June 30, 2019.

   In order to bring our community together, we organize several in-person
   events throughout the year including welcoming Members for workouts,
   milestone celebrations, and instructor meet-and-greets at our
   production studios in New York City. We also host Members at our
   showrooms, and celebrate our Members with our flagship Member event,
   Peloton Homecoming, held in New York City each May. At Peloton
   Homecoming 2019, we welcomed nearly 3,000 individuals to New York City
   to participate in three days of events including scheduled talks, a
   community celebration, and fitness classes.

   The Member support team was created to serve all the needs of our
   customers and Members including sales support, scheduling, delivery,
   installation, account and billing inquiries, Connected Fitness Product
   trouble-shooting and repair, product education, returns and exchanges,
   and anything else our Members need. This team primarily operates in New
   York City and Plano, Texas. We also utilize some additional third-party
   support services in Ireland and North America to help us efficiently
   scale our team.

   Manufacturing

   We outsource the manufacturing of our products to multiple contract
   manufacturers located in Asia. The components used in our products are
   sourced either directly by us or on our behalf by our contract
   manufacturers from a variety of component suppliers. To continue to
   provide our Members with leading fitness technology, our supply chain
   team coordinates the relationships between our contract manufacturers
   and component suppliers. We regularly review our existing contract
   manufacturers and component suppliers, and evaluate new partners and
   suppliers, to ensure that we can scale our manufacturing base as we
   grow.

   We purchase from our primary contract manufacturers on a purchase order
   basis. Under our governing agreements, our contract manufacturers must
   follow our established product design specifications, quality assurance
   programs, and manufacturing standards. We have developed preferred
   relationships with our partners to maintain access to the resources
   needed to scale seasonally and ensure our partners have the requisite
   experience to produce our Connected Fitness Products and accessories.
   We pay for and own certain tooling and equipment specifically required
   to manufacture our products to have control of supply and component
   pipelines. We have purchase commitments based on our purchase orders
   for certain amounts of goods, work-in-progress, and components.

   In order to mitigate against the risks related to a single source of
   supply, we qualify alternative suppliers and manufacturers when
   possible, and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions,
   including maintaining adequate inventory of any single source
   components and products. To date, we have not experienced material
   delays in obtaining any of our components or products.

   At each of our manufacturers facilities, we have a quality team that
   is involved throughout the entire development process. To ensure
   consistent quality, we routinely perform product audits on non-core
   suppliers and staff full-time supplier quality engineers at core
   product manufacturing sites.

   Logistics and Fulfillment

   To control every touchpoint of our product and service offering, we
   have built networks of last mile field operations centers, which have
   further expanded from the United States into Canada and the United
   Kingdom. With 24 locations in major markets of North America and two
   locations in the United Kingdom as of June 30, 2019, our field
   operations team supports in-home delivery of our Connected Fitness
   Products with professional high-touch set up service and ongoing
   in-home service and care. As highly trained experts on our products and
   services, our field specialists offer product education, assistance
   with account set up, and tips and recommendations for product care and
   content selection. As we grow our logistics network, we are able to
   efficiently service, deploy, and install replacement parts to our
   Members over time.

   With our commitment to our Members-first approach, we will continue to
   invest to strengthen our field operations coverage in locations we
   identify as cost-effective delivery markets throughout North America
   and in new international regions. To further scale our distribution
   system and maintain flexibility, we also work with third-party
   fulfillment partners that deliver our products from multiple locations
   in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Third-party
   fulfillment partnerships allow us to reduce order fulfillment time,
   reduce shipping costs, and expand our geographical reach. Our field
   operations performed 58% of Connected Fitness Product deliveries during
   fiscal 2019.

   Intellectual Property

   The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an
   important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of
   patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality
   procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to
   establish and protect our intellectual property. We generally enter
   into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product
   assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control
   access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.

   As of June 30, 2019, we held six issued U.S. patents and had 22 U.S.
   patent applications pending. We also held 13 patent applications
   pending in foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. issued patents expire
   between May 20, 2025 and July 16, 2034. As of

Table of Contents

   June 30, 2019, we held 10 registered trademarks in the United States,
   including the Peloton mark and our P logo and also held 63 registered
   trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our
   development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new
   intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent
   applications with respect to our technology.

   Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only
   limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be
   challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated.
   Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary
   rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and,
   therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our
   proprietary technology.

   Government Regulation

   We are subject to many varying laws and regulations in the United
   States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and throughout the
   world, including those related to privacy, data protection, content
   regulation, intellectual property, consumer protection, e-commerce,
   marketing, advertising, messaging, rights of publicity, health and
   safety, employment and labor, product liability, accessibility,
   competition, and taxation. These laws often require companies to
   implement specific information security controls to protect certain
   types of information, such as personal data, special categories of
   personal data or health data. These laws and regulations are
   constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or
   amended in a manner that could harm our current or future business and
   operations. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may
   seek to block or limit our products and services or otherwise impose
   other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of
   any or all of our products and services for an extended period of time
   or indefinitely.

   In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the
   GDPR, became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is intended to create
   a single legal framework that applies across all EU member states.
   However, there are certain areas where EU member states can deviate
   from the requirements in their own legislation. It is therefore likely
   that we will need to comply with these local regulations in addition to
   the GDPR. Local supervisory authorities are able to impose fines for
   non-compliance and have the power to carry out audits, require
   companies to cease or change processing, request information, and
   obtain access to premises. The GDPR created more stringent operational
   requirements for processors and controllers of personal data,
   including, for example, requiring enhanced disclosures to data subjects
   about how personal data is processed (including information about the
   profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making),
   limiting retention periods of personal data, requiring mandatory data
   breach notification, and requiring additional policies and procedures
   to comply with the accountability principle under the GDPR. In
   addition, data subjects have more robust rights with regard to their
   personal data. Similarly, other jurisdictions are instituting privacy
   and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which could increase
   our risk and compliance costs.

   Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding
   cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to the
   transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area, or EEA,
   and the United Kingdom (after Brexit). We rely on transfer mechanisms
   permitted under these laws, including the standard contract clauses,

   Competition

   We believe that our first-mover advantage, leading market position,
   brand recognition, and vertically integrated platform set us apart in
   the rapidly growing market for connected, technology-enabled fitness.
   We provide a superior value proposition and benefit from the clear
   endorsement of our Connected Fitness Subscribers, giving us a
   competitive advantage versus traditional fitness and wellness products
   and services, and future potential entrants.

   While we believe we are changing the consumption patterns for fitness
   and growing the market, the main sources of competition include
   in-studio fitness classes, fitness clubs, at-home fitness equipment and
   content, and health and wellness apps.

   The areas in which we compete include:


     

   Consumers and Engagement. We compete for consumers to join our platform
   through Connected Fitness or Digital Subscriptions, and we seek to
   retain them through engagement and community.

     

   Product Offering. We compete with producers of fitness products and
   work to ensure that our Connected Fitness Products maintain the most
   innovative technology and user-friendly features.


     

   Talent. We compete for talent in every vertical across our company
   including technology, media, fitness, design, logistics, music,
   marketing, finance, legal, and retail. As our platform is highly
   dependent on technology and software, we require a significant base of
   engineers to continue innovating.

   The principal competitive factors that companies in our industry need
   to consider include, but are not limited to: total cost, manufacturing
   efficiency, enhanced products and services, original content, product
   quality and safety, competitive pricing policies, vision for the market
   and product innovation, strength of sales and marketing strategies,
   technological advances, and brand awareness and reputation. We believe
   we compete favorably across all of these factors and we have developed
   a business model that is difficult to replicate.

   Culture and People


   LOGO   The main group of riders in a race.

   Riders in a peloton work together, conserve energy and perform better
   because of one another.

   Mission and Values

   Like our brand, product, and content offerings, our culture is dynamic,
   unique, and framed by our expansive vision and passion for community
   and collaboration. For our people, the purpose and function of our
   culture is clear, and operates as a shared language of values and as a
   way of getting things done that permeates through the many areas in
   which we operate as a company. Our culture is shaped by our four
   primary values, described below:


     

   Put Members First: We obsess over every touchpoint of our Member
   experience. We have a Member-centered mindset that prioritizes a
   positive product and brand experience. We are proud to be pioneers and
   innovators of a global, product-oriented, fitness-centered community.


     

   Operate with a Bias for Action: We value innovation, continuous
   improvement, and challenging the status quo, all of which are keys to
   success in a competitive environment. We move quickly, take smart
   risks, fail fast and learn from failures. We never let the fear of
   imperfection stop us from achieving great things.


     

   Empower Teams of Smart Creatives: We hire individuals who are great at
   what they do, and encourage all of our team members to think openly and
   creatively to solve tough, exciting problems. We empower our team
   members to think and act like owners.


     

   Together We Go Far: As our company name suggests, we know the
   importance and value of a team. We know our collective differences make
   us stronger, and uphold the obligation to dissent and listen. We value
   inclusivity and we are proud that everyone can work to help solve
   difficult problems and have an impact.

   To foster these values, we have committed to promote our One Peloton
   culture:


     

   Best Place to Work: We offer generous benefits and compensation
   packages, including equity to all full-time employees, parental leave,
   health and wellness offerings, family planning assistance, and learning
   and development opportunities.


     

   Commitment to Equal Pay: We conduct an annual third-party audit of team
   members pay to confirm that our pay-for-performance philosophy
   transcends race and gender. If an audit reveals any pay differences
   unexplained by legitimate business factors between team members who
   hold similar jobs, but are of different races or genders, we adjust the
   affected team members respective compensation accordingly.


     

   Social Impact: Our Comeback Initiative recognizes Members and
   non-Members nominated by themselves or others through sharing stories
   about their respective journeys back from a difficult time. Committees
   consisting of Peloton team members determine the individuals to
   recognize and, in turn, develop deeper connections to our community.
   Recognized individuals receive a Peloton Bike and three-year Connected
   Fitness Subscription. We believe this award offers motivation and
   encouragement to support those on their comeback journeys, while
   engaging and activating our community.

   Employees

   We are extremely proud of our team which embodies a diverse mix of
   backgrounds, industries, and levels of experience. As of June 30, 2019,
   we employed approximately 1,800 individuals in the United States across
   our New York City headquarters,


                                     108
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   Plano campus, Atlanta office, showrooms, and 23 field operations
   warehouses. Internationally, we had 94 employees in the United Kingdom
   and Germany across corporate, showroom, and warehouse functions, 34
   employees in Canada largely in showroom and warehouse roles, and 26
   individuals in Taiwan across quality engineering and operations
   functions. Certain of our instructors are covered by collective
   bargaining agreements with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation
   of Television and Radio Artists, or SAG-AFTRA. However, we are not
   signatories to any agreements with SAG-AFTRA. With the exception of
   SAG-AFTRA, none of our domestic employees are currently represented by
   a labor organization or a party to any collective bargaining. We also
   hire additional seasonal employees in our field operations, member
   support, and showrooms during the holiday season.

   Facilities

   Our corporate headquarters are located in New York City, where we
   occupy facilities totaling approximately 65,000 rentable square feet
   under a lease that expires in 2027. We use these facilities primarily
   for technology, product design, research and development, sales and
   marketing, supply chain and logistics, finance, legal, human resources,
   and information technology. In November 2018, we entered into a lease
   agreement for our planned new corporate headquarters in New York City,
   which we intend to occupy by the fall of 2020 and which consists of
   approximately 312,000 square feet under a 16-year lease. We also have a
   Member support and sales team located in Plano, Texas, where we occupy
   approximately 28,000 rentable square feet under a lease that expires in
   2023.

   In addition to our corporate headquarters and regional campus, we
   currently operate two small programming hubs in New York City where we
   produce our content and offer fitness classes. In December 2017, we
   entered into a twenty-year lease for approximately 36,000 rentable
   square feet in New York City, which will include four production
   studios and adjacent office space. In September 2018, we entered into a
   lease for 11 Floral Street in London, which will serve as our content
   production hub for Europe and has 31,150 rentable square feet. We
   expect to open this London location in Fall 2020. We currently operate
   a temporary production studio in London where we produce local indoor
   cycling content. We also lease office space and showrooms for our
   products in 74 locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and
   Canada as of June 30, 2019.

   We intend to procure additional space as we add employees and expand
   geographically. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our
   needs for the immediate future and that suitable additional space will
   be available to accommodate any expansion of our operations as needed.

   Legal Proceedings

   VR Optics

   On August 11, 2016, VR Optics, LLC, or VR Optics, filed a lawsuit
   against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
   York, alleging that we are infringing U.S. Patent No. 6,902,513 titled
   Interactive fitness equipment, or the 513 patent. On November 7,
   2016, we filed counterclaims against VR Optics for declaratory judgment
   of non-infringement and invalidity and intentional interference with
   our contractual relationship with Villency Design Group, LLC, or VDG, a
   product design company we hired in 2012 to help design the Peloton
   Bike. We also filed an amended third-party complaint against VDG for
   breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and
   Eric Villency and Joseph Coffey, the owners of VR Optics and VDG, for
   intentional interference with our contractual relationship with VDG.
   Among other things, we seek to enforce VDGs contractual obligation to
   defend and indemnify us for intellectual property claims, including the
   patent claim asserted by VR Optics.

   On December 9, 2016, VR Optics and VDG moved to dismiss all our
   non-patent counterclaims. In response, we amended our counterclaims to
   add a new claim against VDG for its fraudulent concealment of a
   potential patent infringement claim against us when Mr. Villency and
   Mr. Coffey first sought to acquire the 513 patent, which was prior to
   the expiration of our contract with VDG. On January 20, 2017, VR
   Optics, VDG, Mr. Villency, and Mr. Coffey filed a motion to dismiss the
   third-party complaint and one of our non-patent counterclaims against
   VR Optics. The motion to dismiss was denied on August 18, 2017. Fact
   discovery concluded on February 1, 2019. Expert discovery is complete.
   Summary judgment motions were filed by both parties in early July 2019
   and decisions on them are pending. There is currently no trial date
   set.

   We intend to defend the claims made against us and to prosecute the
   counterclaims presented. Litigation, however, is inherently uncertain,
   and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against us or settlement
   could materially and adversely impact our business, financial
   condition, operating results, and prospects. In addition, litigation
   can involve significant management time and attention, and the cost of
   litigation can be expensive, regardless of outcome.

   Downtown Music Publishing

   On March 19, 2019, Downtown Music Publishing LLC, ole Media Management,
   L.P., Big Deal Music, LLC, CYPMP, LLC, Peer International Corporation,
   PSO Limited, Peermusic Ltd., Peermusic III, Ltd., Peertunes, Ltd.,
   Songs of Peer Ltd., Reservoir Media Management, Inc., The Richmond
   Organization, Inc., Round Hill Music LLC, The Royalty Network, Inc.,
   and Ultra International Music Publishing, LLC filed a lawsuit against
   us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,
   captioned Downtown Music Publg LLC, et. al v. Peloton Interactive,
   Inc., alleging that we engaged in copyright infringement by using
   certain accused songs in classes without necessary licenses. The
   plaintiffs allege that they are music publishers that own or control
   the copyrights in numerous musical works that were synchronized by us
   without the plaintiffs authorization. The complaint asserts a single
   claim for copyright infringement. It seeks injunctive relief, more than
   $150 million in damages, and attorneys fees and costs.

   The plaintiffs served us with the summons and complaint on March 21,
   2019. On April 30, 2019, we answered the complaint and filed
   counterclaims against the original named plaintiffs and National Music
   Publishers Association, Inc., a trade association, alleging that they
   coordinated to collectively negotiate licenses in violation of the
   antitrust laws. Our counterclaims also assert that the trade
   association tortiously interfered with Pelotons attempts to engage in
   direct negotiations with music publishers in violation of state law.
   The counterclaims seek injunctive relief, monetary damages (to be
   trebled under applicable statute), and attorneys fees and costs. An
   amended complaint filed on May 31, 2019 named additional plaintiffs
   Greensleeves Publishing Ltd., Me Gusta Music, LLC, Raleigh Music
   Publishing LLC, STB Music, Inc., and TuneCore, Inc. and identified
   additional musical works. We answered the amended complaint on June 14,
   2019. On June 24, 2019, counter-defendants filed a motion to dismiss
   the counterclaims, to which we filed an opposition on August 8, 2019.
   Discovery on the claims and counterclaims is ongoing in the case.

   We intend to defend the claims made against us and to prosecute the
   counterclaims presented. Litigation, however, is inherently uncertain,
   and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against us or settlement
   could materially and adversely impact our business, financial
   condition, operating results, and prospects. In addition, litigation
   can involve significant management time and attention, and the cost of
   litigation can be expensive, regardless of outcome.

   Other

   We are and, from time to time, we may become involved in legal
   proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of
   our business. We are not presently a party to any other legal
   proceedings that in the opinion of our management, if determined
   adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material
   adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition,
   or cash flows.

   executive officer and executive leader of public and private companies.

   will continue to serve until the election and qualification of his or
   her successor, or his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal.

   Classified Board of Directors

   Our restated certificate of incorporation that will be in effect upon
   the completion of this offering provides that, upon the completion of
   this offering, our board of directors will be divided into three
   classes with staggered three-year terms. Upon expiration of the term of
   a class of directors, directors for that class will be elected for
   three-year terms at the annual meeting of stockholders in the year in
   which that term expires. As a result, only one class of directors will
   be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders, with the other
   classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year
   terms. Each directors term will continue until the election and
   qualification of his or her successor, or his or her earlier death,
   resignation, or removal. Our directors will be divided among the three
   classes as follows:


     

   Class I directors, whose initial term will expire at the annual meeting
   of stockholders to be held in fiscal 2021, will consist of Howard
   Draft, Erik Blachford, and Pamela Thomas-Graham;


     

   Class II directors, whose initial term will expire at the annual
   meeting of stockholders to be held in fiscal 2022, will consist of John
   Callaghan and Jay Hoag; and


     

   Class III directors, whose initial term will expire at the annual
   meeting of stockholders to be held in fiscal 2023, will consist of John
   Foley, William Lynch, and Karen Boone.

   Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws that will
   be in effect upon the completion of this offering provide that only our
   board of directors may fill vacancies on our board. Any additional
   directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors
   will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as
   possible, each class will consist of one-third of the total number of
   directors.

   The classification of our board of directors may have the effect of
   delaying or preventing changes in our control or management. See the
   section titled Description of Capital StockAnti-Takeover
   ProvisionsRestated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws
   Provisions for additional information.

   Director Independence

   Our Class A common stock will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select
   Market. Under the rules of Nasdaq, independent directors must comprise
   a majority of a listed companys board of directors within a specified
   period of the completion of this offering. In addition, rules require
   that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed
   companys audit, compensation, and nominating, governance, and
   corporate responsibility committees be independent. Under rules, a
   director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the
   opinion of that companys board of directors, that person does not have
   a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent
   judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

   Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set
   forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. In order to be considered
   independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee
   of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a
   member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other
   board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting,
   advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of
   its subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company
   or any of its subsidiaries. We intend to satisfy the audit committee
   independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 as of the closing of this
   offering.

   Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of
   each director and considered whether each director has a material
   relationship with us that could compromise his or her ability to
   exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her
   responsibilities. As a result of this review, our board of directors
   determined that Mses. Boone and Thomas-Graham and Messrs. Blachford,
   Callaghan, Draft, and Hoag are independent directors as defined under
   the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing
   requirements and rules of Nasdaq. In making these determinations, our
   board of directors reviewed and discussed information provided by the
   directors and us with regard to each directors business and personal
   activities and current and prior relationships as they may relate to us
   and our management, including the beneficial ownership of our capital
   stock by each non-employee director and the transactions involving them
   described in the section titled Certain Relationships and Related
   Party Transactions.

   independent director. As lead independent director, Mr. Blachford will

   otherwise determined by our board of directors. Each committee will

   and regulations. In addition, our board of directors has determined
   that Ms. Boone is an audit committee financial expert as defined in
   Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.
   This designation does not impose on Ms. Boone any duties, obligations,
   or liabilities that are greater than are generally imposed on members
   of our audit committee and our board of directors. Each member of our

   assessment and risk management, including cybersecurity risks, and

   services to be performed by the independent registered public
   accounting firm.

   Compensation Committee

   Our compensation committee is comprised of Ms. Thomas-Graham and

   compensation committee. The composition of our compensation committee
   meets the requirements for independence under the current listing
   standards and SEC rules and regulations. Each member of this committee
   is a non-employee director, as defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
   the Exchange Act. Our compensation committee is responsible for, among
   other things:


     

   reviewing and approving the compensation and the terms of any
   compensatory agreements of our executive officers;


     

   Ms. Thomas-Graham is the chairperson of our nominating, governance, and

   things:

   evaluating, and overseeing the process of evaluating, the performance
   of our board of directors and individual directors; and


     

   advising our board of directors on corporate governance matters.

   Board Diversity

   Each year, our nominating, governance, and corporate responsibility
   committee will review, with the board of directors, the appropriate
   characteristics, skills and experience required for the board of
   directors as a whole and its individual members. In evaluating the
   suitability of individual candidates, our nominating, governance, and
   corporate responsibility committee will consider factors including,
   without limitation, an individuals character, integrity, judgment,
   potential conflicts of interest, other commitments, and diversity.
   While we have no formal policy regarding board diversity for our board
   of directors as a whole nor for each individual member, the nominating,
   governance, and corporate responsibility committee does consider such
   factors as gender, race, ethnicity and experience, area of expertise,
   as well as other individual attributes that contribute to the total
   diversity of viewpoints and experience represented on the board of
   directors.

   Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

   None of the members of our compensation committee is or has been an
   officer or employee of our company. None of our executive officers has
   served as a member of the board of directors, or as a member of the
   compensation or similar committee, of any entity that has one or more
   executive officers who served on our board of directors or compensation
   committee during fiscal 2019.

   Code of Conduct

   Our board of directors has adopted a code of conduct that applies to
   all of our employees, officers, and directors, which will become
   effective upon the effectiveness of this registration statement of
   which this prospectus is a part. The full text of our code of conduct
   will be posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. The
   reference to our website address in this prospectus does not include or
   incorporate by reference the information on our website into this
   prospectus. We intend to disclose future amendments to certain
   provisions of our global code of conduct, or waivers of these
   provisions, on our website or in public filings.

   The amounts reported in the Option Awards column represent the grant
   date fair value of the stock options granted to our Named Executive
   Officers during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 as computed in accordance
   with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718. The assumptions
   used in calculating the grant date fair value of the stock options
   reported in the Option Awards column are set forth in Note 13 of the
   notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
   this prospectus. Note that the amounts reported in this column reflect
   the accounting cost for these stock options and do not correspond to
   the actual economic value that may be received by our Named Executive
   Officers from the stock options.


   (2)

   The amounts reported represent the amounts earned based upon
   achievement of certain performance goals under our executive bonus
   program. Payments for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 are described in
   greater detail in the section titled Non-Equity Incentive Plan
   Compensation.

   The amount reported represents reimbursements for expenses incurred
   while commuting between Mr. Lynchs primary residence in Virginia and
   our corporate headquarters in New York, including costs related to
   personal and familial use of commercial and chartered aircrafts. These
   costs are calculated as the actual amounts reimbursed or paid by us for
   the flights.

   Ms. Woodworth joined us as our Chief Financial Officer in April 2018.

   Equity Compensation

   From time to time, we have granted equity awards in the form of stock
   options to our Named Executive Officers, which are generally subject to
   vesting based on each of our Named Executive Officers continued
   service with us. Each of our Named Executive Officers currently holds
   outstanding stock options to purchase shares of our Class B common
   stock that were granted under our 2015 Plan, as set forth in the
   Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table below.

   Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation

   Messrs. Foley and Lynch participated in our executive bonus program
   during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. Incentives under our executive
   bonus program were payable annually based on our achievement of certain
   company performance metrics, including global net revenue and adjusted
   EBITDA. For fiscal 2018, the target bonus amounts were $500,000 for
   Messrs. Foley and Lynch. For fiscal 2019, the target bonus amounts were
   $750,000 for Ms. Woodworth and Messrs. Foley and Lynch. Amounts earned
   by Messrs. Foley and Lynch for fiscal 2018 and Ms. Woodworth and
   Messrs. Foley and Lynch for fiscal 2019 under the executive bonus
   program are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table above in the
   Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column.

   or greater but less than $750,000,000 and (b) 100% of the shares will
   accelerate and vest upon a liquidity event valuing us at $750,000,000
   or greater.

   Employee Benefit Plans

   We believe that our ability to grant equity-based awards is a valuable
   compensation tool that enables us to attract, retain, and motivate our
   employees, consultants, and directors by aligning their financial
   interests with those of our stockholders. The principal features of our
   equity incentive plans are summarized below. These summaries are
   qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual text of the
   plans, which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of
   which this prospectus is a part.

   2015 Stock Plan

   Our board of directors adopted our 2015 Plan in April 2015, which was
   subsequently approved by our stockholders. Our board of directors, or a
   committee thereof appointed by our board of directors, administers the
   2015 Plan and the awards granted thereunder. Awards under our 2015 Plan
   are for shares of our Class B common stock.

   The 2015 Plan provides for the grant of both incentive stock options,
   which qualify for favorable tax treatment to their recipients under
   Section 422 of the Code, and nonqualified stock options, as well as for
   the issuance of restricted stock awards, or RSAs. We may grant
   incentive stock options only to our employees. We may grant
   nonqualified stock options and RSAs to our employees, directors, and
   consultants. We refer to such employees, directors, or consultants who
   receive an award under our 2015 Plan as participants.

   The exercise price of each stock option must be at least equal to the
   fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The maximum
   permitted term of options granted under our 2015 Plan is ten years.
   Options generally vest subject to continued service, and will cease to
   vest on the date a participant ceases to provide services to us and all
   then unvested options will be forfeited. Our board of directors, or a
   committee thereof, may provide for options to be exercised only as they
   vest or to be immediately exercisable with any shares issued on
   exercise being subject to our right of repurchase that lapses as the
   shares vest. Stock options granted under the 2015 Plan generally may be
   exercised, to the extent vested as of the date of termination, for a
   period of three months after the termination of the optionees service
   to us, for a period of six months in the case of disability, for a
   period of 12 months in the case of death or such longer or shorter
   period as our compensation committee may provide, but in any event no
   later than the expiration date of the stock option.

   An RSA is an offer by us to sell shares subject to restrictions, which
   may vest based on time or achievement of performance conditions. The
   price, if any, of an RSA will be determined by our board of directors,
   or a committee thereof. Unless otherwise determined at the time of
   award, vesting will cease on the date the participant ceases to provide
   services to us and unvested shares will be forfeited to or repurchased
   by us.

   In the event there is a specified type of change in our capital
   structure without our receipt of consideration, such as a stock split,
   appropriate adjustments will be made as set forth in the 2015 Plan. In
   the event of a merger or consolidation, or in the event of a sale of
   all or substantially all of our assets, outstanding awards under our
   2015 Plan shall be subject to the agreement evidencing the transaction
   (or, in the event the transaction does not include such an agreement,
   as determined by our board of directors), which need not treat all
   outstanding awards in an identical manner, and may include one or more
   of the following: (1) the continuation of the outstanding awards;
   (2) the assumption of the outstanding awards by the surviving
   corporation or its parent; (3) the substitution by the surviving
   corporation or its parent of new options for the outstanding options
   and new RSAs for the outstanding RSAs; (4) the cancellation of vested
   stock options or RSAs in exchange for a payment equal to the value of
   the per share consideration payable to holders of our common stock in
   the transaction and, in respect of options, less the options exercise
   price (this payment may be zero if the option or RSA has no value); (5)
   the cancellation of the outstanding awards for no consideration; (6)
   the suspension of the right to exercise options for a limited period if
   administratively necessary; or (7) the termination of early exercise
   rights so that outstanding awards may only be exercised for vested
   shares after the transaction. Our board of directors has discretion to
   accelerate, in whole or part, the vesting and exercisability of an
   option or other award in connection with a corporate transaction as
   described above.

Table of Contents

   As of June 30, 2019, we had reserved 84,008,954 shares of our Class B
   common stock for issuance under our 2015 Plan. As of June 30, 2019,
   options to purchase 64,602,124 shares had been granted and remained
   outstanding and 9,085,593 shares remained available for future grant.
   The stock options outstanding as of June 30, 2019 had a
   weighted-average exercise price of $22.05 per share. We also granted
   options to purchase 664,050 shares under the 2015 Plan subsequent to
   June 30, 2019, with an exercise price of $17.22 per share. Our 2019
   Plan (described below) will be effective upon the date immediately
   prior to the effective date of the registration statement of which this
   prospectus forms a part. As a result, we will not grant any additional
   equity awards under the 2015 Plan following that date, and the 2015
   Plan will terminate at that time. However, any outstanding stock
   options will remain outstanding, subject to the terms of our 2015 Plan
   and the applicable stock option agreements evidencing such awards,
   until such outstanding awards are exercised, or until they terminate or
   expire by their terms. Upon the effectiveness of our 2019 Plan, the
   shares reserved but not issued or subject to outstanding awards under
   our 2015 Plan will become available for grant and issuance under our
   2019 Plan as Class A common stock.

   2019 Equity Incentive Plan

   In                      2019, our board of directors adopted and our
   stockholders approved our 2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan will become
   effective on the date immediately prior to the effective date of the
   registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and will
   serve as the successor to our 2015 Plan. Our board of directors has
   delegated its authority to administer the 2019 Plan to our compensation
   committee.

   Our 2019 Plan provides for the award of both incentive stock options,
   which are intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment under
   Section 422 of the Code, and nonqualified stock options, as well as for
   RSAs, stock appreciation rights, or SARs, restricted stock units, or
   RSUs, performance awards, and stock bonuses. We may grant incentive
   stock options only to our employees. We may grant all other types of
   awards to our employees, directors, and consultants. We refer to
   employees, directors, or consultants who receive an award under our
   2019 Plan as participants.

   We reserved                shares of our Class A common stock to be
   issued under our 2019 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance
   under our 2019 Plan will increase automatically on July 1 of each of
   2020 through 2029 by the number of shares of our Class A common stock
   equal to 5% of the total outstanding shares of all of our classes of
   common stock as of the immediately preceding June 30. However, our
   board of directors may reduce the amount of the increase in any
   particular year. In addition, the following shares will be available
   for grant and issuance under our 2019 Plan as shares of our Class A
   common stock (and any shares of our Class B common stock from our 2015
   Plan that become available for grant under our 2019 Plan will be issued
   as Class A common stock):


     

   shares subject to issuance upon exercise of any stock option or SAR
   granted under our 2019 Plan but which cease to be subject to the stock
   option or SAR for any reason other than exercise of stock options or
   SARs;


     

   shares subject to awards granted under our 2019 Plan that are forfeited
   or are repurchased by us at the original issue price;


     

   shares subject to awards granted under our 2019 Plan that otherwise
   terminate without such shares being issued;


     

   shares surrendered, cancelled, or exchanged for cash or a different
   award (or combination thereof, but to the extent an award under the
   2019 Plan is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment
   will not result in reducing the number of shares available for issuance
   under the 2019 Plan);


     

   any reserved shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under
   our 2015 Plan on the effective date of our 2019 Plan;


     

   shares that are subject to stock options or other awards granted under
   our 2015 Plan that cease to be subject to such options or other awards
   by forfeiture or otherwise after the effective date of our 2019 Plan;


     

   shares issued under our 2015 Plan before the effective date of our 2019
   Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options that are forfeited after
   the effective date of our 2019 Plan;


     

   shares issued under our 2015 Plan that are repurchased by us at the
   original issue price; and


     

   shares subject to stock options or other awards that are used to pay
   the exercise price of a stock option or withheld to satisfy the tax
   withholding obligations related to any award.

   No more than                              shares of our Class A common
   stock may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options
   under the 2019 Plan.

   The exercise price of each stock option must be at least equal to the
   fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The maximum
   permitted term of options granted under our 2019 Plan is ten years. The
   compensation committee may provide for options to be exercised only as
   they vest or to be immediately exercisable with any shares issued on
   exercise being subject to our right of repurchase that lapses as the
   shares vest. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan generally may be
   exercised, to the extent vested as of the date of termination, for a
   period of three months after the termination of the optionees service
   to us, for a period of 12 months in the case of death or disability, or
   such longer or shorter period as our compensation committee may
   provide, but in any event no later than the expiration date of the
   stock option. Stock options generally terminate immediately upon
   termination of employment for cause.

   An RSA is an offer by us to sell shares of our Class A common stock
   subject to restrictions, which may vest subject to continued service
   and/or the achievement of performance conditions. The price, if any, of
   an RSA will be determined by the compensation committee. Unless
   otherwise determined by the compensation committee at the time of
   award, vesting will cease on the date the holder of the RSA no longer
   provides services to us and unvested shares will be forfeited to or
   repurchased by us.

   SARs provide for a payment, or payments, in cash or shares of our
   Class A common stock, to the holder based upon the difference between
   the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of
   exercise and the stated exercise price at grant. SARs may vest subject
   to continued service and/or the achievement of performance conditions;
   provided that no SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of 10
   years from the date the SAR is granted.

   RSUs represent the right to receive shares of our Class A common stock
   at a specified date in the future, subject to continued service and/or
   the achievement of performance conditions. If an RSU has not been
   forfeited, then on the date specified in the RSU agreement, we will
   deliver to the holder of the RSU whole shares of our Class A common
   stock, cash, or a combination of our Class A common stock and cash.

   Performance awards cover shares of our Class A common stock and may be
   settled upon achievement of the pre-established performance conditions
   as provided in the 2019 Plan in cash, by issuance of the underlying
   shares, other property, or any combination of the foregoing.

   Stock bonuses may be granted as additional compensation for service or
   performance, and may be settled in the form of cash, Class A common
   stock, or a combination thereof, and may be subject to restrictions,
   which may vest subject to continued service and/or the achievement of
   performance conditions.

   In the event of a change in the number of outstanding shares of our
   Class A common stock without consideration by reason of a stock
   dividend, extraordinary dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
   stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, combination,
   consolidation, reclassification, spin-off, or similar change in our
   capital structure, appropriate proportional adjustments will be made to
   the number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan; the
   exercise prices, number, and class of shares subject to outstanding
   options or SARs; the number and class of shares subject to other
   outstanding awards; and any applicable maximum award limits with
   respect to incentive stock options.

   In the event of a corporate transaction which constitutes a change of
   control, any or all outstanding awards may be (1) continued by the
   company, if the company is the successor entity; (2) assumed or
   substituted by the successor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary of
   the successor corporation, for substantially equivalent awards
   (including, but not limited to a payment in cash or other right to
   acquire the same consideration paid to stockholders of the company upon
   a change of control). In the event a successor corporation refuses to
   assume or substitute outstanding awards, then such awards will become
   fully vested and, as applicable, exercisable, immediately prior to the
   consummation of the proposed change of control. For purposes of the
   foregoing, any awards subject to outstanding performance-based criteria
   that are not assumed will be deemed earned and vested at 100% of target
   level unless otherwise indicated in an applicable award agreement.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a change in control, any
   outstanding awards granted to our non-employee directors under the 2019
   Plan will become vested and exercisable, as applicable, prior to the
   consummation of the change in control.

   A corporate transaction generally includes (1) a person becoming the
   beneficial owner of our securities representing more than 50% of our
   total voting power; (2) the consummation of our sale or disposition of
   all or substantially all of our assets; (3) the consummation of our
   merger or consolidation with any other corporation, except where we
   retain at least 50% of our total voting power; (4) any other
   transaction which qualifies as a corporate transaction under
   Section 424(a) of the Code wherein our stockholders give up all of
   their equity interest in us; or (5) a change in our effective control
   that


                                     123

   occurs on the date that a majority of members of our board is replaced
   during any 12-month period by members whose appointment or election is
   not endorsed by a majority of the members of our board of directors
   prior to the date of the appointment or election.

   All awards will be subject to clawback or recoupment pursuant to any
   compensation clawback or recoupment policy adopted by our board of
   directors or required by law during the term of service of the award
   holder, to the extent set forth in such policy or applicable agreement.

   Our 2019 Plan will terminate 10 years from the date our board of
   directors approves the plan, unless it is terminated earlier by our
   board of directors. Our board of directors may amend or terminate our
   2019 Plan at any time, subject to stockholder approval as may be
   required by applicable law or listing rules. No termination or
   amendment of the 2019 Plan may adversely affect any then-outstanding
   award without the consent of the affected participant.

   2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   In                      2019, our board of directors adopted and our
   stockholders approved our 2019 ESPP. The 2019 ESPP will become
   effective on the effective date of the registration statement of which
   this prospectus forms a part. We have adopted the 2019 ESPP in order to
   enable eligible employees to purchase shares of our Class A common
   stock at a discount following the date of this offering. Our 2019 ESPP
   is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under
   Section 423 of the Code. We initially reserved                  shares
   of our Class A common stock for issuance under our 2019 ESPP. The
   number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2019 ESPP will
   increase automatically on July 1 of each of 2020 through 2029 by the
   number of shares equal to 1% of the total outstanding shares of all of
   our classes of common stock as of the immediately preceding June 30,
   provided that no more than                          shares may be
   issued over the term of the 2019 ESPP. However, our board of directors
   may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year.

   Our board of directors has delegated its authority to administer the
   2019 ESPP to our compensation committee. Employees eligible to
   participate in any offering pursuant to the 2019 ESPP generally include
   any employee that is employed by us or certain of our designated
   subsidiaries at the beginning of the offering period, provided that the
   committee may exclude employees who fail to meet certain service-based
   or other requirements to the extent permitted by law. Under our 2019
   ESPP, eligible employees will be able to acquire shares of our Class A
   common stock by accumulating funds through payroll deductions.
   Generally, our eligible employees will be able to select a rate of
   payroll deduction between 1% and 15% of their base cash compensation.
   Our board of directors has the authority to amend or terminate our 2019
   ESPP, provided that except in certain circumstances such amendment or
   termination may not materially impair any outstanding purchase rights
   without the holders consent. Our 2019 ESPP will terminate on the tenth
   anniversary of its effective date, unless it is terminated earlier by
   our board of directors.

   The 2019 ESPP will be administered through a series of offering
   periods, which in no event may be longer than 27 months. Each offering
   period may itself consistent of one or more purchase periods. Unless
   otherwise determined by the board of directors or compensation
   committee, the company currently intends to establish offering periods
   of 24-months, each consisting of four six-month purchase periods.

   The purchase price for shares of our Class A common stock purchased
   under our 2019 ESPP will be 85% of the lesser of the fair market value
   of our Class A common stock on (1) the first business day of the
   applicable offering period and (2) the last business day of each
   purchase period in the applicable offering period, but in no event less
   than the par value of a share.

   No participant will have the right to purchase shares of our Class A
   common stock in an amount, when aggregated with purchase rights under
   all our employee stock purchase plans that are also in effect in the
   same calendar year, that have a fair market value of more than $25,000,
   determined as of the first day of the applicable purchase period, for
   each calendar year in which that right is outstanding. In addition, no
   participant will be permitted to purchase more than 2,500 shares of our
   Class A common stock during any one purchase period, or a lesser amount
   determined by our compensation committee.

   If the number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock is
   changed by stock dividend, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock
   split, subdivision, combination, reclassification, or similar change in
   our capital structure without consideration, then our compensation
   committee will proportionately adjust the number and class of common
   stock that is


                                     124
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   available under the 2019 ESPP, the purchase price and number of shares
   any participant has elected to purchase as well as the maximum number
   of shares which may be purchased by participants.

   If we experience a change of control transaction, any offering period
   that commenced prior to the closing of the proposed change of control
   transaction will be shortened and terminated on a new purchase date.
   The new purchase date will occur on or prior to the closing of the
   proposed change of control transaction, and our 2019 ESPP will then
   terminate on the closing of the proposed change of control.

   401(k) Plan

   We maintain a broad-based 401(k) plan that provides eligible U.S.
   employees with an opportunity to defer eligible compensation up to
   certain annual limits. As a tax-qualified retirement plan,
   contributions to the 401(k) plan are deductible by us when made, and
   contributions and earnings on those amounts are generally not taxable
   to the employees until withdrawn or distributed from the 401(k) plan.

   Limitation of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers

   Our restated certificate of incorporation that will become effective in
   connection with the completion of this offering contains provisions
   that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the
   fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Consequently, our directors will
   not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages
   for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for:


     

   any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;


     

   any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional
   misconduct or a knowing violation of law;


     

   unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or
   redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the DGCL; or


     

   any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
   benefit.

   Our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws that
   will become effective in connection with the completion of this
   offering require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the
   maximum extent not prohibited by the DGCL and allow us to indemnify
   other employees and agents as set forth in the DGCL. Subject to certain
   limitations, our restated bylaws also require us to advance expenses
   incurred by our directors and officers for the defense of any action
   for which indemnification is required or permitted.

   We have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into separate
   indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, and certain of
   our other employees, in addition to the indemnification provided for in
   our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws. These
   agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify our directors,
   officers, and key employees for certain expenses, including attorneys
   fees, judgments, penalties, fines, and settlement amounts actually
   incurred by these individuals in any action or proceeding arising out
   of their service to us or any of our subsidiaries or any other company
   or enterprise to which these individuals provide services at our
   request. Subject to certain limitations, our indemnification agreements
   also require us to advance expenses incurred by our directors,
   officers, and key employees for the defense of any action for which
   indemnification is required or permitted.

   We believe that provisions of our restated certificate of
   incorporation, restated bylaws, and indemnification agreements are
   necessary to attract and retain qualified directors, officers, and key
   employees. We also maintain directors and officers liability
   insurance.

   The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our
   restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may
   discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors
   and officers for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce
   the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and
   officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and
   other stockholders. Further, a stockholders investment may be
   adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement
   and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these
   indemnification provisions.


                                     125
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any
   of our directors or executive officers as to which indemnification is
   required or permitted, and we are not aware of any threatened
   litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for
   indemnification.

   Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
   Act may be permitted to directors, executive officers, or persons
   controlling us, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC,
   such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
   Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

                        DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

   The following description summarizes the most important terms of our
   capital stock, as they will be in effect following this offering.
   Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all the information
   that may be important to you. We expect to adopt a restated certificate
   of incorporation and restated bylaws that will become effective upon
   the completion of this offering, and this description summarizes
   provisions that are expected to be included in these documents. For a
   complete description, you should refer to our restated certificate of
   incorporation and restated bylaws, which are included as exhibits to
   the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, and
   to the applicable provisions of Delaware law.

   Upon the completion of this offering, our authorized capital stock will
   consist of                shares of our Class A common stock, $0.000025
   par value per share,                shares of our Class B common stock,
   $0.000025 par value per share, and                 shares of
   undesignated preferred stock, $0.000025 par value per share.

   Assuming the conversion and reclassification of all outstanding shares
   of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into 210,640,629 shares
   of our Class B common stock, which will occur in connection with the
   completion of this offering, as of June 30, 2019, there were
   outstanding:


     

   zero shares of our Class A common stock;


     

   235,942,233 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding, held by
   approximately 428 stockholders of record;


     

   64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon exercise of
   outstanding stock options, with a weighted-average exercise price of
   $6.71 per share; and


     

   240,000 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon exercise of a
   warrant, with an exercise price of $0.19 per share.

   Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock

   Dividend Rights

   Subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock
   outstanding at the time, the holders of our common stock are entitled
   to receive dividends out of funds legally available if our board of
   directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and then
   only at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors may
   determine. See the section titled Dividend Policy for additional
   information.

   Voting Rights

   Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each
   share of Class A common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote
   of stockholders and holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to
   20 votes for each share of Class B common stock held on all matters
   submitted to a vote of stockholders. Following this offering, the
   holders of our outstanding Class B common stock will hold     % of the
   voting power of our outstanding capital stock, with our directors,
   executive officers, and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates
   holding     % of the voting power in the aggregate. Holders of shares
   of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a
   single class on all matters (including the election of directors)
   submitted to a vote of stockholders, unless otherwise required by
   Delaware law or our restated certificate of incorporation. Delaware law
   could require either holders of our Class A common stock or Class B
   common stock to vote separately as a single class in the following
   circumstances:


     

   if we were to seek to amend our restated certificate of incorporation
   to increase or decrease the par value of a class of our capital stock,
   then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the
   proposed amendment; and


     

   if we were to seek to amend our restated certificate of incorporation
   in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences, or special
   rights of a class of our capital stock in a manner that affected its
   holders adversely, then that class would be required to vote separately
   to approve the proposed amendment.

   Our restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for
   cumulative voting for the election of directors. As a result, the
   holders of a majority of our voting shares can elect all of the
   directors then standing for election. Our restated certificate of
   incorporation establishes a classified board of directors, to be
   divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. Only one
   class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our
   stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of
   their respective three-year terms.

   No Preemptive or Similar Rights

   Our common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not
   subject to redemption or sinking fund provisions.

   Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions

   Upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, the assets legally
   available for distribution to our stockholders would be distributable
   ratably among the holders of our common stock and any participating
   preferred stock outstanding at that time, subject to the prior
   satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the
   preferential rights of and the payment of liquidation preferences, if
   any, on any shares of preferred stock outstanding at that time.

   Change of Control Transactions

   In the case of any distribution or payment in respect of the shares of
   our Class A common stock or Class B common stock upon a merger or
   consolidation with or into any other entity, or other substantially
   similar transaction, the holders of our Class A common stock and
   Class B common stock will be treated equally and identically with
   respect to shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock owned
   by them, unless the only difference in the per share distribution to
   the holders of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock is
   that any securities distributed to the holder of a share Class B common
   stock have 20 times the voting power of any securities distributed to
   the holder of a share of Class A common stock, or such merger,
   consolidation, or other transaction is approved by the affirmative vote
   of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A
   common stock and Class B common stock, each voting as a separate class.

   Subdivisions and Combinations

   If we subdivide or combine in any manner outstanding shares of Class A
   common stock or Class B common stock, the outstanding shares of the
   other class will be subdivided or combined in the same manner, unless
   different treatment of the shares of each class is approved by the
   affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
   of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, each voting as a
   separate class.

   Conversion

   Each outstanding share of Class B common stock is convertible at any
   time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common
   stock. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert
   automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon any transfer,
   whether or not for value, which occurs after the closing of this
   offering, except for certain permitted transfers described in our
   restated certificate of incorporation, including transfers to family
   members, trusts solely for the benefit of the stockholder or their
   family members, and partnerships, corporations, and other entities
   exclusively owned by the stockholder or their family members. Once
   converted or transferred and converted into Class A common stock, the
   Class B common stock may not be reissued.

   All the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock will convert
   automatically into shares of our Class A common stock upon the date
   that is the earlier of (i) the date specified by a vote of the holders
   of 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii)
   ten years from the closing of this offering, and (iii) the date the
   shares of Class B common stock cease to represent at least 1% of all
   outstanding shares of our common stock. Following such conversion, each
   share of Class A common stock will have one vote per share and the
   rights of the holders of all outstanding common stock will be
   identical. Once converted into Class A common stock, the Class B common
   stock may not be reissued.

   Preferred Stock

   Pursuant to the provisions of our restated certificate of
   incorporation, each currently outstanding share of redeemable
   convertible preferred stock will automatically be converted into one
   share of Class B common stock effective upon the completion of this
   offering. Following this offering, no shares of redeemable convertible
   preferred stock will be outstanding.

   Following the completion of this offering, our board of directors will
   be authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to
   issue preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time to
   time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the
   designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each
   series and any of its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions, in
   each case without further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board
   of directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of any
   series of preferred stock, but not below the number of shares of that
   series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our
   stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of
   preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely
   affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common
   stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in
   connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes,
   could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring, or
   preventing a change in control of our company and might adversely
   affect the market price of our Class A common stock


                                     135

   and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common
   stock and Class B common stock. We have no current plans to issue any
   shares of preferred stock.

   Stock Options

   As of June 30, 2019, we had outstanding options to purchase an
   aggregate of 64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock, with a
   weighted-average exercise price of $6.71 per share, pursuant to our
   2015 Plan. Since June 30, 2019, we have granted options to purchase an
   aggregate of 664,050 shares of our Class B common stock, with an
   exercise price of $22.05 per share, pursuant to our 2015 Stock Plan.

   Warrant

   As of June 30, 2019, we had outstanding a warrant to purchase 240,000
   shares of our Class B common stock at an exercise price of $0.19, which
   expires in June 2025. The warrant has a cashless exercise provision
   pursuant to which the holder, in lieu of paying the exercise price in
   cash, can surrender the warrant and receive a net number of shares
   based on the fair market value of such shares at the time of exercise,
   after deducting the aggregate exercise price.

   Registration Rights

   We will pay the registration expenses (other than underwriting discount
   and stock transfer taxes) of the holders of the shares registered for
   sale pursuant to the registrations described below. In an underwritten
   offering, the managing underwriter, if any, has the right, subject to
   specified conditions, to limit the number of shares such holders may
   include. In connection with the completion of this offering,
   substantially all of our stockholders that have registration rights
   agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities without the
   prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan
   Securities LLC for a period of 180 days after the date of this
   prospectus, subject to certain terms and conditions and provided that
   if (1) at least 120 days have elapsed since the date of this
   prospectus, (2) we have publicly released our earnings results for the
   quarterly period during which this offering occurred and (3) such
   lock-up period is scheduled to end during or within five trading days
   prior to a blackout period, such lock-up period will end ten trading
   days prior to the commencement of such blackout period. See the section
   titled Underwriting for additional information.

   Following the completion of this offering, the holders of certain
   outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and the holders of
   shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon conversion of our
   redeemable convertible preferred stock, or their permitted transferees,
   will be entitled to rights with respect to the registration of these
   shares under the Securities Act. These shares are referred to as
   registrable securities. Immediately following this offering, there will
   be approximately                registrable securities outstanding.
   These rights are provided under the terms of our fourth amended and
   restated investors rights agreement between us and the holders of
   these shares, which was entered into in April 2019, and include
   requested registration rights, Form S-3 registration rights, and
   piggyback registration rights. In any registration made pursuant to
   such amended and restated investor rights agreement, all fees, costs,
   and expenses of underwritten registrations, including fees and
   disbursements of one special counsel to the selling stockholders, will
   be borne by us and all selling expenses, including the estimated
   underwriting discount, will be borne by the holders of the shares being
   registered. However, we will not be required to bear the expenses in
   connection with the exercise of the requested and Form S-3 registration
   rights of a registration if the request is subsequently withdrawn at
   the request of the selling stockholders holding a majority of
   registrable securities to be registered.

   The registration rights terminate upon the earlier of (1) five years
   following the completion of this offering or (2) as to any given holder
   of registration rights, at such time following this offering when such
   holder of registration rights (a) can sell all of such holders
   registrable securities in compliance with Rule 144(b)(1)(i) or
   (b) holds 1% or less of our outstanding common stock and all
   registrable securities held by such holder can be sold in any
   three-month period without registration pursuant to Rule 144 under the
   Securities Act and without the requirement for us to be in compliance
   with the current public information requirement under Rule 144(c)(1).

   Requested Registration Rights

   The holders of an aggregate of 210,640,629 shares of our Class B common
   stock following this offering, or their permitted transferees, are
   entitled to demand registration rights. Under the terms of the amended
   and restated investor rights agreement, if we receive a written
   request, at any time after the earlier of (1) August 30, 2025 or
   (2) six months following the effective date of this offering, from the
   holders of at least 50% of the registrable securities then outstanding
   that we file a


                                     136
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
   registration of outstanding registrable securities, then we will be
   required, within 20 days of receipt of the written request, to use
   commercially reasonable efforts to register, as soon as practicable,
   all of the shares requested to be registered for public resale, if the
   amount of registrable securities to be registered will have aggregate
   gross proceeds (before underwriting discount) of at least
   $20.0 million. We are required to effect only three registrations
   pursuant to this provision of the amended and restated investor rights
   agreement. We may postpone the filing of a registration statement no
   more than once during any 12-month period for up to 90 days if our
   board of directors determines that the filing would be detrimental to
   us and our stockholders. We are not required to effect a requested
   registration under certain additional circumstances specified in the
   amended and restated investor rights agreement.

   Form S-3 Registration Rights

   The holders of an aggregate of 210,640,629 shares of our Class B common
   stock following this offering or their permitted transferees are also
   entitled to Form S-3 registration rights. The holders of at least 30%
   of the registrable securities then outstanding can request that we
   register all or part of their shares on Form S-3 if we are eligible and
   qualified to file a registration statement on Form S-3 and if the
   aggregate price to the public of the shares offered is at least
   $5.0 million. The stockholders may require us to effect at most two
   registration statements on Form S-3 in any 12-month period. We may
   postpone the filing of a registration statement on Form S-3 no more
   than once during any 12-month period for up to 90 days if our board of
   directors determines that the filing would be detrimental to us and our
   stockholders. We are not required to effect a registration on Form S-3
   under certain additional circumstances specified in the amended and
   restated investor rights agreement.

   Piggyback Registration Rights

   If we register any of our securities for public sale, the holders of an
   aggregate of                 shares of our Class B common stock
   following this offering or their permitted transferees are entitled to
   piggyback registration rights. However, this right does not apply to a
   registration relating to sales of securities of participants in one of
   our stock plans, a registration relating to the offer and sale of debt
   securities or a registration relating to a corporate reorganization or
   other transaction under Rule 145 of the Securities Act. The
   underwriters of any underwritten offering will have the right, in their
   sole discretion, to limit, because of marketing reasons, the number of
   shares registered by these holders, in which case the number of shares
   to be registered will be apportioned, first, to us, and second, pro
   rata among these holders, according to the total amount of securities
   entitled to be included by each holder, subject to additional
   circumstances specified in the amended and restated investor rights
   agreement.

   Anti-Takeover Provisions

   The provisions of Delaware law, our restated certificate of
   incorporation and our restated bylaws, as we expect they will be in
   effect upon the completion of this offering, could have the effect of
   delaying, deferring, or discouraging another person from acquiring
   control of our company. These provisions, which are summarized below,
   may have the effect of discouraging takeover bids. They are also
   designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of
   us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the
   benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate
   with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages
   of discouraging a proposal to acquire us because negotiation of these
   proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.

   Delaware Law

   We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, regulating
   corporate takeovers. In general, DGCL Section 203 prohibits a publicly
   held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination
   with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following
   the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless:


     

   prior to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the
   corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction
   which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;


     

   the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of
   the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced,
   excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding, but
   not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder,
   (1) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and
   (2) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants
   do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held
   subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or


                                     137
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

     

   at or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business
   combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation
   and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not
   by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of
   the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested
   stockholder.

   Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock
   sale, or other transaction or series of transactions together resulting
   in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested
   stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates,
   owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested
   stockholder status, did own 15% or more of a corporations outstanding
   voting stock. We expect the existence of this provision to have an
   anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our board of
   directors does not approve in advance. We also anticipate that DGCL
   Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium
   over the market price for the shares of common stock held by
   stockholders.

   Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaw Provisions

   Our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws will
   include a number of provisions that could deter hostile takeovers or
   delay or prevent changes in control of our management team, including
   the following:


     

   Dual Class Common Stock. As described above in the section titled
   Common StockVoting Rights, our restated certificate of
   incorporation will provide for a dual class common stock structure
   pursuant to which holders of our Class B common stock will have the
   ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder
   approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the
   shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, including
   the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such
   as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. Current
   investors, executives, and employees will have the ability to exercise
   significant influence over those matters.


     

   Board of Directors Vacancies. Our restated certificate of incorporation
   and restated bylaws will authorize only our board of directors to fill
   vacant directorships, including newly created seats. In addition, the
   number of directors constituting our board of directors is permitted to
   be set only by a resolution adopted by a majority vote of our entire
   board of directors. These provisions would prevent a stockholder from
   increasing the size of our board of directors and then gaining control
   of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its
   own nominees. This makes it more difficult to change the composition of
   our board of directors but promotes continuity of management.


     

   Classified Board. Our restated certificate of incorporation and
   restated bylaws will provide that our board of directors will be
   classified into three classes of directors. The existence of a
   classified board of directors could discourage a third party from
   making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us
   as it is more difficult and time consuming for stockholders to replace
   a majority of the directors on a classified board of directors. See the
   section titled ManagementBoard of Directors Composition for
   additional information.


     

   Directors Removed Only for Cause. Our restated certificate of
   incorporation will provide that stockholders may remove directors only
   for cause.


     

   Supermajority Requirements for Amendments of Our Restated Certificate
   of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws. Our restated certificate of
   incorporation will further provide that the affirmative vote of holders
   of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all of the then
   outstanding shares of voting stock will be required to amend certain
   provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, including
   provisions relating to the classified board, the size of the board,
   removal of directors, special meetings, actions by written consent, and
   designation of our preferred stock. In addition, the affirmative vote
   of holders of 75% of the voting power of each of our Class A common
   stock and Class B common stock, voting separately by class, will be
   required to amend the provisions of our restated certificate of
   incorporation relating to the terms of our Class B common stock. The
   affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of
   all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock will be required to
   amend or repeal our restated bylaws, although our restated bylaws may
   be amended by a simple majority vote of our board of directors.


     

   Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders. Our restated
   certificate of incorporation provides that special meetings of our
   stockholders may be called only by a majority of our board of
   directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our lead independent
   director, or our chief executive officer. Our restated certificate of
   incorporation will provide that our stockholders may not take action by
   written consent, but may only take action at annual or special meetings
   of our stockholders. As a result, holders of our capital stock would
   not be able to amend our restated bylaws or remove directors without
   holding a meeting of our stockholders called in accordance with our
   restated bylaws. Further, our restated bylaws will provide that special
   meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of


                                     138
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents



   our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our
   lead independent director, or our chief executive officer, thus
   prohibiting a stockholder from calling a special meeting. These
   provisions might delay the ability of our stockholders to force
   consideration of a proposal or for stockholders to take any action,
   including the removal of directors.


     

   Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director
   Nominations. Our restated bylaws provide advance notice procedures for
   stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of
   stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our
   annual meeting of stockholders. Our restated bylaws also specify
   certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholders
   notice. These provisions might preclude our stockholders from bringing
   matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making
   nominations for directors at our annual meeting of stockholders if the
   proper procedures are not followed. We expect that these provisions
   might also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a
   solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirers own slate of directors
   or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.


     

   No Cumulative Voting. The DGCL provides that stockholders are not
   entitled to the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors
   unless a corporations certificate of incorporation provides otherwise.
   Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws will not
   provide for cumulative voting.


     

   Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock. After the filing of our
   restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors will have
   the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up
   to shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences,
   including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of
   directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred
   stock enables our board of directors to render more difficult or to
   discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger,
   tender offer, proxy contest, or other means.


     

   Choice of Forum. Our restated certificate of incorporation will provide
   that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of
   the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative
   action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a
   breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us
   arising pursuant to the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation
   or our restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that
   is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum
   provision will not apply to claims that are vested in the exclusive
   jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery of
   the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of Chancery of the State
   of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction. For instance,
   the provision would not preclude the filing of claims brought to
   enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or Securities
   Act or the rules and regulations thereunder in federal court.

   We have applied to list our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global
   Select Market under the symbol PTON.

                       SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE

   Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of
   our Class A common stock, and we cannot predict the effect, if any,
   that market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the
   availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have
   on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to
   time. Nevertheless, sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common
   stock, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock
   options in the public market following this offering could adversely
   affect market prices prevailing from time to time and could impair our
   ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities.

   Following the completion of this offering, based on the number of
   shares of our capital stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019, we will
   have a total of                shares of our Class A common stock
   outstanding and 235,942,233 shares of our Class B common stock
   outstanding. This includes                  shares that we are selling
   in this offering, which shares may be resold in the public market
   immediately following this offering, and assumes no additional exercise
   of outstanding options. Shares of our Class B common stock are
   convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common
   stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock
   upon transfer.

   The remaining outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and
   Class B common stock will be deemed restricted securities as defined
   in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may be sold
   in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities
   Act or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule
   144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act, which rules are summarized
   below. As a result of the lock-up agreements and market standoff
   provisions described below and subject to the provisions of Rule 144 or
   Rule 701, shares will be available for sale in the public market as
   follows:


     

   beginning on the date of this prospectus, all of the shares of Class A
   common stock sold in this offering will be immediately available for
   sale in the public market;


     

   beginning 181 days after the date of this
   prospectus,                additional shares of common stock will
   become eligible for sale in the public market, of
   which                shares will be held by affiliates and subject to
   the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below;
   provided that if (1) if at least 120 days have elapsed since the date
   of this prospectus, (2) we have publicly released our earnings results
   for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred, and (3)
   the lock-up period as described below is scheduled to end during or
   within five trading days prior a blackout period, beginning on the date
   that is ten trading days prior to the commencement of such blackout
   period, such additional shares shall become eligible for sale in the
   public market; and


     

   the remainder of the shares of common stock will be eligible for sale
   in the public market from time to time thereafter upon subject to
   vesting and, in some cases, to the volume and other restrictions of
   Rule 144, as described below.

   Lock-Up Agreements and Market Stand Off Provisions

   All of our directors, executive officers, and substantially all of the
   holders of our common stock, or securities exercisable for or
   convertible into our common stock outstanding immediately prior to this
   offering, are subject to lock-up agreements or market standoff
   provisions that, subject to exceptions described under the section
   titled Underwriting below, prohibit them from offering for sale,
   selling, contracting to sell, granting any option for the sale of,
   transferring or otherwise disposing of any shares of our common stock,
   stock options, or any security or instrument related to this common
   stock, or stock option for a period of at least 180 days following the
   date of this prospectus, without the prior written consent of Goldman
   Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC; provided that if (1) at
   least 120 days have elapsed since the date of this prospectus, (2) we
   have publicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period
   during which this offering occurred and (3) such lock-up period is
   scheduled to end during or within five trading days prior to a blackout
   period, such lock-up period will end ten trading days prior to the
   commencement of such blackout period. These agreements are subject to
   certain customary exceptions. See the section titled Underwriting for
   additional information.

   Rule 144

   In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, once we have been
   subject to the public company reporting requirements of Section 13 or

   affiliates for purposes of the Securities Act at any time during the 90
   days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the shares
   proposed to be sold for at least six months, including the holding
   period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, is entitled to
   sell those shares without complying with the manner of sale, volume
   limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144, subject to compliance with
   the public information requirements of Rule 144 and the requirements of
   the lock-up and market standoff agreements, as described above. If such
   a person has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at
   least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other
   than our affiliates, then that person would be entitled to sell those
   shares (subject to the requirements of the lock-up and market standoff
   agreements, as described above) without complying with any of the
   requirements of Rule 144.

   In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, our affiliates or
   persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are entitled to sell
   upon expiration of the lock-up and market standoff provisions described
   above, within any three-month period, a number of shares that does not
   exceed the greater of:


     

   1% of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then
   outstanding, which will equal approximately shares immediately after
   this offering; or


     

   the average weekly trading volume of our Class A common stock during
   the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144
   with respect to that sale.

   Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling shares on
   behalf of our affiliates are also subject to certain manner of sale
   provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current
   public information about us.

   Rule 701

   Rule 701 generally allows a stockholder who purchased shares of our
   capital stock pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract and
   who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of our company during the
   immediately preceding 90 days to sell these shares in reliance upon
   Rule 144, but without being required to comply with the public
   information, holding period, volume limitation, or notice provisions of
   Rule 144. Rule 701 also permits affiliates of our company to sell their
   Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding
   period requirements of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares,
   however, are required by that rule to wait until 90 days after the date
   of this prospectus before selling those shares pursuant to Rule 701.
   Moreover, all Rule 701 shares are subject to lock-up agreements and or
   market standoff agreements as described above and under the section
   titled Underwriting and will not become eligible for sale until the
   expiration of those agreements.

   Registration Statements

   In connection with this offering, we intend to file one or more
   registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering
   all of the shares of our Class B common stock subject to outstanding
   stock options and the shares of our Class A common stock reserved for
   issuance under our equity incentive plans. We expect to file this
   registration statement as soon as permitted under the Securities Act.
   However, the shares registered on Form S-8 may be subject to the volume
   limitations and the manner of sale, notice, and public information
   requirements of Rule 144 and will not be eligible for resale until
   expiration of the lock-up and market standoff agreements to which they
   are subject.

   Registration Rights

   We have granted demand, Form S-3, and piggyback registration rights to
   certain of our stockholders to sell our common stock. Registration of
   the sale of these shares under the Securities Act would result in these
   shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the
   Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration,
   except for shares purchased by affiliates. See the section titled
   Description of Capital StockRegistration Rights for additional
   information.

    MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF
                          OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK

   The following summary describes the material U.S. federal income tax
   consequences of the ownership and disposition of our Class A common
   stock acquired in this offering by Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below).
   This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income
   taxes, does not discuss the potential application of the alternative
   minimum tax or the Medicare Contribution tax on net investment income,
   and does not deal with state or local taxes, U.S. federal gift, and
   estate tax laws, except to the limited extent provided below, or any
   non-U.S. tax consequences that may be relevant to Non-U.S. Holders in
   light of their particular circumstances.

   Special rules different from those described below may apply to certain
   Non-U.S. Holders that are subject to special treatment under the Code,
   such as:


     

   insurance companies, banks, and other financial institutions;


     

   tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations) and
   tax-qualified retirement plans;


     

   qualified foreign pension funds as defined in Section 897(l)(2) of
   the Code and entities all of the interests of which are held by
   qualified foreign pension funds;


     

   persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item
   of gross income with respect to our Class A common stock being taken
   into account in an applicable financial statement;


     

   non-U.S. governments and international organizations;


     

   broker-dealers and traders in securities;


     

   U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term residents of
   the United States;


     

   persons that own, or are deemed to own, more than five percent of our
   Class A common stock;


     

   controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment
   companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S.
   federal income tax;


     

   persons that hold our Class A common stock as part of a straddle,
   hedge, conversion transaction, synthetic security, or integrated
   investment or other risk reduction strategy;


     

   persons who do not hold our Class A common stock as a capital asset
   within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, for
   investment purposes); and


     

   partnerships and other pass-through entities, and investors in such
   pass-through entities (regardless of their places of organization or
   formation).

   Such Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to
   determine the U.S. federal, state, local, and other tax consequences
   that may be relevant to them.

   Furthermore, the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the
   Code, and Treasury regulations, rulings, and judicial decisions
   thereunder as of the date hereof, and such authorities may be repealed,
   revoked, or modified, possibly retroactively, and are subject to
   differing interpretations which could result in U.S. federal income tax
   consequences different from those discussed below. We have not
   requested a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, with
   respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the
   following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will
   agree with such statements and conclusions or will not take a contrary
   position regarding the tax consequences described herein, or that any
   such contrary position would not be sustained by a court.

   PERSONS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK PURSUANT
   TO THIS OFFERING SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE
   U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ACQUIRING, OWNING, AND
   DISPOSING OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR
   SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY
   OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION, INCLUDING ANY STATE, LOCAL, OR NON-U.S. TAX
   CONSEQUENCES OR ANY U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND THE
   POSSIBLE APPLICATION OF TAX TREATIES.

   For the purposes of this discussion, a Non-U.S. Holder is a
   beneficial owner of Class A common stock that is not a U.S. Holder or a
   partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder means
   a beneficial owner of our Class A


                                     142
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (1) an
   individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a
   corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal
   income tax purposes), created or organized in or under the laws of the
   United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (3) an
   estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation
   regardless of its source, or (4) a trust if it (i) is subject to the
   primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
   U.S. persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)
   have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or
   (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury
   regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

   If you are an individual non-U.S. citizen, you may, in some cases, be
   deemed to be a resident alien (as opposed to a nonresident alien) by
   virtue of being present in the United States for at least 31 days in
   the calendar year and for an aggregate of at least 183 days during a
   three-year period ending in the current calendar year. Generally, for
   this purpose, all the days present in the current year, one-third of
   the days present in the immediately preceding year, and one-sixth of
   the days present in the second preceding year, are counted.

   Resident aliens are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax as if
   they were U.S. citizens. Individuals who are uncertain of their status
   as resident or nonresident aliens for U.S. federal income tax purposes
   are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal
   income tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of our Class A
   common stock.

   Distributions

   We do not expect to make any distributions on our Class A common stock
   in the foreseeable future. If we do make distributions on our Class A
   common stock, however, such distributions made to a Non-U.S. Holder of
   our Class A common stock will constitute dividends for U.S. tax
   purposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings
   and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles).
   Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and
   profits will constitute a return of capital that is applied against and
   reduces, but not below zero, a Non-U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in
   our Class A common stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain
   realized on the sale or exchange of our Class A common stock as
   described below under Gain on Disposition of Our Class A Common
   Stock.

   Any distribution on our Class A common stock that is treated as a
   dividend paid to a Non-U.S. Holder that is not effectively connected
   with the holders conduct of a trade or business in the United States
   will generally be subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or such
   lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty
   between the United States and the Non-U.S. Holders country of
   residence. To obtain a reduced rate of withholding under a treaty, a
   Non-U.S. Holder generally will be required to provide the applicable
   withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form
   W-8BEN-E, or other appropriate form, certifying the Non-U.S. Holders
   entitlement to benefits under that treaty. Such form must be provided
   prior to the payment of dividends and must be updated periodically. If
   a Non-U.S. Holder holds stock through a financial institution or other
   agent acting on the holders behalf, the holder will be required to
   provide appropriate documentation to such agent. The holders agent
   will then be required to provide certification to the applicable
   withholding agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. If
   you are eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax under an
   income tax treaty, you should consult with your own tax advisor to
   determine if you are able to obtain a refund or credit of any excess
   amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for a refund
   with the IRS.

   We generally are not required to withhold tax on dividends paid to a
   Non-U.S. Holder that are effectively connected with the holders
   conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if
   required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a
   permanent establishment that the holder maintains in the United States)
   if a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI, stating that the dividends are
   so connected, is furnished to the applicable withholding agent. In
   general, such effectively connected dividends will be subject to U.S.
   federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated rates
   applicable to U.S. persons. A corporate Non-U.S. Holder receiving
   effectively connected dividends may also be subject to an additional
   branch profits tax, which is imposed, under certain circumstances, at
   a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable
   treaty) on the corporate Non-U.S. Holders effectively connected
   earnings and profits, subject to certain adjustments.

   See also the section below titled Foreign Accounts for additional
   withholding rules that may apply to dividends paid to certain foreign
   financial institutions or non-financial foreign entities.

   Gain on Disposition of Our Class A Common Stock

   Subject to the discussions below under the sections titled Backup
   Withholding and Information Reporting, a Non-U.S. Holder generally
   will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax with
   respect to gain realized on a sale or other


                                     143
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   disposition of our Class A common stock unless (1) the gain is
   effectively connected with a trade or business of the holder in the
   United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
   attributable to a permanent establishment that the holder maintains in
   the United States), (2) the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien
   individual and is present in the United States for 183 or more days in
   the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are
   met, or (3) we are or have been a United States real property holding
   corporation within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) at any time
   within the shorter of the five-year period preceding such disposition
   or the holders holding period in the Class A common stock.

   If you are a Non-U.S. Holder described in (1) above, you will be
   required to pay tax on the net gain derived from the sale at the
   regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to U.S.
   persons. Corporate Non-U.S. Holders described in (1) above may also be
   subject to the additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or such
   lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. If
   you are an individual Non-U.S. Holder described in (2) above, you will
   be required to pay a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale,
   which gain may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (even though you
   are not considered a resident of the United States), provided you have
   timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such
   losses. With respect to (3) above, in general, we would be a United
   States real property holding corporation if United States real property
   interests (as defined in the Code and the Treasury Regulations)
   comprised (by fair market value) at least half of our assets. We
   believe that we are not, and do not anticipate becoming, a United
   States real property holding corporation. However, there can be no
   assurance that we will not become a United States real property holding
   corporation in the future. Even if we are treated as a United States
   real property holding corporation, gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder
   on a disposition of our Class A common stock will not be subject to
   U.S. federal income tax so long as (1) the Non-U.S. Holder owned,
   directly, indirectly, or constructively, no more than five percent of
   our Class A common stock at all times within the shorter of (i) the
   five-year period preceding the disposition or (ii) the holders holding
   period and (2) our Class A common stock is regularly traded on an
   established securities market. There can be no assurance that our
   Class A common stock will qualify as regularly traded on an established
   securities market.

   U.S. Federal Estate Tax

   The estates of nonresident alien individuals generally are subject to
   U.S. federal estate tax on property with a U.S. situs. Because we are a
   U.S. corporation, our Class A common stock will be U.S. situs property
   and, therefore, will be included in the taxable estate of a nonresident
   alien decedent, unless an applicable estate tax treaty between the
   United States and the decedents country of residence provides
   otherwise. The terms resident and nonresident are defined
   differently for U.S. federal estate tax purposes than for U.S. federal
   income tax purposes. Investors are urged to consult their own tax
   advisors regarding the U.S. federal estate tax consequences of the
   ownership or disposition of our Class A common stock.

   Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

   Generally, we or certain financial middlemen must report information to
   the IRS with respect to any dividends we pay on our Class A common
   stock, including the amount of any such dividends, the name and address
   of the recipient, and the amount, if any, of tax withheld. A similar
   report is sent to the holder to whom any such dividends are paid.
   Pursuant to tax treaties or certain other agreements, the IRS may make
   its reports available to tax authorities in the recipients country of
   residence.

   Dividends paid by us (or our paying agents) to a Non-U.S. Holder may
   also be subject to U.S. backup withholding. U.S. backup withholding
   generally will not apply to a Non-U.S. Holder who provides a properly
   executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or
   otherwise establishes an exemption, provided that the applicable
   withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know the
   holder is a U.S. person.

   Under current U.S. federal income tax law, U.S. information reporting
   and backup withholding requirements generally will apply to the
   proceeds of a disposition of our Class A common stock effected by or
   through a U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or non-U.S., unless the
   Non-U.S. Holder provides a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS
   Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or otherwise meets documentary evidence
   requirements for establishing non-U.S. person status or otherwise
   establishes an exemption. Generally, U.S. information reporting and
   backup withholding requirements will not apply to a payment of
   disposition proceeds to a Non-U.S. Holder where the transaction is
   effected outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a
   non-U.S. broker. Information reporting and backup withholding
   requirements may, however, apply to a payment of disposition proceeds
   if the broker has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the holder
   is, in fact, a U.S. person. For information reporting purposes only,
   certain U.S. related brokers may be treated in a manner similar to U.S.
   brokers.


                                     144
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   Backup withholding is not an additional tax. If backup withholding is
   applied to you, you should consult with your own tax advisor to
   determine whether you have overpaid your U.S. federal income tax, and
   whether you are able to obtain a tax refund or credit of the overpaid
   amount.

   Foreign Accounts

   In addition, U.S. federal withholding taxes may apply under the Foreign
   Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, on certain types of payments,
   including dividends on our Class A common stock, made to non-U.S.
   financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities.
   Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on our
   Class A common stock paid to a foreign financial institution or a
   non-financial foreign entity (each as defined in the Code), unless
   (1) the foreign financial institution agrees to undertake certain
   diligence and reporting obligations, (2) the non-financial foreign
   entity either certifies it does not have any substantial United States
   owners (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information
   regarding each substantial United States owner, or (3) the foreign
   financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise
   qualifies for an exemption from these rules. The 30% federal
   withholding tax described in this paragraph cannot be reduced under an
   income tax treaty with the United States. If the payee is a foreign
   financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting
   requirements in (1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the
   U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it
   undertake to identify accounts held by certain specified United States
   persons or United States-owned foreign entities (each as defined in
   the Code), annually report certain information about such accounts, and
   withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial
   institutions and certain other account holders. Foreign financial
   institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental
   agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to
   different rules. Under the applicable Treasury Regulations and
   administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to
   payments of dividends on our common stock, and will apply to payments
   of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such stock on
   or after January 1, 2019, although under recently proposed regulations
   (the preamble to which specifies that taxpayers are permitted to rely
   on such proposed regulations pending finalization), no withholding
   would apply with respect to payments of gross proceeds.

   Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the
   potential application of withholding under FATCA to their investment in
   our Class A common stock.

   EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING
   THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING, HOLDING, AND DISPOSING OF OUR CLASS
   A COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGE IN
   APPLICABLE LAW, AS WELL AS TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE,
   LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS SUCH AS ESTATE AND
   GIFT TAX.

   A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the web
   sites maintained by one or more underwriters, or selling group members,
   if any, participating in the initial public offering. The underwriters
   may agree to allocate a number of shares to underwriters and selling
   group members for sale to their online brokerage account holders.
   Internet distributions will be allocated by the representatives to
   underwriters and selling group members that may make internet
   distributions on the same basis as other allocations.

   Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered
   at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover of this
   prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers
   may be sold at a discount of up to $                per share from the
   initial public offering price. After the initial offering of the
   shares, the representatives may change the offering price and the other
   selling terms. Sales of shares made outside of the United States may be
   made by affiliates of the underwriters. The offering of the shares by
   the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to
   the underwriters right to reject any order in whole or in part.

   We and our executive officers, directors, and holders of substantially
   all of our common stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable
   for our common stock have agreed or will agree with the underwriters,
   subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of our or
   their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
   shares of common stock during the period from the date of this
   prospectus continuing through the date 180 days after the date of this
   prospectus, except with the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs &
   Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC; provided that if (1) at least
   120 days have elapsed since the date of this prospectus, (2) we have
   publicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period during
   which this offering occurred, and (3) such lock-up period is scheduled
   to end during or within five trading days prior to a blackout period,
   such lock-up period will end ten trading days prior to the commencement
   of such blackout period. We will announce the date of any expected
   blackout-related release to the lock-up at least two trading days in
   advance of such release. This agreement does not apply to any existing
   employee benefit plans. See the section titled Shares Eligible for
   Future Sale for a discussion of certain transfer restrictions.

   Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares
   of our Class A common stock. The initial public offering price has been
   negotiated between the representatives and us. Among the factors to be
   considered in determining the initial public offering price of the
   shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be our
   historical performance, estimates of our business potential and
   earnings prospects of the company, an assessment of our management and
   the consideration of the above factors in relation to market valuation
   of companies in related businesses. Neither we nor the underwriters can
   assure investors that an active trading market will develop for our
   Class A common stock or that the shares will trade in the public market
   at or above the initial public offering price.

   We have applied to list our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global
   Select Market under the symbol PTON.

   In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell
   shares of Class A common stock in the open market. These transactions
   may include short sales, stabilizing transactions, and purchases to
   cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by
   the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required
   to purchase in the offering, and a short position represents the amount
   of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A
   covered short position is a short position that is not greater than
   the amount of additional shares for which the underwriters option
   described above may be exercised. The underwriters may cover any
   covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase
   additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In


                                     147
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   determining the source of shares to cover the covered short position,
   the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares
   available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at
   which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option
   described above. Naked short sales are any short sales that create a
   short position greater than the amount of additional shares for which
   the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must
   cover any such naked short position by purchasing shares in the open
   market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the
   underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the
   price of the Class A common stock in the open market after pricing that
   could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.
   Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of
   Class A common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior
   to the completion of the offering.

   The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a
   particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the
   underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have
   repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in
   stabilizing or short covering transactions.

   Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as
   well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may
   have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market
   price of our stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty
   bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of
   our Class A common stock. As a result, the price of our Class A common
   stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the
   open market. The underwriters are not required to engage in these
   activities and may end any of these activities at any time. These
   transactions may be effected on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, in the
   over-the-counter market or otherwise.

   We estimate that our share of the total expenses of the offering,
   excluding underwriting discount, will be approximately
   $                 . We have agreed to reimburse the underwriters for
   certain expenses incurred by them in connection with this offering.

   We have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain
   liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

   Other than in the United States, no action has been taken by us or the
   underwriters that would permit a public offering of the securities
   offered by this prospectus in any jurisdiction where action for that
   purpose is required. The securities offered by this prospectus may not
   be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this prospectus or
   any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the
   offer and sale of any such securities be distributed or published in
   any jurisdiction, except under circumstances that will result in
   compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of that
   jurisdiction. Persons into whose possession this prospectus comes are
   advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions
   relating to the offering and the distribution of this prospectus. This
   prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an
   offer to buy any securities offered by this prospectus in any
   jurisdiction in which such an offer or a solicitation is unlawful.

   The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service
   financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include
   sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory,
   investment management, investment research, principal investment,
   hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial
   activities and services. Certain of the underwriters and their
   respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a
   variety of these services to us and to persons and entities with
   relationships with us, for which they received or will receive
   customary fees and expenses.

   In June 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase
   Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and Bank of America, N.A.,
   Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, and Silicon
   Valley Bank, as joint syndication agents, which amended and restated
   the loan and security agreement that we previously entered into in
   November 2017. The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million
   secured revolving credit facility, including up to the lesser of
   $150.0 million and the aggregate unused amount of the facility for the
   issuance of letters of credit. The principal amount, if any, is payable
   in full in June 2024. As of June 30, 2019, we had not drawn on the
   credit facility and did not have outstanding borrowings under the
   Credit Agreement. See the section titled Managements Discussion and
   Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and
   Capital Resources for additional information.

   In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the

           Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

   To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Peloton Interactive,
   Inc.

   Opinion on the Financial Statements

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Peloton
   Interactive, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the
   related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss,
   cash flows and changes in redeemable convertible preferred stock and
   stockholders deficit for each of the three years in the period ended
   June 30, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
   consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated
   financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
   financial position of the Company at June 30, 2018 and 2019, and the
   results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
   years in the period ended June 30, 2019, in conformity with U.S.
   generally accepted accounting principles.

   Basis for Opinion

   These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
   management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
   Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
   accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
   Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
   respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
   laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
   Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
   Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
   reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
   material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is
   not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
   internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are
   required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
   reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
   effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
   reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

   Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
   material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
   or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
   procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
   amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
   included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
   estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
   presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
   provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

   We have served as the Companys auditor since 2017.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation

   Description and Organization

   Peloton Interactive, Inc. (Peloton or the Company) is the largest
   interactive fitness platform in the world with a loyal community of
   Members, which we define as any individual who has a Peloton account.
   The Company pioneered connected, technology-enabled fitness and the
   streaming of immersive, instructor-led boutique classes to its Members
   anytime, anywhere. The Company makes fitness entertaining,
   approachable, effective, and convenient while fostering social
   connections that encourage its Members to be the best versions of
   themselves.

   The Company markets and sells its interactive fitness products
   (Connected Fitness Products) directly through its retail showrooms
   and at www.onepeloton.com. The Company was founded in 2012 and
   incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015. As of June 30, 2019, the
   Company had established wholly owned subsidiaries in the United States,
   the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany and its corporate headquarters
   is in New York, New York.

   The Company organizes its business into the following three reportable
   segments: Connected Fitness Products, Subscription and Other. See Note
   17, Segment Information, for further discussion of the Companys
   segment reporting structure.

   Basis of Presentation

   The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
   accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

   Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included
   elsewhere in these financial statements have been subject to rounding
   adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may
   not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and
   figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as
   applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of
   the percentages that precede them.

   Basis of Consolidation

   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Peloton
   Interactive, Inc. and its subsidiaries in which the Company has a
   controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances
   and transactions have been eliminated.

   Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet Information

   The unaudited pro forma balance sheet information as of June 30, 2019
   presents the Companys stockholders deficit as though all of the
   Companys redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding had
   automatically converted into an aggregate of 210,640,629 shares of the
   Companys common stock, upon the completion of a qualifying initial
   public offering (IPO) of the Companys common stock. The shares of
   common stock issuable and the proceeds expected to be received by the
   Company upon the completion of a qualifying IPO are excluded from such
   pro forma financial information.

   2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   Cash and Cash Equivalents

   The Company considers all cash and short-term investments purchased
   with maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash
   equivalents. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Companys cash and cash
   equivalents were substantially held in money market and operating
   accounts. At various times during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018
   and 2019, the balances of cash at financial institutions exceeded the
   federally insured limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in
   such accounts and believes cash and cash equivalents are not subject to
   any significant credit risk.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   Restricted Cash

   Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held in reserve accounts
   related to operating lease obligations.

   Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowances

   The Companys accounts receivable primarily represent amounts due from
   third-party sales processors. On a periodic basis, the Company
   evaluates accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible, which to
   date have not been material, and provides allowances, as necessary, for
   doubtful accounts.

   Revenue Recognition

   Adoption of Topic 606

   On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 and all subsequent
   amendments. The Company elected to apply the standard and all related
   ASUs retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. The
   adoption of the new standard had no material impact on the measurement
   or recognition of revenue, resulting in no adjustments to the prior
   periods. Additional disclosures, however, have been added in accordance
   with ASU 2014-09. Refer to Note 3, Revenue.

   Shipping and Delivery Fees

   The Company accounts for shipping, delivery and installation fees, net
   of discounts and refunds, billed to customers as revenue.

   Sales Taxes

   Sales tax collected from customers and remitted to governmental
   authorities is not included in revenue and is reflected as a liability
   on the balance sheet.

   Inventories

   Inventories consist of finished goods, which are generally purchased
   from contract manufacturers. Connected Fitness Product, accessories,
   and apparel inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a
   weighted-average cost basis. The Company assesses the valuation of
   inventory and periodically adjusts the value for estimated excess and
   obsolete inventory based upon estimates of future demand and market
   conditions, as well as damaged or otherwise impaired goods. Spare parts
   are recorded as inventory and recognized in cost of goods sold as
   consumed.

   Marketable Securities

   The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as
   available-for-sale and, accordingly, records them at fair value.
   Marketable securities with original maturities of greater than three
   months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as
   current investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be
   classified as current based on their highly liquid nature and because
   such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is
   available for current operations. Unrealized holding gains and losses,
   which are immaterial, are excluded from earnings and are reported net
   of tax in other comprehensive income until realized. Dividend and
   interest income is recognized when earned. Realized gains and losses,
   are included in earnings and are derived using the specific
   identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.

   Property and Equipment

   Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
   depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated
   using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
   assets. For leasehold improvements, the useful life is the lesser of
   the applicable lease term or the expected asset life. Charges for
   repairs and maintenance that do

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed
   as incurred. The Company capitalizes the cost of pre-production tooling
   which it owns during a supply arrangement. Pre-production tooling and
   engineering costs the Company will not own or will not be used in
   producing products under long-term supply arrangements are expensed as
   incurred.

   Internal-Use Software

   The Company capitalizes certain qualified costs incurred in connection
   with the development of internal-use software. The Company evaluates
   the costs incurred during the application development stage of internal
   use software and website development to determine whether the costs
   meet the criteria for capitalization. Costs related to preliminary
   project activities and post implementation activities including
   maintenance are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs related to
   internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
   estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed three years.
   Capitalized costs less accumulated amortization are included within
   property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.

   Goodwill and Intangible Assets

   Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration
   transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest, if
   any, over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and
   liabilities assumed in a business combination. The Company has no
   intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

   Intangible assets other than goodwill are comprised of acquired
   developed technology. At initial recognition, intangible assets
   acquired in a business combination are recognized at their fair value
   as of the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition,
   intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and
   impairment losses, if any, and are amortized on a straight-line basis
   over the estimated useful life of the asset.

   The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events
   or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. In
   conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first reviews
   qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not
   that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
   amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit
   is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative
   assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by
   analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows. If the
   carrying value of the reporting unit continues to exceed its fair
   value, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is
   calculated and an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded. The
   Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of
   each fiscal year.

   The Company assesses the impairment of intangible assets whenever
   events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
   may not be recoverable.

   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

   Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
   changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
   may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is
   measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future
   undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
   the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted net
   future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by
   which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds fair value.

   Cost of Revenue

   Connected Fitness Products

   Cost of revenue consists of product costs, including manufacturing
   costs, duties and other applicable importing costs, shipping and
   handling costs, packaging, warranty replacement costs, fulfillment
   costs, warehousing costs, and certain allocated costs related to
   management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses associated with
   supply chain logistics.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   Subscription

   Subscription cost of revenue includes costs associated with content
   creation and cost to stream content to our Members across the Companys
   platform. These costs consist of both fixed costs, including studio
   rent and occupancy, other studio overhead and instructor and production
   personnel costs, and variable costs, including music royalty fees,
   content costs for past use, third-party platform streaming costs, and
   payment processing fees for our monthly subscription billings.

   Music Royalty Fees

   The Company recognizes music royalty fees on all music it streams to
   Members as these fees are incurred in accordance with the terms of the
   relevant license agreement with the music rights holder. The incurrence
   of the royalties is primarily driven by content usage by the Companys
   Members on a fee-per-play basis through the use of the Companys
   Subscriptions and classified within subscription cost of revenue within
   the Companys statement of operations. The Companys license agreements
   with music rights holders generally include provisions for advance
   royalties as well as minimum guarantees. When a minimum guarantee is
   paid in advance, the guarantee is recorded as a prepaid expense and
   amortized to subscription cost of revenue.

   As the Company executes music license agreements with various music
   rights holders for go-forward usage, the Company may also
   simultaneously enter into a settlement agreement whereby the Company is
   released from all potential licensor claims regarding the Companys
   alleged past use of copyrighted material in exchange for a negotiated
   payment. These are referred to as content costs for past use and are
   recorded within subscription cost of revenue. The Company has entered
   into agreements with music rights holders who represent all the music
   catalogs that the Company needs to operate its service, however, given
   the uncertain and opaque nature of music rights ownership, the
   Companys archived library may continue to include music for which
   certain rights or fractional interests have not been accurately
   determined or fully licensed. Prior to the execution of a music license
   agreement, the Company estimates and records a charge based upon
   license agreements previously entered into and the market share and
   size of the music rights holder.

   Income Taxes

   The Company utilizes the asset and liability method for computing its
   income tax provision. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the
   expected future consequences of temporary differences between the
   financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as
   operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards, using
   enacted tax rates. Management makes estimates, assumptions, and
   judgments to determine the Companys provision for income taxes,
   deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance
   recorded against deferred tax assets. The Company assesses the
   likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future
   taxable income and, to the extent the Company believes recovery is not
   likely, establishes a valuation allowance.

   The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
   only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained
   on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits
   of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are
   then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
   likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties
   related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been
   material, are recognized within income tax expense.

   Research and Development Costs

   Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel- and
   facilities-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses,
   tooling and prototype materials and software platform expenses.
   Substantially all of the Companys research and development expenses
   are related to developing new products and services and improving
   existing products and services. Research and development expenses are
   expensed as incurred. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018,
   and 2019, research and development costs were $13.0 million,
   $23.4 million, $54.8 million, respectively.

   Stock-Based Compensation

   Stock-based awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair
   value of the award and are recognized as expense, net of actual
   forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
   period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.
   For performance-based options issued, the value of the instrument is
   measured at the grant date as the fair value of the award and expensed
   over the vesting term under an accelerated attribution method when the
   performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. The
   Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the
   Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of the grant date
   fair value of stock awards issued is affected by a number of variables,
   including the fair value of the Companys common stock, the expected
   common stock price volatility over the expected life of the options,
   the expected term of the stock option, risk-free interest rates, and
   the expected dividend yield of the Companys common stock. The Company
   derives its volatility from the average historical stock volatilities
   of several peer public companies over a period equivalent to the
   expected term of the awards. The Company estimates the expected term
   based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to
   be plain vanilla options, as the Companys historical share option
   exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to
   estimate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the
   United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
   Expected dividend yield is 0.0% as the Company has not paid and does
   not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock.

   Generally, the Companys stock options plans permit early exercise. The
   unvested portion of shares exercised is recorded as a liability on the
   Companys balance sheet and reclassified to equity as vesting occurs.

   Common Stock Valuations

   The Company has historically granted stock options at exercise prices
   equal to the fair value as determined by the Companys Board of
   Directors (Board of Directors) on the date of grant. In the absence
   of a public trading market, the Board of Directors, with input from
   management, exercises significant judgment and consider numerous
   objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of the
   Companys common stock as of the date of each stock option grant,
   including:


     

   relevant precedent transactions involving the Companys capital stock;


     

   the liquidation preferences, rights, preferences, and privileges of the
   Companys redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to the common
   stock;


     

   the Companys actual operating and financial performance;


     

   current business conditions and projections;


     

   the Companys stage of development;


     

   the likelihood and timing of achieving a liquidity event for the shares
   of common stock underlying the stock options, such as an initial public
   offering, given prevailing market conditions;


     

   any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability of the
   common stock underlying the granted options;


     

   recent secondary stock sales and tender offers;


     

   the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and


     

   U.S. and global capital market conditions.

   In addition, the Board of Directors considers the independent
   valuations completed by a third-party valuation consultant. The
   valuations of the Companys common stock are determined in accordance
   with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified
   Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company
   Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.

   Share Repurchases

   Shares of the Companys common and preferred stock may be repurchased
   from time to time as authorized by the Board of Directors. Share
   repurchases are funded from existing cash balances, and repurchased
   shares are retired and returned to


                                    F-12

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   unissued authorized shares. These repurchases are accounted for as
   reductions to the Companys common and preferred stock to the extent
   available with remaining amounts allocated against retained earnings.

   Use of Estimates

   The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to
   make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
   assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosures. On
   an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, among
   others, those related to income taxes, the realizability of inventory,
   stock-based compensation, contingencies, revenue-related reserves,
   content costs for past use reserve, fair value measurements, useful
   lives of property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets,
   and impairment of goodwill, intangible, and long-lived assets. The
   Company bases its estimates on historical experience, market
   conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
   reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

   Commitments and Contingencies

   Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments,
   litigation, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it
   is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
   assessment can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is reasonably
   possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, the
   Company discloses the possible loss or states that such an estimate
   cannot be made.

   Fair Value of Financial Instruments

   Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
   paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
   advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
   transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
   Subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and
   liabilities are recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income
   when they occur. When determining the fair value measurements for
   assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value,
   the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in
   which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurement
   or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets
   or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and
   credit risk.

   The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which
   prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and
   bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of
   input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:


     

   Level 1 inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for
   identical assets or liabilities.


     

   Level 2 inputs are based on observable inputs other than Level 1
   prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted
   prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions
   (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all
   significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or
   corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term
   of the assets or liabilities.


     

   Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation
   methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of
   assets or liabilities, and typically reflect managements estimates of
   assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
   liability.

   The Companys material financial instruments consist primarily of cash
   and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable,
   accounts payable, and accrued expenses. The carrying values of the
   Companys accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses
   approximated their fair values at June 30, 2018 and 2019, due to the
   short period of time to maturity or repayment.

   Earnings (Loss) Per Share

   The Company computes net income (loss) per share using the two-class
   method required for participating securities. The two-class method
   requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be
   allocated between common


                                    F-13

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights
   to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been
   distributed. The Companys redeemable convertible preferred stock and
   common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are
   participating securities. The Company considers any shares issued upon
   early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be
   participating securities because holders of such shares have
   non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a cash dividend is
   declared on common stock. These participating securities do not
   contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the
   Companys losses. As such, net losses for the periods presented were
   not allocated to the Companys participating securities.

   Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average
   number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted
   earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number
   of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential
   shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potential shares
   of common stock consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed
   exercise of stock options and warrants as well as the redeemable
   convertible preferred shares. During the fiscal years ended June 30,
   2017 and 2019, the excess of the repurchase price of preferred stock
   over its carrying value (see Note 12) has been recorded as an increase
   to net loss to determine net loss attributable to common stockholders.

   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

   Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

   ASU 2014-09

   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
   Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
   Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 replaces most existing revenue
   recognition guidance, and requires companies to recognize revenue based
   upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers
   in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
   expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In
   addition, the standard requires disclosures related to the nature,
   timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
   contracts with customers. The Company applied the five-step method
   outlined in ASU 2014-09 to all revenue streams and elected the full
   retrospective method for its adoption of the standard as of July 1,
   2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on
   the Companys consolidated financial statements. The additional
   disclosures required by ASU 2014-09 are included in Note 3, Revenue.

   ASU 2016-09

   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee
   Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects
   of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the
   income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
   liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The
   standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods,
   and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
   December 15, 2016. For all other entities, including emerging growth
   companies, the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after
   December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning
   after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in
   any interim or annual period. The Company early adopted ASU 2016-09 as
   of July 1, 2017. With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company accounts
   for forfeitures as they occur. The Company applied the guidance on a
   modified retrospective basis, which resulted in a $0.5 million
   cumulative effect adjustment and increase to accumulated deficit as of
   July 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2018 did not have a
   material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

   ASU 2017-01

   In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations
   (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The standard
   provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether
   transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or
   businesses. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets
   acquired is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets,
   the assets acquired are not considered a business. For public entities,
   this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
   December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting
   period. For all other entities, including emerging growth companies,
   this standard is effective for annual reporting periods

   beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within annual
   periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted ASU
   2017-01 as of July 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have
   a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

   ASU 2017-09

   In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock
   Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, to provide
   clarity and reduce both diversity in practice and cost complexity when
   applying the guidance in Topic 718 to a change to the terms and
   conditions of a stock-based payment award. ASU 2017-09 also provides
   guidance about the types of changes to the terms or conditions of a
   share-based payment award that require an entity to apply modification
   accounting in accordance with Topic 718. The standard is effective for
   annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim
   periods therein. The Company adopted this update as of July 1, 2018.
   The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
   Companys consolidated financial statements.

   ASU 2018-15

   In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customers Accounting for
   Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is
   a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 requires implementation costs incurred
   by customers in cloud computing arrangements to be deferred over the
   noncancelable term of the cloud-computing arrangements plus any
   optional renewal periods (1) that are reasonably certain to be
   exercised by the customer or (2) for which exercise of the renewal
   option is controlled by the cloud service provider. The effective date
   of this pronouncement for public entities is for fiscal years beginning
   after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
   For all other entities, including emerging growth companies, the
   standard is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2020, and
   interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15,
   2021. Early adoption is permitted. The standard can be adopted either
   using the prospective or retrospective transition approach. The Company
   early adopted ASU 2018-15 using the prospective approach as of January
   1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact
   on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

   Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

   ASU 2016-02

   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02
   requires a lessee to separate the lease components from the non-lease
   components in a contract and recognize in the statement of financial
   position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a
   right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset
   for the lease term. For public entities, this standard is effective for
   annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including
   interim periods within that reporting period. For all other entities,
   including emerging growth companies, this standard is effective for
   annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim
   periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The
   Company early adopted ASU 2016-02 using the modified retrospective
   approach as of July 1, 2019. Based upon the Companys lease portfolio
   and evaluation of the standard, the Company estimates the adoption will
   result in the addition of $400 million to $500 million of
   right-of-use-assets and liabilities to the consolidated balance sheet,
   with no significant change to the consolidated statements of operations
   or cash flows. Additionally, the Company estimates an approximate $147
   million decrease in assets and liabilities due to the de-recognition of
   the build-to-suit asset and liability.

   ASU 2017-04

   In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and
   Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the
   subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the
   goodwill impairment test. The standard is effective for public entities
   for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in annual reporting
   years beginning after December 15, 2019. For all other entities,
   including emerging growth companies, the standard is effective for
   annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in annual reporting
   years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption of this
   standard is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of
   ASU 2017-04 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
   statements.

   3. Revenue

   The Companys primary source of revenue is from sales of its Connected
   Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue.

   The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:


     

   identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer


     

   identification of the performance obligations in the contract


     

   determination of the transaction price


     

   allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in
   the contract


     

   recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance
   obligation

   Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is
   transferred to the Companys customers, in an amount that reflects the
   consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for
   those goods or services. The Companys revenue is reported net of sales
   returns and discounts, which to date have not been material to the
   Companys financial statements. The Company estimates its liability for
   product returns based on historical return trends by product category
   and seasonality and an evaluation of current economic and market
   conditions and records the expected customer refund liability as a
   reduction to revenue, and the expected inventory right of recovery as a
   reduction of cost of revenue. If actual return costs differ from
   previous estimates, the amount of the liability and corresponding
   revenue are adjusted in the period in which such costs occur.

   Some of the Companys contracts with customers contain multiple
   performance obligations. For customer contracts that include multiple
   performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual
   performance obligations if they are distinct. The transaction price is
   then allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone
   selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling
   price based on prices charged to customers.

   Connected Fitness Products

   Connected Fitness Products include the Companys Bike and Tread,
   related accessories, associated fees for delivery and installation, and
   extended warranty agreements. The Company recognizes Connected Fitness
   Product revenue net of sales returns and discounts when the product has
   been delivered to the customer. The Company generally allows customers
   to return products within thirty days of purchase, as stated in its
   return policy.

   The Company records fees paid to third-party financing partners in
   connection with its consumer financing program as a reduction of
   revenue, as it considers such costs to be a customer sales incentive.
   The Company records payment processing fees for its credit card sales
   for Connected Fitness Products within selling and marketing expenses.

   Subscription

   The Companys subscriptions provide unlimited access to content in its
   library of live and on-demand fitness classes. The Companys
   subscriptions are offered on a month-to-month basis.

   Historically, the Company offered a prepaid subscription option where
   Subscribers earned one free month or three free months of subscription
   with the purchase of a 12-month subscription or 24-month subscription,
   respectively. The Company also offered Subscribers the ability to
   finance the prepaid subscription with the purchase of a Connected
   Fitness Product as part of its financing program. The associated
   financing fees were paid to the Companys third-party partner at the
   outset of the arrangement and are recorded as a reduction to
   subscription revenue. The Company terminated both programs in July
   2018.

   Amounts paid for subscription fees are included within customer
   deposits and deferred revenue and recognized ratably on a
   month-to-month basis.

   The Company generates a small portion of its revenue from the sale of
   studio credits to attend and participate in a live, instructor-led
   class at its New York City studios. Studio revenue is recognized at the
   time the credits are redeemed and used.

   Product Warranty

   The Company offers a standard product warranty that its Connected
   Fitness Products will operate under normal, non-commercial use for a
   period of one-year from the date of original delivery. The Company has
   the obligation, at its option, to either repair or replace the
   defective product. At the time revenue is recognized, an estimate of
   future warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenue.
   Factors that affect the warranty obligation include historical as well
   as current product failure rates, service delivery costs incurred in
   correcting product failures, and warranty policies. The Companys
   products are manufactured by contract manufacturers, and in certain
   cases, the Company may have recourse to such contract manufacturers.

   The Company also offers the option for customers in some markets to
   purchase a third-party extended warranty and service contract that
   extends or enhances the technical support, parts, and labor coverage
   offered as part of the base warranty included with the Connected
   Fitness Product for an additional period of 12 to 27 months.

   Revenue and related fees paid to the third-party provider are
   recognized on a gross basis as the Company has a continuing obligation
   to perform over the service period. Extended warranty revenue is
   recognized ratably over the extended warranty coverage period and is
   included in Connected Fitness Products revenue in the consolidated
   statement of operations.

   Disaggregation of Revenue

   The Companys revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by
   major product lines, excluding sales-based taxes, are included in Note
   17, Segment Information.

   The Companys revenue disaggregated by geographic region, based on
   ship-to address, were as follows:

   Customer Deposits and Deferred Revenue

   Deferred revenue is recorded for nonrefundable cash payments received
   for the Companys performance obligation to transfer, or stand ready to
   transfer, goods or services in the future. Deferred revenue consists of
   subscription fees billed that have not been recognized. Customer
   deposits represent payments received in advance before the Company
   transfers a good or service to the customer and are refundable.

   As of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019, customer deposits of $85.6
   million and $81.3 million, and deferred revenue of $2.9 million and
   $9.5 million, respectively, were included in customer deposits and
   deferred revenue on the Companys consolidated balance sheet.

   6. Acquisition

   Neurotic Media Acquisition

   On June 6, 2018, the Company acquired Neurotic Media, LLC (Neurotic),
   a Georgia limited liability company, for a purchase price of
   approximately $28.8 million net of cash acquired, which was paid in
   cash. Upon completion of the merger agreement, Neurotic became a wholly
   owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company acquired Neurotic
   primarily to automate and streamline content rights management on its
   platform, and to enhance Member engagement through new music features.
   The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. Of the
   total purchase consideration, $4.3 million has been recorded to
   goodwill, $24.8 million to acquired developed technology, and
   $0.1 million to tangible net assets. Included within the purchase price
   and goodwill is $0.1 million in working capital adjustments identified
   during the measurement period subsequent to the acquisition.

   The goodwill of $4.3 million represents the future economic benefits
   expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not
   qualify for separate recognition, including an experienced workforce
   and expected future synergies. The Company allocated the goodwill to
   its Subscription reporting segment.

   The results of operations for the acquisition have been included in the
   consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date.
   Actual and pro forma revenue and results of operations for the
   acquisition have not been presented because they do not have a material
   impact to the Companys consolidated revenue and results of operations,
   either individually or in aggregate.

   10. Debt and Financing Arrangements

   2015 Debt Financing Facility

   In June 2015, the Company entered into a $3.0 million senior secured
   term loan facility (as amended from time to time, the Term Loan
   Agreement) with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), maturing on June 1, 2019.
   The term loan was repayable in 36 scheduled installments commencing on
   July 1, 2016. Principal outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement
   accrued interest, payable monthly, at a floating rate per annum equal
   to the prime rate plus 1.50%.

   In June 2015, the Company entered into a three-year, $32.0 million
   secured revolving credit facility with SVB (as amended from time to
   time, the 2015 Credit Agreement). The amount that could be borrowed
   under the 2015 Credit Agreement was based upon a borrowing base formula
   with respect to the Companys trailing three-month revenue and
   outstanding liability balances. Borrowed funds accrued interest at a
   floating rate per annum equal to the prime rate plus 0.25%. Amounts
   owed under the Term Loan Agreement and 2015 Credit Agreement
   (collectively, the SVB Debt Facility) were guaranteed by the Company.
   The Company also granted security interests in substantially all of its
   assets to collateralize these obligations.

   The Company had the option to repay its borrowings under the SVB Debt
   Facility without penalty prior to maturity. As of June 30, 2017, there
   was $2.0 million of principal outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement
   of the SVB Debt Facility. In November 2017, the Company terminated the
   SVB Debt Facility and repaid the remaining $1.6 million principal
   outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement as of that date. The Company
   recognized a loss of approximately $0.1 million in November 2017
   related to the write-off of the unamortized balance of loan fees on the
   SVB Debt Facility.

   2018 Revolving Credit Facility

   In November 2017, the Company entered into a four-year, $100.0 million
   secured revolving credit facility (the 2018 Credit Agreement) with
   JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which serves as administrative agent, Bank
   of America, N.A., Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, and SVB, as joint
   syndication agents, which replaced the SVB Credit Facility. Interest on
   the 2018 Credit Agreement was paid based on LIBOR plus a predetermined
   margin or base rate. The Company was required to pay a commitment fee
   of 0.375% based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility.

   In connection with the execution of the 2018 Credit Agreement, the
   Company incurred debt issuance costs of $1.2 million during the fiscal
   year ended June 30, 2018, which are capitalized and were being
   amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over
   the term of the 2018 Credit Agreement.

   Amended and Restated Credit Agreement

   In June 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated
   revolving credit agreement (Amended Credit Agreement) with JPMorgan
   Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, lead arranger and bookrunner
   and Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending
   Partners LLC and SVB, as joint syndication agents, which amended and
   restated the 2018 Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement
   provides for a $250.0 million secured revolving credit facility,
   including up to the lesser of $150.0 million and the aggregate unused
   amount of the facility for the issuance of

   letters of credit. Interest on the Amended Credit Agreement is paid
   based on LIBOR plus 2.75% or an Alternative Base Rate plus 1.75%. The
   Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.375% on a
   quarterly basis based on the unused portion of the revolving credit
   facility.

   The Company incurred total commitment fees of $0.2 million and $0.3
   million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2019,
   respectively, which are included in interest expense in the statements
   of operations.

   The principal amount, if any, is payable in full in June 2024. As of
   June 30, 2019, the Company had not drawn on the credit facility and did
   not have outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement.

   In connection with the execution of the Amended Credit Agreement, the
   Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.9 million during the fiscal
   year ended June 30, 2019, which are being capitalized and are being
   amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over
   the term of the Amended Credit Agreement. The remaining unamortized
   deferred financing fees of $0.7 million related to the 2018 Credit
   Agreement were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense
   using the effective interest method over the term of the Amended Credit
   Agreement.

   The Company has the option to repay its borrowings under the Amended
   Credit Agreement without premium or penalty prior to maturity. The
   Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, such
   as financial statement reporting requirements and delivery of borrowing
   base certificates, as well as customary covenants that restrict its
   ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell
   certain assets, guarantee obligations of third parties, declare cash
   dividends in the entirety or make certain other distributions, and
   undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other transactions. The
   Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain financial condition
   covenants, including maintaining a total level of liquidity of not less
   than $125.0 million and maintaining certain minimum total revenue
   ranging from $725.0 million to $1,985.0 million depending on the
   applicable date of determination. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was
   in compliance with the covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. At
   June 30, 2019, the Company was contingently liable for approximately
   $40.1 million in standby letters of credit as security for its
   operating lease and inventory purchasing obligations.

   11. Commitments and Contingencies

   Lease Obligations

   The Company leases facilities under operating leases with various
   expiration dates through 2039. The Companys corporate headquarters is
   located in New York, New York. The Company also leases space for the
   operation of its production studio facilities, retail showrooms,
   microstores, warehouses, and office spaces.

   Certain of the Companys lease agreements contain renewal options, rent
   escalation clauses, rent holidays or landlord incentives. Landlord
   incentives are capitalized within deferred rent and amortized as a
   reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease. Rent expense for
   non-cancellable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or
   landlord incentives is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
   lease term, including any applicable rent holidays, beginning on the
   date of initial possession, which is generally the date when the
   Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation
   for intended use. The excess of straight-line rent expense over the
   scheduled payment amounts and landlord incentives is recorded as a
   deferred rent obligation. The Company has the option to extend or renew
   most of its leases, which may increase the future minimum lease
   commitments. The Companys lease agreements for its retail showrooms
   generally provide for a fixed minimum rental plus contingent rent,
   which is determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of
   specified levels.

   Rent expense under existing operating lease agreements was
   $8.0 million, $15.1 million, and $35.8 million for the fiscal years
   ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.

   In November 2015, the Company entered into a 10-year operating lease
   agreement for its current headquarters office space at 125 West 25th
   Street, New York, New York (the 25th Street Lease). The 25th Street
   Lease commenced in November 2016, upon the date the Company took
   possession of the leased space, although cash payments for rental
   obligations under the lease did not begin until May 2017.

   In December 2017, the Company entered into a 21-year operating lease
   agreement for a New York office and retail space at 5 Manhattan West
   (the 5 Manhattan West Lease). The 5 Manhattan West Lease commenced in
   October 2018, upon the date the Company took possession of the leased
   space and the Company is committed to $99.5 million in minimum fixed
   payments over the term of the lease although cash payments for rental
   obligations under the lease do not begin until October 2019. The 5
   Manhattan West Lease contains a renewal option for two additional
   five-year periods. The 5 Manhattan West Lease includes a tenant
   improvement allowance in the future amounting to $3.0 million. This
   allowance will be reflected as a reduction in rent expense over the
   life of the lease on a straight-line basis in the consolidated
   statements of operations and as a leasehold improvement and other
   liability in the consolidated balance sheets.

   In November 2018, the Company entered into a 16-year operating lease
   agreement for space to be used as its new corporate headquarters. The
   lease is expected to commence in August 2019, upon the date the Company
   takes possession of the leased space and commits the Company to $503.0
   million in minimum fixed payments over the term of the lease. The lease
   contains a renewal option for an additional 10-year period and includes
   a tenant improvement allowance amounting to $28.0 million. As a result
   of the Companys involvement during the construction period, whereby it
   has certain indemnification obligations related to the construction,
   the Company is considered, for accounting purposes only, the owner of
   the construction project under build-to-suit lease accounting.

   Commitments

   The Company is subject to minimum guarantee royalty payments associated
   under certain music license agreements.

   Sales and Use Taxes

   The Company has recorded an estimate of $5.7 million and $4.1 million
   as of June 30, 2018 and 2019, respectively, for the potential sales tax
   liability associated with its subscription fees, which is included in
   accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
   Company continues to analyze possible sales tax exposure but does not
   currently believe that any individual claim or aggregate claims that
   might arise will ultimately have a material effect on its results of
   operations, financial position or cash flows.

   Content Costs for Past Use Reserve

   To secure the rights to stream music on the Peloton platform, the
   Company must obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, copyright
   owners of both sound recordings and musical compositions. During the
   fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, the Company has
   entered into negotiations with various music rights holders, to pay for
   any and all uses of musical compositions and sound recordings to-date
   and, at the same time, enter into go-forward license agreements for the
   use of music in the future.

   Prior to the execution of go-forward music license agreements, the
   Company estimates and records expenses inclusive of estimated content
   costs for past use (refer to Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting
   PoliciesMusic Royalty Fees) as well as normal and recurring music
   royalty expenses. The Company recorded content costs for past use of
   $15.5 million, $14.5 million, and $16.4 million during the fiscal years
   ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. In addition, the
   Company recorded estimates for normal and recurring royalty expense of
   $0.4 million, $1.0 million, and $2.8 million during the fiscal years
   ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The Company includes
   both of these components in its reserve. As of 2018, and 2019, the
   Company has recorded reserves of $18.6 million and $18.9 million,
   respectively, included in accrued expenses in the accompanying
   consolidated balance sheets.

   Legal Proceedings

   On March 19, 2019, Downtown Music Publishing LLC, ole Media Management,
   L.P., Big Deal Music, LLC, CYPMP, LLC, Peer International Corporation,
   PSO Limited, Peermusic Ltd., Peermusic III, Ltd., Peertunes, Ltd.,
   Songs of Peer Ltd., Reservoir Media Management, Inc., The Richmond
   Organization, Inc., Round Hill Music LLC, The Royalty Network, Inc.,
   and Ultra International Music Publishing, LLC filed a lawsuit against
   the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
   York, captioned Downtown Music Publg LLC, et. al v. Peloton
   Interactive, Inc., alleging that the Company engaged in copyright
   infringement by using certain accused songs in streaming and recorded
   fitness classes without necessary licenses. The plaintiffs allege that
   they are music publishers that own or control the copyrights in
   numerous musical works that were synchronized by the Company without
   the plaintiffs authorization. The complaint asserts a single claim for
   copyright infringement. It seeks injunctive relief, up to $150 million
   in damages, and attorneys fees and costs. The Company intends to
   vigorously defend the claim.

   On April 30, 2019, the Company answered the complaint and filed
   counterclaims against the original named plaintiffs and National Music
   Publishers Association, Inc., a trade association, alleging that they
   coordinated to collectively negotiate licenses in violation of the
   antitrust laws. The counterclaims also assert that the trade
   association tortuously interfered with the Companys attempts to engage
   in direct negotiations with music publishers in violation of state law.
   The counterclaims seek injunctive relief, monetary damages (to be
   trebled under applicable statute), and attorneys fees and costs. An
   initial pretrial conference was held on May 9, 2019 and discovery has
   commenced. An amended complaint filed on May 31, 2019 named additional
   plaintiffs Greensleeves Publishing Ltd., Me Gusta Music, LLC, Raleigh
   Music Publishing LLC, STB Music, Inc., and TuneCore, Inc. and
   identified additional musical works. The Company answered the amended
   complaint on June 14, 2019. On June 24, 2019, counter-defendants filed
   a motion to dismiss the counterclaims, to which the Company filed an
   opposition on August 8, 2019. Discovery on the claims and counterclaims
   is ongoing in the case.

   While the Company cannot predict what the ultimate result of any
   judgment against, or settlement by, the Company, will be in this
   matter, based on application of ASC 450, Contingencies, at June 30,
   2019, the Company has accrued its best estimate within a range of
   reasonably possible outcomes ranging from $4.0 million to $11.0
   million, which is included in

   accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
   Amounts accrued for this matter at June 30, 2019 are not considered
   material to the Companys financial position and the Company continues
   to vigorously defend its position in the aforementioned outstanding
   matter and assess its legal position.

   In addition to the above, from time to time, the Company is subject to
   litigation matters and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its
   business. The Company believes that the outcome of any existing
   litigation, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a
   material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or
   cash flows of the Company.

   12. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders Equity

   Stock Split

   In August 2018, the Company effected a 4-for-1 stock split on its
   shares of common stock. Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and
   share information included in the financial statements and notes
   thereto have been retroactively adjusted for the stock split as if such
   stock split occurred on the first day of the first period presented.

   Common Stock

   In connection with the conversion to a corporation in April 2015, the
   Company authorized common stock with a par value of $0.000025 per
   share. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, there were 266,946,216 and
   400,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, respectively, and
   25,936,848 and 25,301,604 shares of common stock outstanding,
   respectively.

   Warrant Transactions

   In June 2015, the Company issued 240,000 common stock warrants in
   connection with the Term Loan Agreement with SVB (see Note 10). The
   warrants were initially recorded at their fair value calculated using
   the Black-Scholes model, with the following weighted-average
   assumptions: exercise price of $0.19 per share, price of $0.19 per
   share, expected term of 10 years, risk-free rate of 2.35%, and
   volatility of 90%. The fair value of the warrants of $38,000 was
   recorded as deferred financing costs and such costs were amortized to
   interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of
   the loan. In connection with the termination of the SVB Debt Facility
   in November 2017, the Company recognized the remaining balance of
   unamortized deferred financing costs, including the amount related to
   the warrants, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (see Note 10).

   Preferred Stock

   As of June 30, 2019, the Companys fifth amended and restated
   certificate of incorporation authorized the issuance of up to
   215,443,468 shares of Preferred Stock, designated as follows:
   10,617,908 shares as Series A Preferred Stock, 25,799,744 as Series B
   Preferred Stock, 48,246,732 as Series C Preferred Stock, 31,635,604 as
   Series D Preferred Stock, and 60,013,480 as Series E Preferred Stock,
   and 39,130,000 as Series F Preferred Stock.

   Series E Financing & Tender Offer

   In March 2017, the Company filed its third amended and restated
   certificate of incorporation, which authorized the issuance of
   60,013,480 shares Series E Preferred Stock with rights and preferences,
   including voting rights, as determined from time to time by the Board
   of Directors. In May 2017, the Company filed an amendment to the
   certificate of incorporation which decreased the authorized number of
   shares of common stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
   Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock, to a total of 266,946,216 shares,
   27,169,432 shares, 49,375,076 shares, and 31,635,604 shares,
   respectively.

   In March 2017, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement
   with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which it sold and issued
   40,624,492 shares of its newly created Series E Preferred Stock at a
   purchase price of approximately $5.42 per share (the Series E Share
   Price) in an initial closing. Between April 1, 2017 and May 31, 2017,

   Company sold and issued an additional 19,388,988 shares of Series E
   Preferred Stock in a series of subsequent closings (combined, the
   Series E Financing). The aggregate gross proceeds from the Series E
   Financing were approximately $325.0 million. The Company incurred
   issuance costs of $9.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30,
   2017 in connection with the Series E Financing, which are recorded as a
   reduction of the Series E Preferred Stock share balance.

   In connection with closing of the Series E Financing, the Company used
   approximately $175.0 million of the proceeds from the Series E
   Financing to repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock and
   Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock from certain
   existing stockholders at the Series E Share Price. The repurchase
   occurred through a series of share repurchase transactions in
   conjunction with the initial and subsequent closings of the Series E
   Financing, in addition to a tender offer made by the Company following
   the closing of the Series E Financing (the 2017 Tender Offer). The
   2017 Tender Offer was made to certain existing equity holders of the
   Company to repurchase shares of the Companys capital stock and options
   to purchase such shares of capital stock from such equity holders at a
   gross repurchase price equal to the Series E Share Price. The aggregate
   gross repurchase amounts under the Series E Financing closings and the
   2017 Tender Offer were $122.7 million and $52.3 million, respectively.
   In connection therewith, the Company repurchased 9,717,464 shares of
   common stock, 2,381,576 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 1,504,660
   shares of Series B Preferred Stock, 5,290,300 shares of Series C
   Preferred Stock, and 13,420,940 shares of Series D Preferred Stock each
   at the Series E Share Price. The repurchased shares were retired and
   considered authorized, but not issued or outstanding, pursuant to the
   Companys third amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The
   repurchase price of the redeemable convertible preferred stock,
   including closing costs, of $118.7 million exceeded the carrying value
   of $26.4 million at the date of repurchase. For the computation of net
   loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year
   ended June 30, 2017, the repurchase price in excess of the then
   carrying value of the Preferred Stock of $92.3 million was recorded as
   a reduction to net loss in computing net loss attributable to common
   stockholders.

   In accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, the Company recorded
   stock-based compensation expense of $8.3 million in the fiscal year
   ended June 30, 2017, which represents the excess of the tender offer
   repurchase price over the fair value of the shares repurchased which
   were held by employees and is included within general and
   administrative operating expenses in the consolidated statements of
   operations. For shares sold by stockholders who were not employees, the
   Company recorded the excess of the tender offer repurchase price over
   the fair value of the shares repurchased as a reduction to retained
   earnings. The Company recorded a reduction in redeemable convertible
   preferred stock and stockholders equity, net of closing costs, of
   $161.6 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 for the share
   repurchase transaction.

   In connection with the share repurchase transactions, the Company
   incurred transaction costs of $4.4 million directly related to the
   share repurchase, which are recorded as a reduction in stockholders
   equity as of June 30, 2017.

   Series F Financing and Tender Offer

   On August 29, 2018, the Company filed its fourth amended and restated
   certificate of incorporation, which authorized the issuance of
   39,130,000 shares Series F Preferred Stock with rights and preferences,
   including voting rights, as determined from time to time by the Board
   of Directors.

   In August 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase
   agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which it sold
   and issued 38,088,200 shares of its newly created Series F Preferred
   Stock (the Series F Financing) at a purchase price of $14.44018 per
   share (the Series F Share Price). The aggregate gross proceeds from
   the Series F Financing were approximately $550.0 million. The Company
   incurred issuance costs of $10.9 million during the fiscal year ended
   June 30, 2019 in connection with the Series F Financing, which were
   recorded as a reduction of the Series F Preferred Stock share balance.

   In connection with the closing of the Series F Financing, the Company
   used approximately $130.0 million of the proceeds from the Series F
   Financing to repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock and
   Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series E Preferred Stock from certain
   existing stockholders at the Series F Share Price. The repurchase
   occurred through a tender offer made by the Company following the
   closing of the Series F Financing (the 2018 Tender Offer). The 2018

   Tender Offer was made to certain existing equity holders of the Company
   to repurchase shares of the Companys capital stock and options to
   purchase such shares of capital stock from such equity holders at a

   therewith, the Company repurchased 5,503,479 shares of common stock,
   1,091,444 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 1,100,257 shares of
   Series B Preferred Stock, 998,368 shares of Series C Preferred Stock,

   Share Price. The repurchased shares were retired and considered
   authorized, but not issued or outstanding, pursuant to the Companys
   fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The
   repurchase price of the redeemable convertible preferred stock,
   including closing costs, of $54.4 million exceeded the carrying value
   of $4.3 million at the date of repurchase. For the computation of net
   loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year
   ended June 30, 2019, the repurchase price in excess of the then
   carrying value of the Preferred Stock of $50.1 million was recorded as
   a reduction to net loss in computing net loss attributable to common
   stockholders.

   In accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, the Company recorded
   stock-based compensation expense of $28.2 million in the fiscal year
   ended June 30, 2019, which represents the excess of the tender offer
   repurchase price over the fair value of the shares repurchased which
   were held by employees and is included within operating expenses in the

   employees, the Company recorded the excess of the tender offer
   repurchase price over the fair value of the shares repurchased as a
   reduction to retained earnings. The Company recorded a reduction in
   redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity, on a
   gross basis, of $104.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30,
   2019 for the share repurchase transaction.

   In connection with the share repurchase transactions, the Company
   incurred transaction costs of $2.7 million directly related to the
   share repurchase, which are recorded as a reduction in stockholders
   deficit as of June 30, 2019.

   Pursuant to ASC 718-10-25-15, the Company reflects the substantive
   terms of its employee share-based payments in accounting for the
   arrangements. With the 2018 Tender Offer, the Company believes that it
   has established a pattern of cash settlement of immature shares and
   stock options only during a very discrete set of circumstances in which
   the Company opens a tender offer in conjunction with preferred stock
   financing. As such, during the 2018 Tender Offer period, the Company
   recorded a liability equal to the fair value of the maximum number of
   options representing immature shares that could have been redeemed in
   the tender offer. To the extent that this liability exceeded amounts
   previously recognized in equity, the excess was recognized as
   additional stock-based compensation expense. Following the closing of
   the 2018 Tender Offer, the remaining liability after the repurchase of
   tendered shares was reclassified to stockholders equity. The Company
   recorded stock-based compensation expense of $33.5 million associated
   with this tender offer.

   Dividends

   The holders of shares of preferred stock, in preference to the holders
   of common stock, are entitled to receive dividends upon declaration by
   the Board of Directors. Such dividends are non-cumulative and are
   payable at a per annum rate of eight percent of the original share
   issue price. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, no dividends have been
   declared or distributed to any stockholders.

   Conversion

   Each share of preferred stock is convertible, at any time, at its
   holders discretion, into one fully paid and non-assessable share of
   common stock. The conversion rate shall be adjusted whenever the
   Company shall issue or sell, or is deemed to have issued or sold, any
   shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the
   conversion price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue
   or sale.

   The Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
   Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock shall be automatically
   converted into common stock upon the consummation of a qualified
   initial public offering at a public offering price of not less than
   $30.0 million in the aggregate. The Series E Preferred Stock and Series
   F Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into common stock
   upon the consummation of an initial public offering at a public
   offering price of not less than $75.0 million in the aggregate. In
   addition, at any time prior to consummation of an initial public
   offering,

   (1) all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
   Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock shall be automatically
   converted into common stock upon the affirmative election of holders of
   a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock,
   Series B Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock, voting together
   as a single class on an as-converted to common stock basis; (2) all of

   55% of the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock. Upon any
   such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be
   paid.

   Liquidation Preferences

   In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
   Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Series B
   Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock,
   Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F Preferred Stock, in preference
   to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and common stock, shall be
   entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company that are legally
   available for distribution, an amount equal to the applicable original
   issue price per share, for each share of Preferred Stock held by them,
   plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares. In the event
   that the assets available for distribution are not sufficient to pay
   the full preferential amounts, the assets will be distributed pro rata
   among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
   Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F
   Preferred Stock, in proportion to the full preferential amount that
   each such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive. The aggregate
   preferential amount for Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
   Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, and Series E Preferred Stock, and
   Series F Preferred Stock was $413.6 million and $959.5 million as of
   June 30, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

   After payment of the full liquidation preference of the Series B
   Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock,
   Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F Preferred Stock, before any
   distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of common stock,
   the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid
   out of the remaining assets of the Company legally available for
   distribution, if any, in an amount equal to the applicable original
   issue price per share, for each share of Preferred Stock held by them,
   plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.
   In the event that the assets available for distribution are not
   sufficient to pay the full such preferential amount, the available
   assets shall be distributed pro rata among the holders of Series A
   Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount that each
   such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive. The aggregate
   preferential amount for the Series A Preferred Stock was $2.7 million
   and $2.4 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2019.

   After payment of the liquidation preferences to the holders of the
   Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
   Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, and Series E Preferred Stock, and
   Series F Preferred Stock, the entire remaining assets and funds of the
   Company legally available for distribution, if any, shall be
   distributed ratably to the holders of common stock.

   Voting

   The holder of each share of preferred stock is entitled to one vote for
   each share of common stock into which such preferred stock is
   convertible at the time of the vote. With respect to such vote, such
   holder has full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights of
   the holders of common stock.

   For so long as any shares of preferred stock remain outstanding, the
   vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
   preferred stock shall be required for effecting or validating certain
   actions, including: (1) consummation of a liquidation event or any
   other merger or consolidation; (2) any amendment, alteration, or repeal
   of the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the Company;
   (3) any increase or decrease in the authorized number of shares of
   common stock or preferred stock or any series thereof; (4) any
   authorization or designation, whether by reclassification or otherwise,
   of a new class or series of stock that is not junior to the existing
   series of preferred stock with respect to dividends,

   13. Equity-Based Compensation

   2015 Stock Plan

   In April 2015, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of the
   2015 Stock Plan (2015 Plan) to provide stock award grants to
   employees, directors, and consultants of the Company. The Board of
   Directors, or at its sole discretion, a committee of the Board of
   Directors, is responsible for the administration of the 2015 Plan. As
   of June 30, 2019, the Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of
   up to 85,725,084 shares of common stock for stock award grants,
   including incentive and non-statutory stock options.

   The 2015 Plan requires that the per share exercise price of each stock
   option shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the
   common stock subject to the stock option on the grant date. Stock
   option grants shall not be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years
   from the date of its grant or such shorter period as specified in a
   stock award agreement. For

   initial grants, vesting generally occurs over four years with the first
   25% of the award vesting upon the 12-month anniversary of the vesting
   commencement date and the remaining 75% vesting monthly over the
   following 36 months. The 2015 Plan provides that the Board of Directors
   may, in its sole discretion, impose such limitations on transferability
   of stock options as the Board of Directors shall determine. In the
   absence of a determination by the Board of Directors to the contrary,
   stock options shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws
   of descent and distribution and domestic relations orders, unless
   specifically agreed to by the plan administrator.

   The 2015 Plan allows for the early exercise of stock options. Shares
   purchased pursuant to the early exercise of stock options are subject
   to repurchase until those shares vest; therefore, cash received in
   exchange for unvested shares exercised is recorded as a liability on
   the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and are reclassified to
   common stock and additional paid-in capital as the shares vest.

   During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the Company granted options
   to purchase 4,274,000 shares under the 2015 Plan, consisting of
   1,805,552 shares subject to incentive stock options and 2,468,448
   shares subject to non-statutory stock options. During the fiscal year
   ended June 30, 2018, the Company granted options to purchase 23,847,756
   shares under the 2015 Plan, consisting of 5,268,903 shares subject to
   incentive stock options and 18,578,853 shares subject to non-statutory
   stock options. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company
   granted options to purchase 32,108,062 shares under the 2015 Plan,
   consisting of 5,594,291 shares subject to incentive stock options and
   26,513,771 subject to non-statutory stock options.

   weighted-average grant date fair value per option was $0.53, $1.67, and
   $6.71, respectively. The fair value of each option was estimated at the
   grant date using the Black-Scholes method with the following
   assumptions:


                            Fiscal Year Ended June 30,
                        2017             2018             2019

   (1)

   Based on U.S. Treasury seven-year constant maturity interest rate whose
   term is consistent with the expected term of the option.
   (2)

   Expected volatility is based on an analysis of comparable public
   company volatilities and adjusted for the Companys stage of
   development.

   With respect to the 2015 Plan, the Company recognized stock
   compensation expense of $1.9 million, $8.5 million, and $28.5 million
   for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.
   As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $217.2 million of unrecognized
   stock-based compensation expense that is expected to be recognized over
   a weighted-average period of 3.9 years.

   14. Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers and Vendors

   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
   significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
   and cash equivalents. The Companys cash and cash equivalents are
   maintained with high-quality financial institutions, the compositions
   and maturities of which are regularly monitored by management.

   For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, there were no
   customers representing greater than 10% of the Companys total revenue.

   The Companys top three vendors accounted for approximately 94% and 91%
   of total finished goods purchases for the fiscal years ended June 30,
   2017 and 2018, respectively.

   The Companys top four vendors accounted for approximately 91% of total
   finished goods purchases for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.

   15. Income Taxes

   The Companys provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended
   June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019 was zero, $0.1 million, and $0.1 million,
   respectively. The tax income provision consists of the Texas state
   franchise tax and international income taxes.

   A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the
   effective income tax rate is as follows:


                            Fiscal Year Ended June 30,

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Companys
   effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 are due to
   the change in valuation allowance and permanent differences related to
   stock compensation. The primary differences from the U.S. statutory
   rate and the Companys effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended
   June 30, 2018 are due to the rate change on deferred tax assets as a
   result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Act), partially
   offset by state and local taxes and federal tax credits. The primary
   differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Companys effective
   tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 are due to the change
   in valuation allowance, partially offset by state and local taxes.

   On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law making significant
   changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal
   Revenue Code). Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal
   corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning
   after December 31, 2017, a one-time transition tax on the mandatory
   deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, and numerous domestic and
   international-related provisions effective in 2018. The Company has
   estimated its provision for income taxes specifically related to the
   reduction of the federal corporate tax rate in accordance with the Act
   and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result
   has recorded $18.0 million of income tax expense, which was offset by a
   corresponding adjustment for the same amount to the Companys valuation
   allowance, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.

   On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) was
   issued to address the application of GAAP in situations when a
   registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared,
   or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete
   the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. For the
   fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded $18.0 million of
   the income tax expense in connection with the re-measurement of certain
   deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of June 30, 2019, the Company
   has completed the accounting for all the impacts of the Act with no
   material changes to the provisional estimate recorded in the prior
   period.

   As of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019, the Companys deferred tax
   assets were primarily the result of U.S. federal and state net
   operating losses (NOLs), deferred revenue, research and development
   tax credits, non-qualified stock options, and accrued litigation
   reserves. A valuation allowance was maintained on substantially all
   worldwide gross deferred tax asset balances as of June 30, 2018 and
   2019. As of each reporting date, the Companys management considers new
   evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact managements
   view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. The
   recognition of deferred tax assets was based on the evaluation of
   current and estimated future profitability of the operations, reversal
   of deferred tax liabilities and the likelihood of utilizing tax credit
   and/or loss carryforwards. As of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019, the
   Company continued to maintain that it is not more likely than not that
   its deferred taxes will be realized in the United States and United
   Kingdom due to managements expectation of continued tax losses for the
   foreseeable future.

   Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
   differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
   financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
   purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets

   As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Company had federal NOLs of
   approximately $110.0 million and $112.6 million, respectively, of which
   $59.3 million will begin to expire in 2036 and the remainder will be
   carried forward indefinitely. The Company has undergone two ownership
   changes on November 30, 2015 and April 18, 2017 and its NOLs are
   subject to a Section 382 limitation. The total NOLs subject to a 382
   limitation are $72,338 as of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019. The
   resulting Section 382 limitations are large enough to avail the Section
   382 limited NOLs by June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the
   Company had state NOLs of approximately $94.0 million and $95.8
   million, respectively, which will begin to expire at various dates
   beginning in 2021 if not utilized. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the
   Company had foreign NOLs of zero and approximately $26.7 million,
   respectively, generated from its operations in the United Kingdom,
   which will be carried forward indefinitely. As of June 30, 2018 and
   2019, the Company had $2.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively, of
   U.S. research and development credit carryovers that will begin to
   expire in 2036.

   As of June 30, 2019, the Company did not have material undistributed
   foreign earnings. The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability
   for foreign withholding or other foreign local tax on the undistributed
   earnings from the Companys international subsidiaries as such earnings
   are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

   The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a
   recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial
   statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or
   expected to be taken in a tax return. For benefits to be recognized, a
   tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon
   examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized is
   measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50%
   likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement. As of
   June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Company has not recognized any uncertain
   tax positions.

   The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various state
   and local jurisdictions, Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The
   tax years ended June 30, 2018, February 25, 2018, February 26, 2017 and
   February 29, 2016 remain subject to examination by tax authorities.

   17. Segment Information

   The Company applies ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, in determining
   reportable segments for its financial statement disclosure. The Company
   has three reportable segments: Connected Fitness Products,
   Subscription, and Other. Segment information is presented in the same
   manner that the Companys Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM)
   reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating
   resources. The CODM reviews revenue and gross profit for each of the
   reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of
   revenue incurred by the segment. No operating segments have been
   aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company does not
   allocate assets at the reportable segment level as these are managed on
   an entity wide group basis. As of June 30, 2019, the Company did not
   have material assets located outside of the United States.

   The Connected Fitness Product segment derives revenue from sale of the
   Bike, Tread, and related accessories, and associated fees for delivery
   and installation and extended warranty agreements. The Subscription
   segment derives revenue from monthly Subscription fees as well as
   credits from live studio classes. The Other segment primarily consists
   of boutique and apparel sales. There are no internal revenue
   transactions between the Companys segments.

   Key financial performance measures of the segments including revenue,
   cost of revenue, and gross profit are as follows:

   Reconciliation of Gross Profit

   are not allocated to individual segments as these are managed on an
   entity wide group basis. The reconciliation between reportable segment
   gross profit to consolidated loss before tax is as follows:

   ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

   Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL,
   authorizes a court to award, or a corporations board of directors to
   grant, indemnity to directors and officers under certain circumstances
   and subject to certain limitations. The terms of Section 145 of the
   DGCL are sufficiently broad to permit indemnification under certain
   circumstances for liabilities, including reimbursement of expenses
   incurred, arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
   Securities Act.

   As permitted by the DGCL, the Registrants restated certificate of
   incorporation that will be in effect following the completion of this
   offering contains provisions that eliminate the personal liability of
   its directors for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties
   as a director, except liability for the following:


     

   any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Registrant or its
   stockholders;


     

   acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional
   misconduct or a knowing violation of law;


     

   under Section 174 of the DGCL (regarding unlawful dividends and stock
   purchases); or


     

   any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
   benefit.

   As permitted by the DGCL, the Registrants restated bylaws that will be
   in effect following the completion of this offering provide that:


     

   the Registrant is required to indemnify its directors and executive
   officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, subject to very
   limited exceptions;


     

   the Registrant may indemnify its other employees and agents as set
   forth in the DGCL;


     

   the Registrant is required to advance expenses, as incurred, to its
   directors and executive officers in connection with a legal proceeding
   to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, subject to very limited
   exceptions; and


     

   the rights conferred in the restated bylaws are not exclusive.


                                    II-1
   _______________________________________________________________________

Table of Contents

   Prior to this offering, the Registrant has entered into indemnification
   agreements with each of its current directors and executive officers to
   provide these directors and executive officers additional contractual
   assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in the
   Registrants restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws
   and to provide additional procedural protections. At present, there is
   no pending litigation or proceeding involving a director, executive
   officer, or employee of the Registrant regarding which indemnification
   is sought. Reference is also made to the underwriting agreement filed
   as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement, which provides for the
   indemnification of executive officers, directors, and controlling
   persons of the Registrant against certain liabilities. The
   indemnification provisions in the Registrants restated certificate of
   incorporation and restated bylaws and the indemnification agreements
   entered into or to be entered into between the Registrant and each of
   its directors and executive officers may be sufficiently broad to
   permit indemnification of the Registrants directors and executive
   officers for liabilities arising under the Securities Act.

   The Registrant has directors and officers liability insurance for its
   directors and officers.

   Certain of the Registrants directors are also indemnified by their
   employers with regard to their service on the Registrants board of
   directors.

   In addition, the underwriting agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this
   registration statement provides for indemnification by the underwriters
   of the Registrant and its officers and directors for certain
   liabilities arising under the Securities Act, or otherwise.

   ITEM 15. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES

   equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock.

   Unless otherwise stated, the sales of the above securities were deemed
   to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance
   upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act (or Regulation D or
   Regulation S promulgated thereunder), or Rule 701 promulgated under
   Section 3(b) of the Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not
   involving any public offering or pursuant to benefit plans and
   contracts relating to compensation as provided under Rule 701. The
   recipients of the securities in each of these transactions represented
   their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not
   with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof,
   and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued
   in these transactions.

   ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS

   The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the
   underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement
   certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as
   required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each
   purchaser.

   Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
   Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of
   the Registrant pursuant to provisions described in Item 14 above, or
   otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
   Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against
   public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
   unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
   such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses
   incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the
   Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)
   is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
   connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will,
   unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
   controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
   the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
   policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the
   final adjudication of such issue.

   The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that:

   (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act,
   the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of
   this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in
   a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1)
   or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of
   this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.
