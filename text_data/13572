                     Avid Blames Google for Mac Pro Crashes

   Avid confirms that the crash and failure to reboot of Mac Pros across
   Hollywood was nothing to do with its software, with the blame falling
   on a Google Chrome update.

   Mac Pro (trash can)

   UPDATE 9/25: Avid has released a statement confirming that the root
   cause of Mac Pros crashing this week was in fact a Chrome update
   released by Google. The update includes a bug that "damages the file
   system on macOS machines." Information relating to the bug can be found
   on the Google Chrome Help community website.

   Avid CEO Jeff Rosica stated, "Avid is pleased that the reboot issue
   facing some customers is solved and while Avid products are not the
   root cause, we're keeping an intense focus on bringing all of our
   customers back online and back to work. Over the past 36 hours, the
   deep dive of due diligence working closely with Apple, PACE and other
   partners exhausted all options and we've landed in the right place as
   quickly as possible. We owe our special thanks to Avid's customer and
   user community for their typically strong show of support at this time,
   especially to those who welcomed our engineers into their studios to
   troubleshoot."

   Original Story 9/24:
   The combination of a Mac Pro and Avid's Media Composer video-editing
   software is a common one across Hollywood. However, since yesterday
   it's been causing Mac Pros to slowly crash and refuse to reboot.

   As Variety reports, the movie and TV industry in Los Angeles is
   "sweating" today because the trashcan Mac Pros they rely on to work are
   failing and nobody knows why yet. The Macs are refusing to reboot, with
   the Avid Editors of Facebook group urging people not to turn off their
   Macs as the tweet below show.

     BIG ALERT tonight regarding #Apple, and #MacOS running on the can.
     DO NOT SHUT DOWN!! #AvidEditors #Avid Apparently something is
     corrupting one of the UNIX root level folders. Back up everything,
     not just on the servers is you are in a connected environment. Refer
     to below FB pg pic.twitter.com/iLlfHVRfmp
     — MarcusPun (@MarcusPun) September 24, 2019

   In a statement, Avid said it's "aware of the reboot issue affecting
   Apple Mac Pro devices running some Avid products, which arose late
   yesterday. The company also released the video included below to help
   explain the situation and offer some guidance while the problem is
   identified and solved:

   One way to test if your Mac Pro is affected is to go into System
   Preferences and then Users & Groups. If you know your account is set as
   admin, but the preferences only show you as a regular user, your system
   has been compromised and will likely fail to reboot if shut down.

   Editor's Note: This story was updated at 1:30 p.m. ET on Sept. 25 with
   details of Google Chrome bug.

     * Pros
       Top-notch scores from four labs. Best antiphishing score. Firewall
       with powerful application control. Protection for macOS and Android
       devices. Automated security patching. Webcam protection. Many bonus
       features.
     * Cons
       Hard to find some settings.
     * Bottom Line
       Kaspersky Internet Security gets top scores from the antivirus
       testing labs. It comes with everything you'd expect in a suite,
       along with plenty of extras, and its components are consistently
       effective.

   Editors' Choice

   Editors' Note: We are aware of the allegations of Kaspersky's
   inappropriate ties to the Russian government. Until we see some actual
   proof of these allegations, we will treat them as unproven, and
   continue to recommend Kaspersky's security products as long as their
   performance continues to merit our endorsement.
   Antivirus protection for all your computers is a must, especially with
   ransomware on the rise, but antivirus isn't all you need. A full-scale
   security suite offers protection on many other levels. Kaspersky
   Internet Security takes an award-winning antivirus and adds firewall,
   spam filtering, parental control, a VPN, and more. And all these
   security components do their jobs well.

   This suite lists at $79.99 per year for three licenses or $89.99 for
   five licenses. First-time users can often get a significant discount.
   You can use your licenses to protect Windows, macOS, or Android
   devices. That same $89.99 price gets you unlimited cross-platform
   licenses for McAfee Internet Security. Symantec Norton 360 Deluxe costs
   $99.99 per year for five licenses, but that also includes five
   no-limits VPN licenses. With Kaspersky, you pay $4.99 per month to
   remove the VPN's limitations.

   The program's spacious main window features a big status banner across
   the top. If there's a configuration problem it offers a link to set
   things right; if not, it may still have some recommendations. There are
   six big button panels labeled Scan, Database Update, Safe Money,
   Privacy Protection, Parental Control, and My Kaspersky. Below these is
   a button to bring up a menu of more tools, and a gear icon at bottom
   left to open Settings. I had trouble finding desired settings a few
   times, because the Protection page features 15 distinct components, in
   no order that I could determine. I'd like to see a Search box for
   settings, like you get with Norton.

   Kaspersky Internet Security Main

Features Shared With Free Protection

   This suite overlaps most security features found in Kaspersky Security
   Cloud Free, though the free product models itself on Kaspersky Security
   Cloud, not on this suite or on the commercial Kaspersky Anti-Virus.
   I'll summarize the security features shared with Kaspersky Free; you
   can read that review for full details.

   Lab Test Results Chart
   Malware Protection Results Chart
   Phishing Protection Results Chart

   All four of the independent antivirus testing labs I follow include
   Kaspersky in their regular reports. In the latest set of reports,
   Kaspersky earned the maximum possible score in every test but one.
   Bitdefender Internet Security managed the same feat. Both top the list,
   with 9.9 of 10 possible aggregate lab points.

   In the past, Kaspersky reserved the System Watcher behavioral detection
   component for paid products, but with the 2019 edition that feature has
   made it into the free antivirus. I tested this feature and found that
   it caught all my encrypting ransomware samples even with the regular
   real-time protection turned off. A simple screen-locker ransomware
   slipped past System Watcher, but I broke its hold using Kaspersky's
   dedicated lock-breaker keystroke (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F4 by default).

   Kaspersky didn't fare quite as well in my hands-on malware protection
   test, scoring 8.7 of 10 possible points. However, when my results don't
   jibe with the labs, I defer to the work of the dozens of dedicated
   researchers in the labs. Webroot detected 100 percent of these samples
   and scored 9.7 points. In a rare winning position, Windows Defender
   topped Webroot, earning 9.8 points.

   Tested with my previous sample set, Norton, G Data Internet Security,
   and Sophos all detected 97 percent. They scored 9.7, 9.5, and 9.3
   points respectively.

   When I challenged Kaspersky to protect against malware downloads from a
   hundred recently discovered malware-hosting URLs, it either blocked
   access to the URL or eliminated the download 89 percent of the time.
   That's good, but Trend Micro Internet Security and F-Secure managed 99
   percent protection.

   Kaspersky's Web Anti-Virus component proved more adept at detecting
   phishing frauds than at flagging malware-hosting URLs. It managed 100
   percent detection in my hands-on antiphishing test, tying with McAee
   for the top score. Bitdefender wasn't far behind, with 99 percent
   detection. It's worth noting that the macOS equivalents of these three
   products scored precisely the same.

   SecurityWatch

   All of Kaspersky's security products come with a free,
   bandwidth-limited edition of the Kaspersky Secure Connection VPN.
   Powered by AnchorFree Hotspot Shield Elite, the VPN lets you use 200MB
   of bandwidth per day on each device. Paying an extra $4.99 per month
   lifts the banewidth cap and lets you specify the country for your VPN
   server. Bitdefender offers a very similar deal, also powered by
   AnchorFree. Other bonus features include an on-screen keyboard to foil
   keyloggers and a markup system to flag dangerous links in search
   results.

   Clicking More Tools brings up pages of additional tools, many of which
   are not available to users of the free edition. Among the tools that
   don't require a premium purchase are a file shredder, a rescue disk,
   and several tools designed to clean and optimize your PC.

Features Shared With Premium Antivirus

   One big plus to paying for Kaspersky Anti-Virus is that you get
   full-scale tech support, via phone or live chat. Users of the free
   edition must rely on FAQs and forums.

   te=true

   Hackers find security holes and security companies patch those holes.
   If you fail to apply the patches, you can have big trouble. The
   Vulnerability Scan reports on any missing patches for Windows and
   popular applications. It also reports on configuration settings that
   are bad for security, with an option to fix those automatically.

Safe Money

   When you navigate to a banking site or other sensitive website,
   Kaspersky offers to open that site in the Safe Money protected browser.
   By default, once you've accepted that offer, it always opens that site
   in the protected browser. Bitdefender's Safepay feature works in much
   the same way.

   A green border around the browser, along with a semi-transparent
   overlay notice, reminds you that you're in this special, protected
   mode, in a browser that's isolated from other processes. It even foils
   screen-scraping spy programs. You can open the notification area icon's
   menu and choose from a list of sites you've visited with Safe Money, to
   quickly revisit any of them.

Firewall and Application Control

   The earliest personal firewalls developed a reputation for bombarding
   the user with incomprehensible queries. Brekekekex.exe wants to connect
   to IP address 200.199.198.197 using port 8080—allow, or block? Most
   users lack the knowledge to answer that question with confidence. Some
   users always click Allow. Others always click Block, until they break
   something, at which point they switch to Allow. Fear not, Kaspersky
   handles application control itself, without popping up confusing
   queries.

   Using data from the Kaspersky Security Network database, the
   application control system flags each application as Trusted, Low
   Restricted, High Restricted, or Untrusted. Untrusted apps simply don't
   get to run. Others that aren't in the Trusted category can run, but
   with limited access to sensitive system areas.

   Kaspersky Internet Security Firewall

   It's not uncommon for application installers to bundle additional
   products, items you didn't request. As part of its job, Application
   Manager automatically clears checkboxes offering additional software
   and suppresses application steps that include ads or bundled items. It
   works something like the Bundle Protection feature in Reason Core
   Security.

   Of course, a firewall also must protect your system against attack from
   the internet. To check that feature, I hit the test system with 30
   exploits generated by the CORE Impact penetration tool. Kaspersky
   detected and blocked 44 percent of the exploits. That's precisely the
   same as Bitdefender's recent score, though Kaspersky identified more of
   them using their official exploit tracking number. Even the missed
   exploits didn't breach security, since the test system has all security
   patches, but it's good to see that Kaspersky is on the alert for such
   attacks.

   The exploit detection scores by Kaspersky and Bitdefender beat most
   competitors, but Symantec Norton Security Deluxe spotted and blocked 85
   percent of the exploits, while G Data and ESET caught 68 and 55 percent
   respectively.

   Your security protection is worthless if a malicious program or script
   can turn it off. Kaspersky's self-defense proved effective when I
   attacked it using potential malware code techniques. There's nothing
   significant exposed in the Registry. I couldn't just set Security
   Enabled to False. My attempts to kill its two core processes ended in
   Access Denied, as did my attempts to manipulate its essential Windows
   service. Of course, a malicious program couldn't even try these attacks
   without getting past every other layer of protection.

   While not precisely part of firewall protection, the Network Monitor
   component gives tech-savvy users insight into just what applications
   are using bandwidth. A live graph charts overall inbound and outbound
   traffic, and a list of actively connected programs breaks down that
   usage, showing who's using what.

Trusted Applications Mode

   You will probably find that Kaspersky puts all or most of your active
   applications in the Trusted category. Trusted Applications mode kicks
   the concept up a notch by denying execution to any process that it
   can't verify as trusted. To start, it scans all your files and
   identifies the trusted ones. After it's done, it doesn't allow any
   untrusted programs to run. This mode is especially useful on a computer
   that doesn't see a lot of new software installations.

   This mode's whitelist-based functionality is similar in some ways to
   that of VoodooSoft VoodooShield. The main difference with VoodooShield
   is it applies its rules only when the computer is at risk, such as when
   it's connected to the internet.

   Kaspersky does warn that the initial scan can take a long time, and
   indeed, on my test system it ran for nearly two hours. When it
   finishes, pay attention! If it finds unknown system files, carefully
   review what it found. In my case, it found an Intel driver, one of my
   hand-coded utilities, and a sketchy-looking .DAT file.

   There's one more important step, and that's reviewing all the unknown
   files that Trusted Applications mode will block. On my test system, the
   list of untrusted files included all my hand-coded testing and
   evaluation utilities, which makes perfect sense. Be sure to peruse this
   list carefully and unblock any important programs.

   With Trusted Applications mode active, it should be impossible for
   malware to run on your system, even malware so new that no antivirus
   researcher in the world has seen it. It may also block new programs
   that you're attempting to install. Don't worry; the blocking
   notification includes a link that lets you mark an unknown program as
   trusted.

Optional Spam Filter

   If you use a web-based email system like Yahoo or Gmail, you probably
   don't see a lot of spam, because it gets filtered out by the provider.
   Likewise, if your email comes through your workplace most spam gets
   filtered out at the mail server. Kaspersky's spam filtering is turned
   off by default, but you can turn it on by clicking the Settings gear,
   clicking Protection at left, and scrolling down to Anti-Spam.

   Kaspersky checks email coming from both POP3 and IMAP accounts, marking
   up spam and possible spam by modifying the subject line. Its filter has
   three modes, Recommended, High, and Low. As you might expect, setting
   it to High blocks more spam but might also discard valid mail. Changing
   the setting to Low goes the other way, possibly allowing more spam but
   avoiding the possibility that you'll lose an important message to the
   spam filter.

   That's it for basic settings. If you dare to open the Advanced Settings
   page, there are a few more options, but not the overwhelming number of
   pages that come with spam filtering in Check Point ZoneAlarm Extreme
   Security. You can change the subject line label it uses to flag spam.
   You can configure a list of blocked phrases or obscene words, meaning
   any message containing them should be considered spam. Finally, you can
   manage lists of allowed and blocked senders. For most users, the
   default settings should be fine.

Parental Control

   Like spam filtering, parental control is a feature that many people
   don't need. Kaspersky previously offered a somewhat dated but
   full-featured parental control system in this suite. It had content
   filtering, time scheduling, personal data protection, and even game
   control based on ESRB ratings. With the 2020 product line, Kaspersky
   Safe Kids takes over the parental control job.

   Kaspersky Internet Security Parental

   Note, though, that what you get is the free, feature-limited version of
   Safe Kids. As with Kaspersky Security Cloud Free, a shield icon
   identifies features that require a premium upgrade. You get a content
   filter that lets you either block access to specified categories or
   display a warning before the child visits a matching site. Likewise,
   you can set a daily limit on device usage and either warn when time's
   up or block further usage. (Setting a weekly schedule for usage is a
   premium feature). Finally, you can ban or time-limit specific apps.

   Premium features include the ability to locate the child's device, get
   a geofencing notification when the child enters or leaves a location,
   monitor social network activity, get a warning if the battery is low on
   the child's device, and get real-time alerts on risky activity. Do read
   our review of Kaspersky Safe Kids if you need this feature. You may
   decide that an extra $14.99 per year for unlimited kids and unlimited
   devices is a bargain.

   The macOS equivalent of this product, Kaspersky Internet Security for
   Mac, also gets the free version of Safe Kids. Only at the top tier,
   with Kaspersky Total Security or Kaspersky Security Cloud, do you get
   premium features built in.

Webcam and Privacy Protection

   Have you ever looked up a product online and then found ads for that
   product infesting the websites you visit? Creepy, right? Kaspersky's
   Private Browsing feature can help, blocking ad agencies, web analytics,
   and other trackers, but by default it just watches and reports tracking
   attempts. If you want it to take action, click Privacy Protection and
   check the option to block data collection. By default, Kaspersky
   exempts websites belonging to itself and its partners, but you can put
   them on the chopping block, too. Just click the Private Browsing link
   to bring up settings. It also refrains from blocking ads when doing so
   might disable the website.

   The Kaspersky toolbar icon in your browser displays the number of
   trackers blocked on the current page. You can click for a breakdown of
   the tracking types, and dig in further to see the exact trackers. A
   related feature, Anti-Banner, suppresses banner ads from the sites you
   visit. Remember, however, that many of your favorite sites rely on ad
   revenue to bring you the pages you like. Use Anti-Banner responsibly.

   Kaspersky Internet Security Webcam

   For a completely different take on privacy, Kaspersky offers spyware
   protection in the form of a webcam control tool. If you set it to deny
   access, it warns you any time an untrusted process attempts to access
   the webcam. Were you setting up a video conference? No problem. You can
   add the conferencing program to the trusted list. But if the warning
   comes without any relation to what you're doing, thank Kaspersky for
   blocking some creep from peeking through your webcam. You can also set
   it to block webcam access for all processes.

   When I launched Skype, Kaspersky placed a floating notification at the
   top of the screen letting me know that it allowed webcam access. From
   that notification I could pull down a menu to hide the notification,
   block access, or open the corresponding settings page. When I tweaked
   the settings to block all access, Skype couldn't find the camera, and
   Kaspersky slid in a transient notification at bottom right indicating
   that it blocked an attempt to use the webcam.

Software Updater

   The vulnerability scan that comes with Kaspersky Anti-Virus notifies
   you of missing security patches, but it doesn't do anything beyond
   pointing out the problem. In the suite, you get the Software Updater,
   which handles the whole process for you.

   You don't even have to launch the updater. It runs automatically in the
   background, and it notifies you if it discovers any available updates.
   Just review its findings, click Update All, and let it do the work. If
   the update doesn't require acceptance of a license agreement, it can
   handle the entire update process automatically.

   Keeping your operating system and applications updated with all
   security patches is another way to defend against exploit attacks.
   Avast Premier and Avira Total Security Suite also offer automatic
   patching, but these two are the top of their respective product lines,
   while Kaspersky Internet Security is just the entry-level Kaspersky
   suite, with Kaspersky Total Security and Kaspersky Security Cloud above
   it.

PC Cleaner

   The name PC Cleaner might suggest that this is a component designed to
   clean up junk files, or to remove traces of your computer activities.
   Both of those are common bonus features in security suites. In fact,
   components shared with the antivirus handle both those tasks. The PC
   Cleaner's purpose is completely different.

   This scan looks for programs that aren't malware, and aren't even in
   the low-risk potentially unwanted program category. It aims to find
   programs that you might want to remove, for many reasons. These include
   nonstandard installations, programs you rarely use, and programs that
   may be adware.

   My test scan didn't take long. It reported that I rarely use Firefox,
   which is true in a way. I use it in testing, but revert the virtual
   machine back to a safe state afterward, eliminating any evidence that I
   used it. Kaspersky gave me the option to uninstall Firefox or to hide
   it in the report. This feature also lets you report an annoying
   application to Kaspersky by pointing it out with a crosshair-shaped
   cursor.

Kaspersky's Mac Protection

   In a cross-platform security service, it's very common for Mac users to
   get the short end of the stick. Installed on Windows, such a product
   manifests as a security suite exploding with features; installed on a
   Mac, it's a basic antivirus. It's refreshing to see that Kaspersky
   doesn't follow this trend. Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac offers a
   full suite of protective features but (as a standalone) costs no more
   than most Mac antivirus products. Please read my review for a full
   report on my findings; the digest that follows sums them up.

   Two of the independent antivirus labs that I follow test Mac antivirus
   as well as Windows, and both put Kaspersky through testing. Like
   Bitdefender, Kaspersky detected 100 percent of the Mac malware that
   researchers at AV-Comparatives hit it with. Both also earned the top
   score in a test using Windows malware. Bitdefender, Norton, Trend
   Micro, and Vipre earned the best possible score with AV-Test Institute,
   while Kaspersky came close, missing by one-half point.

   Kaspersky Internet Security macOS

   Phishing sites, those frauds that try to steal your secure login
   credentials, aren't specific to any platform, but protection against
   phishing can differ on different operating systems. In past years,
   Kaspersky has scored lower on the Mac than on Windows. This time
   around, it managed 100 percent detection on both platforms.

   Safe Money exists on the Mac, but it's different. Rather than actively
   protecting the browser, it verifies that you're visiting a legitimate
   financial website, not a clever fraud. Parental control uses the same
   free-level installation of Kaspersky Safe Kids.

   Webcam protection on the Mac is a simple on/off switch, without the
   system of trusted applications that always get access. It can block
   browser tracking, though it doesn't display the number of trackers for
   the current site. Other features include a network attack blocker,
   search results markup, and an on-screen keyboard. You can also install
   Kaspersky Secure Connect and Kaspersky Password Manager. This is a full
   security suite, not just a simple Mac antivirus.

Kaspersky's Android Protection

   Anybody can download and use the free edition of Kaspersky Mobile
   Security. It's also part of Kaspersky Security Cloud Free. By logging
   in to My Kaspersky and adding the device to your license, you get the
   full set of features. The main window reflects your security status;
   when all's well it shows a big green shield. You can select other
   features from an expandable panel of icons. A left-rail menu offers
   another way to access features.

   Immediately after installation, it runs an update and a scan. Even
   after that first scan, the app's main window remains yellow, meaning
   you've got work to do. Once you actively turn on internet protection,
   you reach serene green status. In addition to this on-demand scan,
   Kaspersky offers real-time protection, checking all new apps and
   processes. A recommendations page walks you through setup choices,
   including enabling anti-theft and setting up privacy protection.

   Previous versions of this app included a feature called Privacy
   Protection, which maintained a list of private contacts that don't show
   up in your address book or history. This feature had its problems, not
   the least of which is incompatibility with Android 4.4 or newer.
   Privacy Protection is no longer a part of the Android app. Text
   Anti-Phishing had the same compatibility problems, and has also been
   removed.

   The Android device I use for testing isn't provisioned for cellular
   calling, so I couldn't test the Call Filter. This feature promises to
   block calls from any numbers on a user-defined blacklist. It can
   optionally prompt you after each all from an unknown number, asking
   whether to blacklist that number. Blocked callers just get a busy
   signal.

   Kaspersky Internet Security Android

   Kaspersky's anti-theft features include the expected remote locate,
   lock, and wipe, as well as the ability to sound a noisy alarm (handy
   when you can't remember where you left the device). The implementation
   is a bit different from that of Bitdefender and most others. You can't
   just locate the device willy-nilly. A single action in My Kaspersky
   online both locks the device and reports its location. On the plus
   side, this means that even if your My Kaspersky account is compromised,
   the hacker can't track your location without your knowledge.

   Likewise, if you want to get mug shots of the person who's using your
   device, you must also lock it. Whether you're just locking the device
   or requesting mug shots, you can include a message. And if someone
   swaps out the SIM, Kaspersky sends you the new number.

   Kaspersky also lets you put selected apps behind a PIN or fingerprint
   lock. Even if someone picks up your phone or tablet while it's
   unlocked, this could prevent access to your email, or social media. The
   similar feature in Bitdefender goes farther than the simple lock, with
   options like automatically unlocking when on trusted networks, and
   allowing a brief hiatus before requiring the lock code again.

Small Performance Hit

   Security companies know that if their products visibly impact
   performance, users will turn them off, or jump ship to a different
   brand. Few modern security suites slow down PCs, but I still run some
   simple tests to measure each product's impact.

   Loading up all a suite's set of security components at startup could
   slow down the boot process, lengthening the wait until the computer is
   ready to use. My boot-time measurement script checks CPU usage once per
   second, deeming the system to be ready after 10 consecutive seconds
   with CPU usage under five percent. Subtracting the start of the boot
   process (as reported by Windows) yields the boot time. I average
   multiple runs with no security installed and compare the result with
   the average after installing the suite. Kaspersky added 31 percent to
   the boot time, a matter of 20 seconds or so. It's a bigger hit than I
   saw last time I tested this product, but you still probably won't
   notice.

   Performance Results Chart

   There's a possibility that your suite's real-time antivirus monitoring
   could put a drag on everyday file manipulation activities. I use a
   script that moves and copies a large and eclectic collection of files
   between drives, averaging multiple runs before and after installing the
   suite. This script took just 14 percent longer with Kaspersky active.
   Another script that zips and unzips the same file collection repeatedly
   took 7 percent longer.

   With an average impact of 17 percent, Kaspersky still has a light
   touch, though it scored below Bitdefender this time around. Note,
   though, that ESET, G Data, and Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security
   Plus exhibited no impact in any of the three tests.

A Feature-Rich Suite

   The point of installing a security suite is to get all necessary
   security features working together in a single, integrated package.
   Kaspersky Internet Security is an excellent example, with a feature
   collection well beyond what you get in most suites. It could even
   qualify as a cross-platform suite, given its support for macOS and
   Android, but Kaspersky Security Cloud is a better fit for that
   category.

   Bitdefender Internet Security, like Kaspersky, routinely gets perfect
   or near-perfect scores from the testing labs. Also like Kaspersky, it
   offers features way beyond the basics. We've named these two Editors'
   Choice for entry-level security suite.

   Bottom Line: Kaspersky Internet Security gets top scores from the
   antivirus testing labs. It comes with everything you'd expect in a
   suite, along with plenty of extras, and its components are consistently
   effective.

                     Avid Blames Google for Mac Pro Crashes

   Avid confirms that the crash and failure to reboot of Mac Pros across
   Hollywood was nothing to do with its software, with the blame falling
   on a Google Chrome update.

   Mac Pro (trash can)

   UPDATE 9/25: Avid has released a statement confirming that the root
   cause of Mac Pros crashing this week was in fact a Chrome update
   released by Google. The update includes a bug that "damages the file
   system on macOS machines." Information relating to the bug can be found
   on the Google Chrome Help community website.

   Avid CEO Jeff Rosica stated, "Avid is pleased that the reboot issue
   facing some customers is solved and while Avid products are not the
   root cause, we're keeping an intense focus on bringing all of our
   customers back online and back to work. Over the past 36 hours, the
   deep dive of due diligence working closely with Apple, PACE and other
   partners exhausted all options and we've landed in the right place as
   quickly as possible. We owe our special thanks to Avid's customer and
   user community for their typically strong show of support at this time,
   especially to those who welcomed our engineers into their studios to
   troubleshoot."

   Original Story 9/24:
   The combination of a Mac Pro and Avid's Media Composer video-editing
   software is a common one across Hollywood. However, since yesterday
   it's been causing Mac Pros to slowly crash and refuse to reboot.

   As Variety reports, the movie and TV industry in Los Angeles is
   "sweating" today because the trashcan Mac Pros they rely on to work are
   failing and nobody knows why yet. The Macs are refusing to reboot, with
   the Avid Editors of Facebook group urging people not to turn off their
   Macs as the tweet below show.

     BIG ALERT tonight regarding #Apple, and #MacOS running on the can.
     DO NOT SHUT DOWN!! #AvidEditors #Avid Apparently something is
     corrupting one of the UNIX root level folders. Back up everything,
     not just on the servers is you are in a connected environment. Refer
     to below FB pg pic.twitter.com/iLlfHVRfmp
     — MarcusPun (@MarcusPun) September 24, 2019

   In a statement, Avid said it's "aware of the reboot issue affecting
   Apple Mac Pro devices running some Avid products, which arose late
   yesterday. The company also released the video included below to help
   explain the situation and offer some guidance while the problem is
   identified and solved:

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uuwbgGMTJA

   One way to test if your Mac Pro is affected is to go into System
   Preferences and then Users & Groups. If you know your account is set as
   admin, but the preferences only show you as a regular user, your system
   has been compromised and will likely fail to reboot if shut down.

   Editor's Note: This story was updated at 1:30 p.m. ET on Sept. 25 with
   details of Google Chrome bug.

     * Pros
       Top-notch scores from four labs. Best antiphishing score. Firewall
       with powerful application control. Protection for macOS and Android
       devices. Automated security patching. Webcam protection. Many bonus
       features.
     * Cons
       Hard to find some settings.
     * Bottom Line
       Kaspersky Internet Security gets top scores from the antivirus
       testing labs. It comes with everything you'd expect in a suite,
       along with plenty of extras, and its components are consistently
       effective.

   Editors' Choice

   Editors' Note: We are aware of the allegations of Kaspersky's
   inappropriate ties to the Russian government. Until we see some actual
   proof of these allegations, we will treat them as unproven, and
   continue to recommend Kaspersky's security products as long as their
   performance continues to merit our endorsement.
   Antivirus protection for all your computers is a must, especially with
   ransomware on the rise, but antivirus isn't all you need. A full-scale
   security suite offers protection on many other levels. Kaspersky
   Internet Security takes an award-winning antivirus and adds firewall,
   spam filtering, parental control, a VPN, and more. And all these
   security components do their jobs well.

   This suite lists at $79.99 per year for three licenses or $89.99 for
   five licenses. First-time users can often get a significant discount.
   You can use your licenses to protect Windows, macOS, or Android
   devices. That same $89.99 price gets you unlimited cross-platform
   licenses for McAfee Internet Security. Symantec Norton 360 Deluxe costs
   $99.99 per year for five licenses, but that also includes five
   no-limits VPN licenses. With Kaspersky, you pay $4.99 per month to
   remove the VPN's limitations.

   the top. If there's a configuration problem it offers a link to set
   things right; if not, it may still have some recommendations. There are
   six big button panels labeled Scan, Database Update, Safe Money,
   Privacy Protection, Parental Control, and My Kaspersky. Below these is
   a button to bring up a menu of more tools, and a gear icon at bottom
   left to open Settings. I had trouble finding desired settings a few
   times, because the Protection page features 15 distinct components, in
   no order that I could determine. I'd like to see a Search box for
   settings, like you get with Norton.

   Kaspersky Internet Security Main

Features Shared With Free Protection

   This suite overlaps most security features found in Kaspersky Security
   Cloud Free, though the free product models itself on Kaspersky Security
   Cloud, not on this suite or on the commercial Kaspersky Anti-Virus.
   I'll summarize the security features shared with Kaspersky Free; you
   can read that review for full details.

   Lab Test Results Chart
   Malware Protection Results Chart
   Phishing Protection Results Chart

   All four of the independent antivirus testing labs I follow include
   Kaspersky in their regular reports. In the latest set of reports,
   Kaspersky earned the maximum possible score in every test but one.
   Bitdefender Internet Security managed the same feat. Both top the list,
   with 9.9 of 10 possible aggregate lab points.

   In the past, Kaspersky reserved the System Watcher behavioral detection
   component for paid products, but with the 2019 edition that feature has
   made it into the free antivirus. I tested this feature and found that
   it caught all my encrypting ransomware samples even with the regular
   real-time protection turned off. A simple screen-locker ransomware
   slipped past System Watcher, but I broke its hold using Kaspersky's
   dedicated lock-breaker keystroke (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F4 by default).

   Kaspersky didn't fare quite as well in my hands-on malware protection
   test, scoring 8.7 of 10 possible points. However, when my results don't
   jibe with the labs, I defer to the work of the dozens of dedicated
   researchers in the labs. Webroot detected 100 percent of these samples
   and scored 9.7 points. In a rare winning position, Windows Defender
   topped Webroot, earning 9.8 points.

   Tested with my previous sample set, Norton, G Data Internet Security,
   and Sophos all detected 97 percent. They scored 9.7, 9.5, and 9.3
   points respectively.

   When I challenged Kaspersky to protect against malware downloads from a
   hundred recently discovered malware-hosting URLs, it either blocked
   access to the URL or eliminated the download 89 percent of the time.
   That's good, but Trend Micro Internet Security and F-Secure managed 99
   percent protection.

   Kaspersky's Web Anti-Virus component proved more adept at detecting
   phishing frauds than at flagging malware-hosting URLs. It managed 100
   percent detection in my hands-on antiphishing test, tying with McAee
   for the top score. Bitdefender wasn't far behind, with 99 percent
   detection. It's worth noting that the macOS equivalents of these three
   products scored precisely the same.

   SecurityWatch

   All of Kaspersky's security products come with a free,
   bandwidth-limited edition of the Kaspersky Secure Connection VPN.
   Powered by AnchorFree Hotspot Shield Elite, the VPN lets you use 200MB
   of bandwidth per day on each device. Paying an extra $4.99 per month
   lifts the banewidth cap and lets you specify the country for your VPN
   server. Bitdefender offers a very similar deal, also powered by
   AnchorFree. Other bonus features include an on-screen keyboard to foil
   keyloggers and a markup system to flag dangerous links in search
   results.

   Clicking More Tools brings up pages of additional tools, many of which
   are not available to users of the free edition. Among the tools that
   don't require a premium purchase are a file shredder, a rescue disk,
   and several tools designed to clean and optimize your PC.

Features Shared With Premium Antivirus

   One big plus to paying for Kaspersky Anti-Virus is that you get
   full-scale tech support, via phone or live chat. Users of the free
   edition must rely on FAQs and forums.

   te=true

   Hackers find security holes and security companies patch those holes.
   If you fail to apply the patches, you can have big trouble. The
   Vulnerability Scan reports on any missing patches for Windows and
   popular applications. It also reports on configuration settings that
   are bad for security, with an option to fix those automatically.

Safe Money

   When you navigate to a banking site or other sensitive website,
   Kaspersky offers to open that site in the Safe Money protected browser.
   By default, once you've accepted that offer, it always opens that site
   in the protected browser. Bitdefender's Safepay feature works in much
   the same way.

   A green border around the browser, along with a semi-transparent
   overlay notice, reminds you that you're in this special, protected
   mode, in a browser that's isolated from other processes. It even foils
   screen-scraping spy programs. You can open the notification area icon's
   menu and choose from a list of sites you've visited with Safe Money, to
   quickly revisit any of them.

Firewall and Application Control

   The earliest personal firewalls developed a reputation for bombarding
   the user with incomprehensible queries. Brekekekex.exe wants to connect
   to IP address 200.199.198.197 using port 8080—allow, or block? Most
   users lack the knowledge to answer that question with confidence. Some
   users always click Allow. Others always click Block, until they break
   something, at which point they switch to Allow. Fear not, Kaspersky
   handles application control itself, without popping up confusing
   queries.

   Using data from the Kaspersky Security Network database, the
   application control system flags each application as Trusted, Low
   Restricted, High Restricted, or Untrusted. Untrusted apps simply don't
   get to run. Others that aren't in the Trusted category can run, but
   with limited access to sensitive system areas.

   Kaspersky Internet Security Firewall

   It's not uncommon for application installers to bundle additional
   products, items you didn't request. As part of its job, Application
   Manager automatically clears checkboxes offering additional software
   and suppresses application steps that include ads or bundled items. It
   works something like the Bundle Protection feature in Reason Core
   Security.

   Of course, a firewall also must protect your system against attack from
   the internet. To check that feature, I hit the test system with 30
   exploits generated by the CORE Impact penetration tool. Kaspersky
   detected and blocked 44 percent of the exploits. That's precisely the
   same as Bitdefender's recent score, though Kaspersky identified more of
   them using their official exploit tracking number. Even the missed
   exploits didn't breach security, since the test system has all security
   patches, but it's good to see that Kaspersky is on the alert for such
   attacks.

   The exploit detection scores by Kaspersky and Bitdefender beat most
   competitors, but Symantec Norton Security Deluxe spotted and blocked 85
   percent of the exploits, while G Data and ESET caught 68 and 55 percent
   respectively.

   Your security protection is worthless if a malicious program or script
   can turn it off. Kaspersky's self-defense proved effective when I
   attacked it using potential malware code techniques. There's nothing
   significant exposed in the Registry. I couldn't just set Security
   Enabled to False. My attempts to kill its two core processes ended in
   Access Denied, as did my attempts to manipulate its essential Windows
   service. Of course, a malicious program couldn't even try these attacks
   without getting past every other layer of protection.

   While not precisely part of firewall protection, the Network Monitor
   component gives tech-savvy users insight into just what applications
   are using bandwidth. A live graph charts overall inbound and outbound
   traffic, and a list of actively connected programs breaks down that
   usage, showing who's using what.

Trusted Applications Mode

   You will probably find that Kaspersky puts all or most of your active
   applications in the Trusted category. Trusted Applications mode kicks
   the concept up a notch by denying execution to any process that it
   can't verify as trusted. To start, it scans all your files and
   identifies the trusted ones. After it's done, it doesn't allow any
   untrusted programs to run. This mode is especially useful on a computer
   that doesn't see a lot of new software installations.

   This mode's whitelist-based functionality is similar in some ways to
   that of VoodooSoft VoodooShield. The main difference with VoodooShield
   is it applies its rules only when the computer is at risk, such as when
   it's connected to the internet.

   Kaspersky does warn that the initial scan can take a long time, and
   indeed, on my test system it ran for nearly two hours. When it
   finishes, pay attention! If it finds unknown system files, carefully
   review what it found. In my case, it found an Intel driver, one of my
   hand-coded utilities, and a sketchy-looking .DAT file.

   There's one more important step, and that's reviewing all the unknown
   files that Trusted Applications mode will block. On my test system, the
   list of untrusted files included all my hand-coded testing and
   evaluation utilities, which makes perfect sense. Be sure to peruse this
   list carefully and unblock any important programs.

   With Trusted Applications mode active, it should be impossible for
   malware to run on your system, even malware so new that no antivirus
   researcher in the world has seen it. It may also block new programs
   that you're attempting to install. Don't worry; the blocking
   notification includes a link that lets you mark an unknown program as
   trusted.

Optional Spam Filter

   If you use a web-based email system like Yahoo or Gmail, you probably
   don't see a lot of spam, because it gets filtered out by the provider.
   Likewise, if your email comes through your workplace most spam gets
   filtered out at the mail server. Kaspersky's spam filtering is turned
   off by default, but you can turn it on by clicking the Settings gear,
   clicking Protection at left, and scrolling down to Anti-Spam.

   Kaspersky checks email coming from both POP3 and IMAP accounts, marking
   up spam and possible spam by modifying the subject line. Its filter has
   three modes, Recommended, High, and Low. As you might expect, setting
   it to High blocks more spam but might also discard valid mail. Changing
   the setting to Low goes the other way, possibly allowing more spam but
   avoiding the possibility that you'll lose an important message to the
   spam filter.

   That's it for basic settings. If you dare to open the Advanced Settings
   page, there are a few more options, but not the overwhelming number of
   pages that come with spam filtering in Check Point ZoneAlarm Extreme
   Security. You can change the subject line label it uses to flag spam.
   You can configure a list of blocked phrases or obscene words, meaning
   any message containing them should be considered spam. Finally, you can
   manage lists of allowed and blocked senders. For most users, the
   default settings should be fine.

Parental Control

   Like spam filtering, parental control is a feature that many people
   don't need. Kaspersky previously offered a somewhat dated but
   full-featured parental control system in this suite. It had content
   filtering, time scheduling, personal data protection, and even game
   control based on ESRB ratings. With the 2020 product line, Kaspersky
   Safe Kids takes over the parental control job.

   Kaspersky Internet Security Parental

   Note, though, that what you get is the free, feature-limited version of
   Safe Kids. As with Kaspersky Security Cloud Free, a shield icon
   identifies features that require a premium upgrade. You get a content
   filter that lets you either block access to specified categories or
   display a warning before the child visits a matching site. Likewise,
   you can set a daily limit on device usage and either warn when time's
   up or block further usage. (Setting a weekly schedule for usage is a
   premium feature). Finally, you can ban or time-limit specific apps.

   Premium features include the ability to locate the child's device, get
   a geofencing notification when the child enters or leaves a location,
   monitor social network activity, get a warning if the battery is low on
   the child's device, and get real-time alerts on risky activity. Do read
   our review of Kaspersky Safe Kids if you need this feature. You may
   decide that an extra $14.99 per year for unlimited kids and unlimited
   devices is a bargain.

   The macOS equivalent of this product, Kaspersky Internet Security for
   Mac, also gets the free version of Safe Kids. Only at the top tier,
   with Kaspersky Total Security or Kaspersky Security Cloud, do you get
   premium features built in.

Webcam and Privacy Protection

   Have you ever looked up a product online and then found ads for that
   product infesting the websites you visit? Creepy, right? Kaspersky's
   Private Browsing feature can help, blocking ad agencies, web analytics,
   and other trackers, but by default it just watches and reports tracking
   attempts. If you want it to take action, click Privacy Protection and
   check the option to block data collection. By default, Kaspersky
   exempts websites belonging to itself and its partners, but you can put
   them on the chopping block, too. Just click the Private Browsing link
   to bring up settings. It also refrains from blocking ads when doing so
   might disable the website.

   The Kaspersky toolbar icon in your browser displays the number of
   trackers blocked on the current page. You can click for a breakdown of
   the tracking types, and dig in further to see the exact trackers. A
   related feature, Anti-Banner, suppresses banner ads from the sites you
   visit. Remember, however, that many of your favorite sites rely on ad
   revenue to bring you the pages you like. Use Anti-Banner responsibly.

   Kaspersky Internet Security Webcam

   For a completely different take on privacy, Kaspersky offers spyware
   protection in the form of a webcam control tool. If you set it to deny
   access, it warns you any time an untrusted process attempts to access
   the webcam. Were you setting up a video conference? No problem. You can
   add the conferencing program to the trusted list. But if the warning
   comes without any relation to what you're doing, thank Kaspersky for
   blocking some creep from peeking through your webcam. You can also set
   it to block webcam access for all processes.

   When I launched Skype, Kaspersky placed a floating notification at the
   top of the screen letting me know that it allowed webcam access. From
   that notification I could pull down a menu to hide the notification,
   block access, or open the corresponding settings page. When I tweaked
   the settings to block all access, Skype couldn't find the camera, and
   Kaspersky slid in a transient notification at bottom right indicating
   that it blocked an attempt to use the webcam.

Software Updater

   The vulnerability scan that comes with Kaspersky Anti-Virus notifies
   you of missing security patches, but it doesn't do anything beyond
   pointing out the problem. In the suite, you get the Software Updater,
   which handles the whole process for you.

   You don't even have to launch the updater. It runs automatically in the
   background, and it notifies you if it discovers any available updates.
   Just review its findings, click Update All, and let it do the work. If
   the update doesn't require acceptance of a license agreement, it can
   handle the entire update process automatically.

   Keeping your operating system and applications updated with all
   security patches is another way to defend against exploit attacks.
   Avast Premier and Avira Total Security Suite also offer automatic
   patching, but these two are the top of their respective product lines,
   while Kaspersky Internet Security is just the entry-level Kaspersky
   suite, with Kaspersky Total Security and Kaspersky Security Cloud above
   it.

PC Cleaner

   The name PC Cleaner might suggest that this is a component designed to
   clean up junk files, or to remove traces of your computer activities.
   Both of those are common bonus features in security suites. In fact,
   components shared with the antivirus handle both those tasks. The PC
   Cleaner's purpose is completely different.

   This scan looks for programs that aren't malware, and aren't even in
   the low-risk potentially unwanted program category. It aims to find
   programs that you might want to remove, for many reasons. These include
   nonstandard installations, programs you rarely use, and programs that
   may be adware.

   My test scan didn't take long. It reported that I rarely use Firefox,
   which is true in a way. I use it in testing, but revert the virtual
   machine back to a safe state afterward, eliminating any evidence that I
   used it. Kaspersky gave me the option to uninstall Firefox or to hide
   it in the report. This feature also lets you report an annoying
   application to Kaspersky by pointing it out with a crosshair-shaped
   cursor.

Kaspersky's Mac Protection

   In a cross-platform security service, it's very common for Mac users to
   get the short end of the stick. Installed on Windows, such a product
   manifests as a security suite exploding with features; installed on a
   Mac, it's a basic antivirus. It's refreshing to see that Kaspersky
   doesn't follow this trend. Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac offers a
   full suite of protective features but (as a standalone) costs no more
   than most Mac antivirus products. Please read my review for a full
   report on my findings; the digest that follows sums them up.

   Two of the independent antivirus labs that I follow test Mac antivirus
   as well as Windows, and both put Kaspersky through testing. Like
   Bitdefender, Kaspersky detected 100 percent of the Mac malware that
   researchers at AV-Comparatives hit it with. Both also earned the top
   score in a test using Windows malware. Bitdefender, Norton, Trend
   Micro, and Vipre earned the best possible score with AV-Test Institute,
   while Kaspersky came close, missing by one-half point.

   Kaspersky Internet Security macOS

   Phishing sites, those frauds that try to steal your secure login
   credentials, aren't specific to any platform, but protection against
   phishing can differ on different operating systems. In past years,
   Kaspersky has scored lower on the Mac than on Windows. This time
   around, it managed 100 percent detection on both platforms.

   Safe Money exists on the Mac, but it's different. Rather than actively
   protecting the browser, it verifies that you're visiting a legitimate
   financial website, not a clever fraud. Parental control uses the same
   free-level installation of Kaspersky Safe Kids.

   Webcam protection on the Mac is a simple on/off switch, without the
   system of trusted applications that always get access. It can block
   browser tracking, though it doesn't display the number of trackers for
   the current site. Other features include a network attack blocker,
   search results markup, and an on-screen keyboard. You can also install
   Kaspersky Secure Connect and Kaspersky Password Manager. This is a full
   security suite, not just a simple Mac antivirus.

Kaspersky's Android Protection

   Anybody can download and use the free edition of Kaspersky Mobile
   Security. It's also part of Kaspersky Security Cloud Free. By logging
   in to My Kaspersky and adding the device to your license, you get the
   full set of features. The main window reflects your security status;
   when all's well it shows a big green shield. You can select other
   features from an expandable panel of icons. A left-rail menu offers
   another way to access features.

   Immediately after installation, it runs an update and a scan. Even
   after that first scan, the app's main window remains yellow, meaning
   you've got work to do. Once you actively turn on internet protection,
   you reach serene green status. In addition to this on-demand scan,
   Kaspersky offers real-time protection, checking all new apps and
   processes. A recommendations page walks you through setup choices,
   including enabling anti-theft and setting up privacy protection.

   Previous versions of this app included a feature called Privacy
   Protection, which maintained a list of private contacts that don't show
   up in your address book or history. This feature had its problems, not
   the least of which is incompatibility with Android 4.4 or newer.
   Privacy Protection is no longer a part of the Android app. Text
   Anti-Phishing had the same compatibility problems, and has also been
   removed.

   The Android device I use for testing isn't provisioned for cellular
   calling, so I couldn't test the Call Filter. This feature promises to
   block calls from any numbers on a user-defined blacklist. It can
   optionally prompt you after each all from an unknown number, asking
   whether to blacklist that number. Blocked callers just get a busy
   signal.

   Kaspersky Internet Security Android

   Kaspersky's anti-theft features include the expected remote locate,
   lock, and wipe, as well as the ability to sound a noisy alarm (handy
   when you can't remember where you left the device). The implementation
   is a bit different from that of Bitdefender and most others. You can't
   just locate the device willy-nilly. A single action in My Kaspersky
   online both locks the device and reports its location. On the plus
   side, this means that even if your My Kaspersky account is compromised,
   the hacker can't track your location without your knowledge.

   Likewise, if you want to get mug shots of the person who's using your
   device, you must also lock it. Whether you're just locking the device
   or requesting mug shots, you can include a message. And if someone
   swaps out the SIM, Kaspersky sends you the new number.

   Kaspersky also lets you put selected apps behind a PIN or fingerprint
   lock. Even if someone picks up your phone or tablet while it's
   unlocked, this could prevent access to your email, or social media. The
   similar feature in Bitdefender goes farther than the simple lock, with
   options like automatically unlocking when on trusted networks, and
   allowing a brief hiatus before requiring the lock code again.

Small Performance Hit

   Security companies know that if their products visibly impact
   performance, users will turn them off, or jump ship to a different
   brand. Few modern security suites slow down PCs, but I still run some
   simple tests to measure each product's impact.

   Loading up all a suite's set of security components at startup could
   slow down the boot process, lengthening the wait until the computer is
   ready to use. My boot-time measurement script checks CPU usage once per
   second, deeming the system to be ready after 10 consecutive seconds
   with CPU usage under five percent. Subtracting the start of the boot
   process (as reported by Windows) yields the boot time. I average
   multiple runs with no security installed and compare the result with
   the average after installing the suite. Kaspersky added 31 percent to
   the boot time, a matter of 20 seconds or so. It's a bigger hit than I
   saw last time I tested this product, but you still probably won't
   notice.

   Performance Results Chart

   There's a possibility that your suite's real-time antivirus monitoring
   could put a drag on everyday file manipulation activities. I use a
   script that moves and copies a large and eclectic collection of files
   between drives, averaging multiple runs before and after installing the
   suite. This script took just 14 percent longer with Kaspersky active.
   Another script that zips and unzips the same file collection repeatedly
   took 7 percent longer.

   With an average impact of 17 percent, Kaspersky still has a light
   touch, though it scored below Bitdefender this time around. Note,
   though, that ESET, G Data, and Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security
   Plus exhibited no impact in any of the three tests.

A Feature-Rich Suite

   The point of installing a security suite is to get all necessary
   security features working together in a single, integrated package.
   Kaspersky Internet Security is an excellent example, with a feature
   collection well beyond what you get in most suites. It could even
   qualify as a cross-platform suite, given its support for macOS and
   Android, but Kaspersky Security Cloud is a better fit for that
   category.

   Bitdefender Internet Security, like Kaspersky, routinely gets perfect
   or near-perfect scores from the testing labs. Also like Kaspersky, it
   offers features way beyond the basics. We've named these two Editors'
   Choice for entry-level security suite.

   Note: These sub-ratings contribute to a product's overall star rating,
   as do other factors, including ease of use in real-world testing, bonus
   features, and overall integration of features.

Avid Blames Google for Mac Pro Crashes

   Avid confirms that the crash and failure to reboot of Mac Pros across
   Hollywood was nothing to do with its software, with the blame falling
   on a Google Chrome update.

   UPDATE 9/25: Avid has released a statement confirming that the root
   cause of Mac Pros crashing this week was in fact a Chrome update
   released by Google. The update includes a bug that "damages the file
   system on macOS machines." Information relating to the bug can be found
   on the Google Chrome Help community website.

   Avid CEO Jeff Rosica stated, "Avid is pleased that the reboot issue
   facing some customers is solved and while Avid products are not the
   root cause, we're keeping an intense focus on bringing all of our
   customers back online and back to work. Over the past 36 hours, the
   deep dive of due diligence working closely with Apple, PACE and other
   partners exhausted all options and we've landed in the right place as
   quickly as possible. We owe our special thanks to Avid's customer and
   user community for their typically strong show of support at this time,
   especially to those who welcomed our engineers into their studios to
   troubleshoot."

   Original Story 9/24:
   The combination of a Mac Pro and Avid's Media Composer video-editing
   software is a common one across Hollywood. However, since yesterday
   it's been causing Mac Pros to slowly crash and refuse to reboot.

   As Variety reports, the movie and TV industry in Los Angeles is
   "sweating" today because the trashcan Mac Pros they rely on to work are
   failing and nobody knows why yet. The Macs are refusing to reboot, with
   the Avid Editors of Facebook group urging people not to turn off their
   Macs as the tweet below show.

     BIG ALERT tonight regarding #Apple, and #MacOS running on the can.
     DO NOT SHUT DOWN!! #AvidEditors #Avid Apparently something is
     corrupting one of the UNIX root level folders. Back up everything,
     not just on the servers is you are in a connected environment. Refer
     to below FB pg pic.twitter.com/iLlfHVRfmp

   In a statement, Avid said it's "aware of the reboot issue affecting
   Apple Mac Pro devices running some Avid products, which arose late
   yesterday. The company also released the video included below to help
   explain the situation and offer some guidance while the problem is
   identified and solved:

   One way to test if your Mac Pro is affected is to go into System
   Preferences and then Users & Groups. If you know your account is set as
   admin, but the preferences only show you as a regular user, your system
   has been compromised and will likely fail to reboot if shut down.

       Bottom Line: Nintendo Switch Online is a necessary subscription if
       you want to play Switch games on the internet. It has classic NES
       and SNES games, as well as Tetris 99, but the way it implements its
       various features can be frustrating.

       at
       Bottom Line: The Olympus Tough TG-6 is a modest update to our
       favorite underwater point-and-shoot camera thanks to its tough
       design, bright lens, and excellent macro capabilities.
     * HTC Vive Cosmos

       Editors' Rating: good 10.03.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The HTC Vive Cosmos VR headset is a technically
       impressive improvement on the original Vive, but it's very
       expensive and you still have to deal with a cable.
     * pCloud
       pCloud
       Editors' Rating: good 10.02.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Cloud storage and syncing service pCloud is reasonably
       priced, supports all major platforms, and offers an extra secure
       option, but it's not as integrated as Google Drive and OneDrive nor
       does it offer as many features.
     * Asustor AS5304T

       Editors' Rating: excellent 10.02.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The Asustor AS5304T is a powerful four-bay NAS device
       equipped with top-notch hardware and a generous catalog of apps.
     * Bose Portable Home Speaker Bose Portable Home Speaker
       Editors' Rating: good 10.02.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The Bose Portable Home Speaker delivers Amazon Alexa
       and Google Assistant voice control with powerful wireless audio for
       its size, if not its price.
     * Apple iPhone 11
       Apple iPhone 11
       Editors' Rating: excellent 10.02.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The iPhone 11 offers solid camera performance and
       power to spare for a relatively reasonable price. It isn't
       exciting, but it's a good replacement for older iPhones.
     * Apple iPhone 11 Pro
       Apple iPhone 11 Pro
       Editors' Rating: excellent 10.02.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The pricey iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max bring more
       cameras, longer battery life, and better LTE capabilities to
       Apple's flagship phone line.
     * Sticky Password Premium

       Editors' Rating: good 10.01.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Sticky Password Premium does everything you'd expect
       from a password manager, though it lacks advanced features such as
       digital inheritance and password breach checks. If you choose its
       secure no-cloud Wi-Fi sync, your passwords never leave your home
       network.
     * Microsoft Teams
       Microsoft Teams
       Editors' Rating: excellent 10.01.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Microsoft Teams provides features galore, including
       tight connectivity with Office 365. It's a great team messaging app
       if your organization is a Microsoft shop.

       Editors' Rating: excellent 10.01.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The GoPro Hero8 Black is the company's best action
       camera to date, offering class-leading stabilization and video
       quality in a rugged, waterproof body.

       4)
       10.01.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Atelier Ryza is a promising Japanese RPG that focuses
       on the joy of adventure and delivers satisfying combat and a robust
       item-crafting system to keep you invested.
     * Samsung Galaxy Fold

       Editors' Rating: good 10.01.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Samsung gets points for innovation with its Galaxy
       Fold. You can use this pricey device as a phone or a tablet, but it
       doesn't quite satisfy in either regard.
     * Philips Brilliance 499P9H

       Editors' Rating: excellent 09.30.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The Philips Brilliance 499P9H offers a winning
       combination of a gigantic, ultra-wide curved screen—shining with a
       bright, vivid image—and extras like a Windows Hello-compatible
       webcam and a built-in KVM switch.
     * Cooler Master MM710 Gaming Mouse

       Editors' Rating: good 09.30.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Cooler Master's MM710 esports mouse is one of the
       lightest things on padded feet for serious twitch gamers, but the
       compact, minimalist design is definitely not for everyone.
