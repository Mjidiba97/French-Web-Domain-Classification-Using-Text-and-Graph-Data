Tips for prepping and packing for Europe

   Leave a Comment

   [img_5972.jpg] Oh Europe. You have without a doubt stolen my heart.

   You see, back when I was a Sophomore in college, my sister and I
   started planning our trip to Europe. We were going to go during the
   summer, and we’re so excited. We were clueless as to where we were
   going to go, but we were going to make it happen! And then something
   big happened in our family that changed our lives, and definitely made
   Europe not a possibility.

   While I was so sad at the time, I’m so thankful that at 32 years old, I
   finally got to go- and with my hubby AND friends!

   AND our time in Spain was all expenses covered by Young Living, so that
   obviously made it really incredible!

   [img_5701.jpg]

   This blog post isn’t going to be an all inclusive guide to Europe. I am
   farrrrr from an expert,  but I will share the things we learned along
   the way. Good and bad.

   First off, our trip was two weeks long. For all the places we wanted to
   see, we could’ve been there for a month, easy. But you see, we have
   three amazing babies at home, so two weeks was definitely our max! And
   at the veryyyy end, we actually were ready to be home.

   We spent almost an entire week in Seville, Spain. That whole portion
   was with our Young Living friends. And then it was just us two for
   Italy. We did Positano, Florence, and just a quick day in Ostia (right
   outside of Rome).

   Writing those words still feels surreal. I can’t believe we got to go
   and experience all of the beauty we did. So thankful.

   [img_6168-1.jpg]

   First let’s talk about what you definitely need to buy before this
   trip!

   –a converter/adapter.  Now listen friend! There is a difference. A LOT
   of products that you need to charge, like Apple products, etc can be
   used in Europe with just using an adapter. The one I linked is great
   because it has a ton of outlets and USB ports!

   –Curling Iron. But if you have a blow dryer, curling iron, or
   straightener that you absolutely insist on bringing, you’ll also need a
   converter. I figured all the hotels would have a blow drier (they did),
   so I skipped that. I did however buy a cheap curling iron here so that
   I could use it with just an adapter instead of having to get a pricier
   converter/adapter. I figured it would be nice to have a cheap one to
   travel with in general, so i went this route. It worked great, and was
   great for peace of mind knowing I wasn’t going to blow a fuse/break my
   regular curling iron.

   One of our hotels actually said they had adapters at the desk if you
   need one, but definitely don’t rely on that. And some of our hotels had
   USB outlets by the bed which was nice for our phones. But again, don’t
   rely on that.

   -Exchange your money. You’ll also want to exchange your money at your
   bank before leaving, in order to get the best exchange rate. There are
   atms all over, AND most (not all!) places accept credit cards, but to
   get the best rate, do it at home.

   Speaking of money, in Florence a lot of stores we shopped at (which it
   might be everywhere, but we didn’t shop in any of our other
   destinations) offered tax free shopping for non-EU residents. You have
   to show them your passport, and they give you a special receipt that
   you take with you to the airport. After checking in, there will be a
   place you can take those receipts and get your money back. It really
   adds up!

   [img_5315-1.jpg]

   Stuff needed for the flight

   –Compressions socks. Another thing you will definitely want to grab
   beforehand is compression socks. They seem unnecessary, but trust me-on
   a flight longer than like 4 hours-you’ll be you have them! Even on our
   11 hour flight from Rome to Dallas, we had no swelling. But it’s not
   just for swelling, it’s to prevent blood clots. I grabbed these from
   amazon and they worked amazing. And when you get to your destination,
   nothing will feel better than taking those bad boys off!

   –Neck Pillow. Get this neck pillow! It worked great, didn’t take up as
   much room as the normal ones, AND is machine washable.

   –Comfy cardigan. this cardigan is pretty cheap and SO soft. You want
   layers upon layers for your flights. Most of our flights were freaking
   freezing, but one was warm. So layer it up! And that Max and Mia
   cardigan is so soft, BUT MAKE SURE to wash it a few times before your
   trip. It sheds like crazy with only one or two washes. Another cardigan
   option thats even more amazing, but more pricey, is this one!

   -Make sure to bring your usb cord for charging your phone. In Premium
   Economy, they provide you with a blanket, eye mask, ear plugs,
   headphones, and even a mini little toiletry set for refreshing. I’m
   honestly not sure what they give you in economy, but we loved all the
   stuff they provided for us.

   -We also made sure we had our thieves wipes and hand purifier available
   at all times, because yuck! I also brought Immupro on the plane for
   helping with sleep! It also boosts your immune system, which is a huge
   bonus! And if you wear contacts, do yourself a favor and bring a case
   with solution already in it, and your glasses. Your eyes will want the
   rest during the flight.

   Safety

   I bought a cute little fanny pack from target for this trip, and I’m so
   glad I did. My phone case blocks radiation, so it already protects
   against people being able to steal your card info, but if you are
   concerned about that, or are knowing you’ll be in unsafe areas-look
   into one of these types of purses. While in the airport, I kept both of
   our passports, my phone, our tickets, chapstick and hand purifier in my
   fanny pack. All the necessities!

   [img_5361.jpg]

   I did wear a purse while walking around sometimes, and felt totally
   safe. If we went to a super crowded area, I was just aware of my
   surroundings and kept the purse in front of me.

   I should pack what?

   Now listen, when I tell you what I packed, know this. I am not a “carry
   on only” type of girl. I would muchhhh rather fill up an entire big
   suitcase and have options while there! It was torture to me to only
   bring one big case and one big backpack. I legit had to just keep
   pulling stuff out while packing. And even then, we we’re wayyy over EU
   limits, but I’ll get to that later!

   I also made sure to bring a good comfy pair of tennis shoes, BUT I also
   brought comfy cute shoes and even a fancier pair. Not every single day
   of our trip was spent walking for miles, so I wanted to be able to have
   some cuter options while there. I brought:

   -1 tennis shoes

   -1 fancier shoes

   -1 comfy sandals

   -1 cute but comfy shoes

   I brought 5 pairs of jeans (one white and one black), and then a bunch
   of tops. I also brought two dresses, one specially for a dress up night
   for YL, and the other for a night while in Positano.

   Last minute the night before we left, I ran to Nordstrom to get a North
   Face jacket (on serious sale, normally like $250, and I got it for
   $80!). I knew I would want something warmer than the couple sweaters I
   was bringing, but all my jackets were seriously bulky and heavy -aka
   your packing worst nightmare. I’m so glad I bought that, because I
   definitely put it to use! If you are going in the summer, obviously not
   an issue, but still bring some sort of layer Incase of cool nights. And
   FOR SURE have a warm sweater for the plane, all our rides were
   freezing!

   I brought yoga pants for my pj bottoms. It was nice because that way I
   could wear them as needed. Wear them to bed, but want some comfy pants
   for that morning? You’re good to go. And only brought 3 PJ tops, and
   just made sure wore them for bed only, and kept them clean.

   We also did do laundry half way through at a local laundry mat. That
   was an experience to say the least. Most places we went, at least
   someone around us knew English. Not here though 😂 and of course we
   forgot to bring euros with us, and she didn’t take cards. It was a
   rocky start, but our clothes got washed for cheap. Our hotels service
   would’ve legit cost us like $300, instead we spent $20. And the laundry
   mat was right next to a restaurant, so we just went and had breakfast
   while they got clean. And most laundrymats have detergent included (not
   an ideal choice of chemicals lol, but it was at least nice not having
   to go and buy that too)

   Ok I think that’s it for packing, now let’s get to the fun stuff in the
   next post. I am going to break it down place by place! Seville, Spain.
   Positano, Italy. Florence, Italy. Ostia, Italy.

Our Most Recent Flip!

   Leave a Comment

   Hi friends! Its been a minute since I have posted about our flips. The
   market has been funky for us when it comes to flips lately, so while we
   used to always have two going at a time, that hasn’t been the case
   recently.

   Which to be honest, I am quite alright with since our life is already
   so crazy, haha. But I know for Jeremy, he is happiest when he has a
   flip that he can use as his creative outlet. So here is our most recent
   one, which was extra sweet to do since it was for some of our closest
   friends.

   We didn’t add on any square footage to this one, just totally gutted
   almost every inch of the inside, took down walls, and moved where a lot
   of spaces were. The outcome made for one beautiful, bright, open home
   for our friends who get to welcome their first little baby in soon!

   But here is how it started:

   And when you walked in, this is what it was:

   And we turned it in to this:

   Its pretty much magic what taking down some walls can do, right?! The
   fun thing with this home was how much original brick was able to be
   saved and showed off! It always blows me away how so many of our flips
   have had the most beautiful brick covered up! Show that off friends!

   The main living space is nice and open and dreamy, and they are now
   having a built-in breakfast nook added for a comfy eat-in space. I love
   that their actual Dining Room space is right off the sliders so once
   its not 100 degrees out, they will be able to fully open them up and
   bring the inside out!

   The original kitchen wasn’t even in this spot, but here is a Before:

   And now, this:

   I mean, can we talk about that island for a second? The counters
   are quartz and look 100% like the real deal of marble, but without the
   insane hassle of keeping that clean and unstained. Which basically is
   my fav thing ever. The kitchen is always the heart of a home, so we
   love focusing big time on that space in a home.

   The Master bedroom was the next biggest transformation of this house!
   It was awesome and big, but so dang random. We kept the fireplace but
   removed the brick and reframed it. And totally transformed the who
   space, just look!

   The Masterbath is freaking glorious with the fireplace, clawfoot tub,
   and massive walk-in shower [that has glass doors, they just weren’t in
   during these photos] haha. And the Master bedroom still has so much
   space, not to mention light because of the French Doors.

   Even the two other bedrooms in the house are stunning. They both got
   lucky enough to have a wall of the original brick in them, so pretty!

   The Guest bathroom was actually not that bad before, but it didn’t
   fully fit the vibe of the rest of the house. Its amazing what a little
   bit of paint/new accessories did for this space!

   And drumroll please….

   The laundry room floors are SO GOOD!

   And while this home is so beautiful now, the design and details are far
   from the best part. The best part is the family that makes this house a
   home now. We always love imagining how a family will use and love our
   homes we flip, so its even more fun when we know and love them. Cannot
   wait to watch them raise their baby boy here, create so many memories,
   cherish the holidays, and hopefully have us over for some dinners;)

   Finally, lets now celebrate that we have a new flip in the works
   already!!!!!!!! Its been a minute, so I am so excited to see whats to
   come!
