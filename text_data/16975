   ingredients like whole grain bread, creamy avocado, and delicious slow
   roasted turkey breast. Ready in just minutes, this toast is a smart
   option that fits into a healthy lifestyle. Itâ€™s the perfect savory

   Turkey and avocados have to be one of my favorite flavor combinations
   right now. The creaminess of the avocado pairs so well with roasted
   turkey flavor. I love recipes that are made with just a few simple
   delicious ingredients and this turkey and avocado toast is definitely
   my new favorite. I love making this recipe on mornings when I wonâ€™t be
   eating lunch for awhile. This toast is satisfying and the best part is
   that it takes just minutes to make.

   I love the textures of all the ingredients in this turkey and avocado
   toast. You get a nice crunch from the whole grain toast, creaminess
   from the avocado, smokiness from the slow roasted turkey breast, and
   a nice spice kick of crushed red pepper flakes and ground black pepper
   to amp up the flavor. Oscar Mayer Selects Natural deli meats contain no
   artificial ingredients, preservatives, flavors, colors, no added
   hormones, no by-products, and no gluten. It simply tastes amazing!

   Start by toasting one piece of whole grain bread either in a toaster or
   on the stove. While the bread is toasting, cut one avocado in half.
   Scoop out one of the halves and place in a bowl. Use a fork to mash the
   avocado. I like to leave some chunky pieces for a nice bite. Squeeze
   one lemon slice over the avocado. This will prevent the avocado from
   browning and it also adds a nice acidic flavor.

   Use a knife to spread the mashed avocado onto the piece of toasted
   whole grain bread. Sprinkle with salt and crushed red pepper flakes to
   taste.
