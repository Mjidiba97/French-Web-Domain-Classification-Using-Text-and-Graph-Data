   Episode Guide

   CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION is drama about a team of forensic
   investigators trained to solve criminal cases by scouring the crime
   scene, collecting irrefutable evidence and finding the missing pieces
   that solve the mystery. The series made DNA a household term to
   millions of fans in over 170 countries who learned the importance of
   blood, saliva and skin as evidence and how those elements help solve
   crimes. After 15 seasons and more than 300 episodes, the CSI team of
   D.B. Russell, Sara Sidle, Greg Sanders, Dr. Albert Robbins, David
   Phillips, David Hodges, Morgan Brody and Henry Andrews welcome back Gil
   Grissom, Catherine Willows and Jim Brass for their final case, when
   they investigate a catastrophic event that paralyzes all of Las Vegas.
   Russell and Sidle will make decisions regarding their crime-fighting
   careers, and the return of Lady Heather will create controversy one
   last time between Grissom and Sidle.

   Episode Guide

   CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION is drama about a team of forensic
   investigators trained to solve criminal cases by scouring the crime
   scene, collecting irrefutable evidence and finding the missing pieces
   that solve the mystery. The series made DNA a household term to
   millions of fans in over 170 countries who learned the importance of
   blood, saliva and skin as evidence and how those elements help solve
   crimes. After 15 seasons and more than 300 episodes, the CSI team of
   D.B. Russell, Sara Sidle, Greg Sanders, Dr. Albert Robbins, David
   Phillips, David Hodges, Morgan Brody and Henry Andrews welcome back Gil
   Grissom, Catherine Willows and Jim Brass for their final case, when
   they investigate a catastrophic event that paralyzes all of Las Vegas.
   Russell and Sidle will make decisions regarding their crime-fighting
   careers, and the return of Lady Heather will create controversy one
   last time between Grissom and Sidle.
