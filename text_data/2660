   opt-in process will you receive our newsletter. At any time, you have
   the right to view your declaration of consent or to unsubscribe from
   the newsletter. Corresponding links are implemented in every cover
   letter to our newsletter. If you unsubscribe from our newsletter, we
   will immediately delete your contact details from our newsletter
   distribution list.

   The effectiveness of an electronic consent, as it is used for the
   registration for the newsletter, is subject to certain requirements by
   law. This also includes recording your declaration of consent. We
   therefore log the date and time of consent, the text of the declaration

   1.4.2.4 MEASURES TO SERVE YOUR PROTECTION

   Among others, we use your personal data in the following cases:

   • We analyse your data to protect you or your company from fraudulent
   activities, This may happen, for example, if you have been the victim
   of identity theft or if unauthorized people have otherwise gained
   access to your user account;

   • Our IT support works closely with you in case of technical problems
   to improve the reliability of our web applications. In this context, we
   also evaluate logs of page accesses, actions performed, etc;

   In order to be able to record and prove facts in the event of possible
   legal disputes.

   1.4.3 ON THE BASIS OF YOUR CONSENT

   If you have consented to the processing of your personal data for one
   or more specific purposes, we may process your data. You can withdraw
   this consent at any time for the future without incurring any costs
   other than the transmission costs according to the basic tariffs (costs
   of your Internet connection). However, the withdrawal of consent does
   not affect the legality of the processing up to the withdrawal.

   1.4.4 DUE TO LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OR IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST

   As a company, we are subject to a wide variety of legal requirements
   (e.g. from tax legislation). In order to comply with our legal
   obligations, we process your personal data.

   1.5 WHERE WE TRANSMIT DATA AND WHY

   1.5.1 USE OF DATA WITHIN IPC

   Within IPC only those entities that need your personal information in
   order to fulfil our contractual or legal obligation or to protect our
   legitimate interest will have access to them.

   1.5.2 USE OF DATA OUTSIDE IPC

   We respect the protection of your personal data and we pass on
   information about you only if required by law, if you have given your
   consent or to fulfil contractual obligations.

   For the following recipients, for example, there is a legal obligation
   to pass on your personal data:

   • Public authorities or supervisory authorities, e.g. tax authorities,
   customs authorities;

   • Judicial and law enforcement authorities, e.g. police, courts, public
   prosecutors;

   • Lawyers or notaries, e.g. in legal disputes;

   • Chartered Accountant/ Auditors.

   In order to fulfil our contractual obligations, we cooperate with other
   companies. These may include:

   • Transport service providers and freight forwarders;

   • Organisers and training service providers, if you have registered
   through us for certain trade fairs or events;

   • Banks and financial service providers to handle all financial
   matters.

   Our own service providers

   In order to make our operations more efficient, we use the services of
   external service providers who may receive personal data from you for
   the purposes described, including IT service providers, printing and
   telecommunications service providers, debt collection, consulting or
   sales companies.

   Important: We pay close attention to your personal data!

   In order to ensure that the service providers comply with the same data
   protection standards as in our company, we have concluded appropriate
   contracts for order processing. These contracts regulate, among other
   things:

   • that third parties only have access to the data they need to carry
   out the tasks assigned to them;

   • that the service providers only grant access to your data to
   employees who have explicitly committed themselves to comply with data
   protection regulations;

   • that the service providers comply with technical and organisational
   measures that guarantee data security and data protection;

   • what happens to the data when the business relationship between the
   service provider and us is terminated

   For service providers based outside the European Economic Area (EEA),
   we take special security measures (e.g. by using special contractual
   clauses) to ensure that the data is treated with the same level of
   caution that is exercised in the EEA. We regularly check all our
   service providers for compliance with our specifications.

   Very important: Under no circumstances do we sell your personal data to
   third parties!

   1.5.3 USE OF DATA WITHIN IPC, WORLD PARA SPORTS AND INTERNATIONAL
   AFFILIATES

   In order to provide you with the best possible service, we occasionally
   exchange data within the IPC, WORLD PARA SPORTS and International
   Affiliates. We guarantee that the applicable data protection
   regulations are observed and that your personal data is adequately
   protected at all times.

   For this reason, we have taken appropriate measures to ensure
   compliance with data protection within the IPC Group:

   We have concluded appropriate contracts with the individual
   subsidiaries to ensure that personal data shared within the Group
   remains protected at all times.

   In accordance with these contracts and applicable data protection laws,
   we transfer personal data to our production and sales subsidiaries only
   for the purposes stated in this data protection statement. In doing so,
   we support our subsidiaries both in their operations and in their
   compliance with the technical and organizational measures that we also
   use at the parent company to guarantee the security of your personal
   data. If possible, we protect your data by using pseudonymisation or
   anonymisation measures. If subsidiaries are located outside the EEA, we
   take appropriate measures to ensure that the personal data processed
   there is just as protected as within the EEA.

   1.6 ARE YOU OBLIGED TO PROVIDE US WITH PERSONAL DATA?

   In the context of the business relationship between you and IPC, we
   require from you the following categories of personal data:

   • all necessary data for the establishment and implementation of a
   business relationship;

   • data required for the fulfilment of contractual obligations;

   • data that we are legally obliged to collect.

   Without these data it is not possible for us to enter into or execute
   contracts with you.

   1.7 DELETION PERIODS

   In accordance with the applicable data protection regulations, we do
   not store your personal data longer than we need for the purposes of
   the respective processing. If the data is no longer required for the
   fulfilment of contractual or legal obligations, it will be regularly
   deleted by us, unless its temporary storage is still necessary. There
   may be the following reasons for further storage:

   • Obligations under commercial and tax law to retain data must be
   observed: The periods for storage, primarily in accordance with the
   provisions of the Commercial Code and the Fiscal Code, are up to 10
   years.

   • To obtain evidence in the event of legal disputes within the
   framework of statutory limitation periods: in civil law, statutory
   limitation periods may be up to 30 years, with the regular limitation
   period occurring after three years.

   1.8 YOUR RIGHTS

   Within the scope of processing your personal data, you also have
   certain rights. More detailed information can be found in the
   corresponding provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation
   (Articles 15 to 21).

   1.8.1 RIGHT TO INFORMATION AND CORRECTION

   You have the right to obtain information from us on which of your
   personal data we process. If this information is not (no longer)
   correct, you can ask us to correct the data, or, if it is incomplete,
   to complete it. If we have passed on your data to third parties, we
   will inform the relevant third parties in the event of a corresponding
   legal situation.

   1.8.2 RIGHT TO DELETION

   You can request the immediate deletion of your personal data under the
   following circumstances:

   • When your personal information is no longer needed for the purposes
   for which it was collected;

   • If you have revoked your consent and there is no other legal basis
   for data processing;

   • If you object to the processing and there are no overriding
   legitimate reasons for data processing;

   • If your data is processed unlawfully;

   • If your personal data must be deleted in order to comply with legal
   obligations.

   Please note that before deleting your data we must check whether there
   is not a legitimate reason for processing your personal data.

   1.8.3 RIGHT TO RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING ("RIGHT TO BLOCK")

   You may request us to restrict the processing of your personal data for
   one of the following reasons:

   • If you dispute the accuracy of the data until we have had the
   opportunity to verify the accuracy of the data;

   • If the data is processed unlawfully, but instead of being deleted,
   you merely request the restriction of the use of personal data;

   • If we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of
   processing, but you still need them to assert, exercise or defend in
   the course of legal claims;

   • If you have filed an objection against the processing and it is not
   yet clear whether your legitimate interests outweigh ours.

   1.8.4 RIGHT TO OBJECT

   1.8.4.1 RIGHT OF OBJECTION IN INDIVIDUAL CASES

   If the processing is carried out in the public interest or on the basis
   of a balance of interests, you have the right to object to the
   processing for reasons arising from your particular situation. In the
   event of an objection, we will not process your personal data further,
   unless we can prove compelling reasons for processing your data, which
   outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or because your personal
   data serve to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. The objection
   shall not preclude the legality of the processing carried out up to the
   time of the objection.

   1.8.4.2 OBJECT AGAINST THE USE OF DATA FOR ADVERTISING PURPOSES

   In cases where your personal information is used for advertising
   purposes, you can object to this form of processing at any time. We
   will no longer process your personal information for these purposes.

   The objection can be made form-free and should be addressed to:

   have given us for processing in a transferable and machine-readable
   format.

   1.8.6 RIGHT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT WITH A SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY (ART. 77
   GDPR)

   We try to process your requests and claims as quickly as possible in
   order to protect your rights appropriately. Depending on the frequency
   of enquiries, however, it may take up to 30 days before we can provide
   you with further information about your request. If it should take
   longer, we will inform you promptly of the reasons for the delay and

   permissible, we will inform you of the reason for refusing to disclose
   the information.
