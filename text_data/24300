Pretty nice game

     So this game is pretty nice it’s honestly a great game but I’m
     fixing to spill some tea so get all them paper towels ready. OK so
     around about when the game first came out I thought it was pretty
     cool I actually deleted the game eventually because all the ads but
     I decided I would re-download it now i’m glad to see that you fixed
     the problem this game is really fun to play and I actually am
     addicted to it now I wouldn’t say it’s good for a 4-year-old but I
     would say it’s good for around 6 and up just my opinion with how
     difficult it is I feel like 4 -year-olds wouldn’t really understand
     as good as an older kid but hey who knows we have some smart kids
     these days. And to any parents this game is a very good to keep your
     kid occupied trust me they can spend hours on it trying to beat 1
     Little level I feel like they can add more color though it’s just
     very bland this game is very fun and I do recommend it I wouldn’t
     say deserves a whole 5 but it’s pretty funny I feel like little kids
     would get so much laughter out of this game and it’s really fun to
     challenge people. So that’s just what I think of this game of course
     my opinion is different to other peoples but I recommend you reading
     my little ramble before you download it anyway bye.

Good but could Improve please read

     I believe this game is awesome, it’s so fun and I really recommend
     getting it! But, there do have to be some minor changes to the game
     at least in my opinion. I hate that almost every time you fall over,
     there is ads. It really disappoints you, and you don’t want to play
     the game anymore. But, I get why there is ads you guys need money.
     Maybe you can still give those ads but in a different way. If you
     had a mini game for example, you could give ads there. The mini game
     could be about all the minis you collect or like, I don’t know a
     story line. I know you guys most likely will not change what you are
     doing because you have been doing these things for years but I think
     more people would get the app and you could get more money from the
     ads. But, just my thought. Thank you for reading

   Not Anyone. , 05/16/2019

Please read this before getting the game!

     Alright, here we go.
     i love this game. it’s pretty fun and challenging, and I enjoy the
     whole, daily, “collect the little daddy long legs” thing. I enjoy
     this game as much (if not slightly more) as the next guy.
     Now, you might be wondering “well, if you love this game so much,
     what’s with your 3-star review?”. Well let me get started on that.
     When I first got into this game a long while ago, around when it
     came out, it was absolutely awesome! I tried to beat my friends and
     relatives’ high scores, but I wasn’t too good at the game and
     failed, but I had a fun time trying. Anyways, it was all fun and
     peachy.
     Then, I stopped playing for quite a while. I lost interest because,
     frankly, there isn’t much to do. You walk, you fall, you buy
     costumes. Maybe there could be some other objective too! I mean, add
     a side game or something! I know about the whole Horse part, but
     that’s not enough. It’s the same idea.
     But that isn’t the reason i came here today. No, it is not.
     So, i lost interest for a while, but recently i was deleting some
     apps and decided to go try this game again. It was pretty fun! Same
     as before, unfortunately, but fun. But EVERY SINGLE ROUND, you get
     an ad!
     Like, “welp. you fell over. now watch this little commercial about
     Walmart! oh, you missed a part? don’t worry, you’ll see it again in
     three seconds when you fall again.” There’s way too many adds. at
     least have it be every like, five or ten rounds.

Editors’ Notes

   Like an ultra-modern Frogger, One More Dash is all about strategic
   pauses between frantic bursts of motion. Visually minimalist, this
   addictive game propels you between rounds as you simply tap the screen
   to advance between circles. But it’s not so easy—each one is barricaded
   behind a moving obstacle that requires perfect timing to slip past. The
   pure joy of design made simple—set to a frenetic pace—turns out to be
   completely irresistible.
   netdzynr , 07/29/2015

Great, But Needs A Bit More

     To echo what others have written, One More Dash is a fun and
     challenging time waster that looks great. The pace and physics
     behaviors are well tuned, making for satisfying gameplay. But the
     gameplay does get repetitive for the reasons stated in other
     reviews. The challenges simply increase the numbers of tasks to
     complete, and the order of spinning circle types is repetitive.
     Rewards should increase as challenges increase in difficulty. The
     game could seriously use some powerups -- something to break up the
     monotony and add to the value of earning points and "rings". There
     are little behavior gems that pop up now and then, such as
     rebounding back a few circles without dying, but these are too few
     and too intermittent. Regardless, One More Dash is a very
     entertaining title, and hopefully the developers are working on an
     update to make this great game even greater.

   Sorry not allowed , 06/04/2015

Very good game

     This game is very simple, yet challenging. It has fun, and smooth
     gameplay. The app itself does have ads but it's not annoying like
     most free apps. This app is perfect except for one little thing. The
     missions that you get assigned get harder and harder, but the reward
     remains the same throughout the game. It would make more sense that
     as you get more difficult missions, you get a higher reward. Other
     than that, this app doesn't need any changes :)

Best Pixel fighting game but...

     The game is very cool and funny...kinda reminds me of sumotori
     dreams...but there is a glitch in the music where durning a fight
     the music will start...but then at a random part in the song it will
     just stay at that part and play it over and over again each
     second...it gets very annoying...but still a fun game...maybe add
     more game modes like an “all boss mode” where there is only
     bosses...and your also a boss...or maybe a “sandbox mode” where you
     can spawn whoever when ever...change characters to different sizes
     including yourself...and change gravity...so basically music bug
     fix...and ideas...keep up the good work

   Mottaty , 11/10/2016

A Suggestion

     New update: minor bug fixes
     I guess that means completely revamping the jump physics?
     Personally, I've grown to love the old physics (but not the old
     old). I think the less-jump mechanic makes the game more controlled,
     which can take away a lot of the fun. If you like this jump style a
     lot though, maybe make an option to toggle how the jump physics
     work? I'm sure I'm not the only one to want it. Other than that,
     still my favorite app (along with Dunkers), keep up the good work :)

   Wizard 101 for mobile please , 04/18/2017

FUNNIEST GAME EVER

     I love this game it's hilarious and fun AF. I love the weird physics
     that make the stuff look funny . You finally made a game that is a
     high score game with tons of replay ability always different way to
     keep you entertained. this game has made my day. This also has
     screen recording which is a plus and no BS with the in app
     purchases. You sir deserve a high five man. I don't know if there
     are ads because of my ad blocker. This game deserves more attention
     with its quality.

     pour les discutions a l’autre bout du monde et les faux profils qui
     afflue en balle de je ne sais où ? Du jamais vu. LOVOO et SMAX, sont
     les meilleurs applications de France pour voire des profils fake et
     des femmes qui recherche que de la discutions enfin bref, vous
     devriez faire une annonce auprès du pôle emploi, histoire d’engager
     des détectives privé façon modérateurs pour éradiquer les pollueurs
     de Fake profil qui envoie des copiées coller pour des plans cul sur
     WhatsApp ou Gmail, je sais que les temps sont dure mais là vous avez
     atteint le sommet de la dégradation de votre Application qui sert
     plus à rien à part espérer rentabiliser l’état et votre site. Je
     sais que les temps sont dure mais quand même !!! Faite le trie
     niveau fake parce que eux ce sont des escroc qui viennent souvent
     des pays d’Afrique. Alors attention je ne suis pas raciste mais un
     profil qui donne un numéro de tél avec un WhatsApp et un Gmail faut
     vraiment être torcher Rahbta pour mordre à l’hameçon sa date pas

     sur tous les profils afin de nous signaler ces comportements.

SIGNALEMENTS INJUSTES!

     Bannissement parce que je n’ai répond pas à toutes les femmes qui
     m’abordent. Et oui celles-ci m’ont signalés simplement parce que je
     ne leur répondais pas. Du coup je supprime l’application c’est
     vraiment du harcèlement et c’est injuste. En plus bannissement de
     6mois, c’est clair que vous n’êtes pas prêt de me revoir! 🤬🤬😡

Réponse du développeur ,

     Bonjour, le bannissement ne fait pas suite à des signalements pour
     non réponse.
