Driving the mobility revolution

   Mobility Revolutions
   Vehicle electrification
   Autonomous Vehicle
   Digital Mobility

   We have entered a new era. The challenges of rapid urbanization across
   the world coupled with environmental issues are creating new forms of
   mobility. New technologies are providing solutions that are reshaping
   our cities, our lifestyles and the way we travel. Always a pioneer and
   tech leader, Valeo has been able to anticipate the changes redefining
   the auto world. The Group is already inventing tomorrow’s mobility by
   positioning itself at the heart of the three revolutions that are
   shaping the auto sector: electrification, automation and smart
   mobility. Valeo's four business divisions are constantly innovating to
   offer technologies that make vehicles cleaner, safer, more efficient,
   accessible and tailored to everyone’s needs.

   By 2030, hybrid and electric cars are expected to account for one-third
   of global automotive production as demand for combustion engines
   declines. A pioneer and world leader in the field of vehicle
   electrification, Valeo already equips one out of every three cars in
   the world with electrical systems that reduce CO2 emissions. Its
   innovative technologies cover all types of motorization - from low
   voltage and light hybridization to high voltage full-electric.

   While half of the planet live in cities and the world’s population
   continues to grow, urban densification creates many challenges, notably
   in terms of the mobility of goods and people. Autonomous driving will
   help alleviate traffic and increase safety by reducing the risk of
   collision. Valeo is world-leader in producing sensors that enable
   vehicles to understand their environment. The Group is also preparing
   for new uses, with the autonomous and connected vehicle becoming a
   platform of services more than just a mere means of transport.

   Digitalization and hyper-connectivity are disrupting usage and
   reinventing mobility. A pioneer in the sector, Valeo is committed to
   anticipating the needs of tomorrow, be it autonomous driving, the
   development of community-based models (carpooling, carsharing,
   chauffeur-driven transport) or smart cities and their “always on the
   move’ citizens. The Group’s mission? Create technologies that serve
   people’s needs.

   Mobility Revolutions Mobility Revolutions

Au cœur des révolutions de l’automobile

   Révolutions de l’automobile
   Électrification du véhicule
   Véhicule autonome
   Mobilité digitale

   Une nouvelle ère est en marche. L’urbanisation croissante, partout dans
   le monde, et les enjeux environnementaux se conjuguent au même moment
   pour redessiner de nouvelles formes de mobilité. Les nouvelles
   technologies apportent des solutions qui conduisent à refaçonner nos
   villes, nos habitudes et nos modes de déplacement. Précurseur et leader
   technologique, Valeo a su anticiper ces changements. Le Groupe invente
   d’ores et déjà la mobilité de demain en se plaçant au cœur des trois
   révolutions qui bouleversent le secteur automobile : l’électrification,
   l’automatisation et la mobilité intelligente. Les quatre pôles
   d’activités de Valeo innovent constamment pour offrir des technologies
   rendant les véhicules plus propres, plus sûrs, plus efficaces,
   accessibles à tous et adaptés à chacun.

   À l’horizon 2030, les voitures hybrides et électriques devraient
   représenter un tiers de la production automobile mondiale alors que la
   demande en moteurs à combustion recule. Pionnier et leader mondial en
   matière d’électrification des véhicules, Valeo équipe déjà une voiture
   sur trois dans le monde en systèmes électriques permettant de réduire
   les émissions de CO2. Ses technologies innovantes couvrent tous types
   de motorisation - de l’hybridation légère basse tension au
   tout-électrique haute tension.

   Alors que la moitié des habitants de la planète vit en ville et que la
   population mondiale continue de croître, la densification urbaine pose
   de nombreux défis, comme celui de la mobilité des biens et des
   personnes. La conduite autonome permet de fluidifier le trafic et de
   renforcer la sécurité en réduisant le risque de collision. Valeo est
   leader des capteurs permettant aux véhicules d’appréhender leur
   environnement. Le Groupe se prépare aussi aux nouveaux usages, le
   véhicule autonome et connecté étant amené à devenir une plateforme de
   services plus qu’un simple moyen de transport.

   La digitalisation et l’hyperconnectivité bouleversent les usages et
   réinventent la mobilité. Pionnier dans le secteur, Valeo s’attache à
   anticiper les besoins de demain, qu’il s’agisse de la conduite
   autonome, de l’essor des modèles communautaires (co-voiturage,
   autopartage, transport avec chauffeur) ou de la ville intelligente et
   ses citoyens en mouvement. La mission du Groupe ? Créer des
   technologies au service des usagers.
