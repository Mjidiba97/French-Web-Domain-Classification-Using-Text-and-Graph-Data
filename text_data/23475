   Hi everyone, happy Monday! I am not ready for the week even after a
   4-day weekend. My weekend was long, fun and so relaxing.

   I wore this out on 4th of July. Kate Spade tee, striped shorts and horn
   necklace, Anthro shades.

   and this was my 4th of July dinner from Rocco’s Tacos.

   I changed into these chiffon printed shorts and v-neck tee, along with
   comfy wedges to walk in.

   I made egg Benedicts with sweet potatoes for breakfast, I pretty sure I
   gain 5 pounds this past weekend.

   These accessories have been on repeat since I’ve gotten them. (shades /
   turquoise bracelet / gold rope bracelet / horn necklace / pave necklace
   / envelop clutch-on sale for $39)
   Accessories Accessories

   Love this GAP tee so much and decided to do a little print mixing with
   a striped skirt, avis, double strand necklace and these sandals are so
   comfortable.

   Ok don’t judge me, my snack is half healthy ok… I just love cheese
   puffs at least these are organic.

   Found a new way to organized my bracelets, everything is visible. This
   organizer is from the container store.

   These are my latest acquisitions, and I just realized they all had
   studs. I swear I did not do this on purpose. J.Crew – Schutz –

   Dinner I made, bbq pork chops, potatoes and brocoli it was pretty
   yummy.

   Ran errands in this baseball tee, denim short, rumbatime watch and
   white kicks.

       You look soooo cute in all of these outfits! And I’m kind of
       obsessed with your Kate Spade tee, there really is nothing like
       cake for breakfast. Yum! BTW, all this food looks so delish, you
