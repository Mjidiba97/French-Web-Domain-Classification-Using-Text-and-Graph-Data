   I have been a member of WPMUDev for a year now. I am not sure how I
   survived in the wordpress world before joining. I am not a newbie, but
   I am not a tech geek either. Before joining wpmudev, when I had a
   serious wordpress issue - or stuck in any way, i just sat there for
   days spinning wheels, trying to find solutions. I had no technical
   people in my circle to run ideas by or benefit from their experience.
   As a member of WPMUDEV I have a full technical team of experienced
   wordpress users at my disposal. My questions and my issues are
   responded to within hours in most cases which is worth the money right
   there. They also provide over 250 plugins and 100's of themes that have
   been tested and all work together in unison, and someone on their team
   is familiar with everyone - If you are a wordpress developer/designer
   -- a wpmudev membership is worth double the low price they charge ---

   I have been a with WPMUDev community for an year now. We run a
   wordpress only company and WPMUDEV is great hand for us. As a member of
   WPMUDEV I have a full technical team and whenever I hit an issue I
   could get the solution from their forum. My questions are valued by the
   forum members and so it makes us more interested to continue with them.
   Their plugins always make us secure and will solve most of our
   wordpress needs - from signup TOS to Multisite network. Join WPMUDEV,
   you have a team to back you!

   wpmudev.org good resource for designer and developers. Lots of useful
   tools. A bit pricey but some may be able to justify the price.

   WPMUDEV is one of the best sites out there. I purchased a three month
   membership to try it out and I will now be purchasing a year
   membership. It is well worth the money to have your fingers at
   everything WPMU has to offer. Then you combine there customer service
   with that and the site is hard to beat. I really enjoy the forums as
   well. I have learned so much from just reading what others are trying
   to do and how WPMU has helped them with there websites. I would
   recommend this site to my best friend and that is saying a lot cause I
   normally do not recommend anything to any one. WPMUDev has proven
   itself to do and be exactly what they say they are. The best wordpress
   theme and plugin site there is for the money. Thanks WPMU for all your
   help and guidance. You really are the best.

   I have been testing WPMU DEV plugin and themes for almost a year before
   using them in a production environment and I am very pleased with the
   functionality, security, and support I have received. Ultimate
   Branding, Ultimate Facebook, Pro Sites, New Blog Templates (especially
   with multisite), Domain Mapping, Multi DB and the all important anti
   spam tools have been most useful to me. Ease of installation and lack
   of conflicts between various plugins is vital to me and with these
   particular plugins I have had no issues whatsoever. Any minor issues
   that have cropped up have been dealt with quickly by the support team
   who seem to be awake 24/7

   I highly recommend WPMU DEV, I am just starting out and they have
   excellent service and great value. I anticipate a long and prosperous
   partnership...
   localbuzzsquadSat Jan 17 1970
   Everyday I get pitched with offers to join the ultimate WordPress
   membership groups. Everyday new plugins are being offered online as the
   ultimate WordPress plugin and must have tool. The truth is for the last
   12 months I have depended heavily on one resource online, WPMUDEV and
   their premium membership. Okay no one is perfect, after all we are
   talking about software development, coding and supporting the constant
   ongoing WordPress updates. BUT . . . WPMUDEV is really right up there
   to being perfect, its that game rating of 9.89, we don't give them a
   9.99 or 10 because we want to push them to the edge and get them to
   deliver even more amazing plugins, lol. On the serious side, if you
   depend on WordPress as your website development platform for your own
   personal business or as a consultant to your clients, then WPMUDEV is
   the number one solution out there. Sure you can find all sorts of
   different individual membership programs that support WordPress and
   plugin development, but you will never ever find an all-in-one
   powerhouse like WPMUDEV. I have looked out there and I have to be
   upfront and say I can not recommend a single membership that delivers
   like WPMUDEV. Look, we depend on WordPress and Plugins to make our
   websites do magic for our clients and for our own personal business
   websites. The fact you have access to over 300 plus premium WordPress
   plugins with support from both the develops/staff at WPMUDEV and
   thousands of peers, is just unheard of these days. Unless you want to
   dish out a few thousand dollars a month to get the same level of
   development and support. The WPMUDEV team is there 24/7 and they also
   offer 7 days a week live support that starts at 6am right up to 8:30
   pm. Everyday and each live session provides you with access to a top
   level support member and with one on one support in the various areas
   of development, plugin solutions and troubleshooting. You can speak
   with experts who will help with WordPress and Buddy Press issues, web
   design issues, plugins and coding, the list is huge. The deal is
   simple, why would you want to give money to a bunch of no name plugin
   developers who sell the latest trendy plugins, who use poor coding
   methods, that any good programmer would never put their name to the
   code. Then you get the hyped price and pressure sales pitch they throw
   at you. Oh yeah! we are not going to charge $595 or $495 or $295 . . .
   we are giving you this amazing piece of junk for $97. The truth is its
   not worth even $20 and a few month s down the line when WordPress
   updates its code the plugins all fail or mess up your website, worse,
   they mess up your client's website. There is ZERO hype from WPMUDEV, no
   sales pitch, no hyped up plugin offers and no let down. The plugins and
   themes work, if there is a problem they will go out of their way to fix
   it. If you have ideas to improve the plugin, tell them and if its
   something they can do they will. The bottom line for me is that I
   depend on the professional team at WPMUDEV. I depend on the support and
   the team spirit from all the peers who become like this amazing network
   of friends, I like to think of it as having a core team or family all
   over the world that is there to help when help is needed. Over the
   years WPMUDEV has stood it ground in providing quality plugins and
   support. They have a huge team of customers which means they are not
   going to suddenly vanish. The cost of being a member at WPMUDEV is
   priceless and if you are not part of the team, then you are really
   missing out on one of the world's most amazing WordPress plugin
   development / support memberships. Do I have a WPMUDEV tattoo on my
   rear end, not yet, but getting serious about it . . . lol

   I am really grateful for the products and SUPPORT I get at WPMU DEV. I
   ask millions of questions and they are always positive, helpful, and
   get me the answer I need. It's truly a great and unique community of
   varying skill sets ready to help me make my dreams come true in the
   online world. I have never taken a programming or coding class but with
   the hands on support of WPMU DEV, I've been able to build wordpress
   sites with advanced functionality. It's a really awesome company.
   daviddaviesSat Jan 17 1970
   Definitely a quality site, awesome team too :)
   Dawson.BarberSat Jan 17 1970
   WPMU offers great value to anyone doing anything with WordPress. They
   have an awesome selection of plugins that are always kept up to date
   and offer multi site support, so they really go the extra mile to make
   sure their products are as universally usable as possible. I don't use
   their themes - I prefer to do my own - but they have a huge selection
   of these, too, so if you're looking for a nice theme for your WordPress
   site, WPMU is definitely worth checking out. And then there's their
   support. All I can say is that they are extremely quick to respond and
   always bend over backwards to help out. I highly recommend them.
