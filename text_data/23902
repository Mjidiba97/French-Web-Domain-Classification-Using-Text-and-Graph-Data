The privacy policy of the LiquidM Technology GmbH in accordance with the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

   This Privacy Policy applies to the web services and websites of
   LiquidM Technology GmbH, Invalidenstr. 74, 10557 Berlin, Germany,
   represented by Philipp Simon and Thomas Hille, hereinafter referred to
   as LiquidM. “This Privacy Policy is always to be regarded as part of
   the respective web presence which directly refers to this site (e.g.
   under “Privacy” or “Privacy Policy”).

   As a controller in accordance with the EU General Data Protection
   Regulation (“GDPR”), LiquidM takes the protection of your personal data
   very seriously. We would like to inform you about when we collect what
   data and how we use it. We have implemented extensive technical and
   organizational measures (Art. 32 GDPR) to ensure compliance with and
   adherence to applicable provisions on data protection and data security
   by LiquidM and as well contracted third party providers. Please note
   that amendments to this Privacy Policy may be required due to the
   ongoing development of our websites and the implementation of new
   technologies to improve our web services. We, therefore, recommend
   frequently referring back to this Privacy Policy and reading through
   the current up-to-date version, which is always available online under
   https://www.liquidm.com/privacy-policy.

   I. WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?

   According to Art.4 No. 1 GDPR, personal data is any information
   relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, therefore can
   be used to obtain personal or factual details about the data subject
   (such as name, address, telephone number, date of birth or e-mail
   address). Information that cannot (directly or indirectly) be
   associated with a natural person (or only with disproportionate
   effort), for example, anonymous information, is not personal
   information.

   II. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND PROCESS?

   You can use a portion of our online content without providing personal
   information.

   a) Contact forms

   If you, however, decide to request further information via the contact
   forms provided on our website, we may ask for your name and further
   personal information in order to handle your personal request or to
   provide the services you requested from us or our customers. You can
   freely decide whether or not you want to provide that information.
   However, without this information, we are unable to make the desired
   services available to you.

   b) User account (LiquidM Platform)

   Certain services of our Online-Service called “LiquidM Platform” with
   which you can create and display advertising campaigns on your own,
   upload list of advertising IDs for retargeting campaigns and specify
   targeting criteria for your campaigns, can only be used by registered
   users with a user account. We store your e-mail address during
   registration. The e-mail address serves as a username to identify your
   member account, and to conduct relevant correspondence with you (e.g.
   setting up and maintaining your user account). As part of the
   registration process, we also collect your first and last name, your
   salutation and information about your company affiliation, mailing
   address, to ensure that you receive personalized, competent service.
   All mandatory information required in order to register is marked
   accordingly. All further information is provided voluntarily; this data
   is used for the purposes stated, or to improve our online services.

   By registering with our websites, you declare your agreement with the
   General Terms and Conditions of LiquidM and the use of your
   abovementioned personal information in accordance with this Privacy
   Policy.

   If you wish to register as a user of our LiquidM App and open a user
   account, please select for your own safety a secret and secure password
   in order to ensure the confidentiality of your data. Your password is
   transmitted to and stored on our servers in encrypted form, in the
   event that you forget your password, please use the “Forgot your
   password?” function provided on the website to create a new, secure
   password.

   If you want to delete your account, please contact us at
   info@liquidm.com. If deletion is not possible for legal reasons, access
   to the data in question shall instead be blocked. Please note, however,
   that we may be unable to continue offering some or all of the services
   provided on our websites requiring registration in the event that your
   data is deleted or blocked.

   c) LiquidM newsletter

   As part of our web services, we offer a regular subscription to our
   LiquidM newsletter. When requested, the newsletter provides you with
   free, up-to-date information on our services. To register without
   LiquidM newsletter service, we need your first and last name, your
   gender, and the e-mail address at which you wish to receive the
   newsletter. If you wish to subscribe to the LiquidM newsletter, we ask
   that you provide us with the following declaration of consent:

   I would like to regularly receive the LiquidM newsletter and agree that
   my e-mail address, my first and last name, and my gender, as well as
   any data voluntarily provided, be used for this purpose. I can revoke
   this declaration of consent at any time by using the “Opt-Out function”
   in the respective LiquidM Newsletter or via an e-mail notice to
   newsletter@liquidm.com, as well as by writing to LiquidM GmbH,
   Invalidenstr. 74, 10557 Berlin, Germany, such revocation to take effect
   for the future. No additional fees beyond the normal transmission fees
   of my e-mail or Internet provider shall apply. In the event that my
   consent is revoked, I shall not, or shall no longer, be able to receive
   the LiquidM newsletter. I have read and accepted the current privacy
   policy.

   III. DELIVERY OF PERSONALISED OR BEHAVIOUR-BASED ADVERTISING
   (BEHAVIORAL TARGETING)

   In certain cases, we showcase advertising to you on the websites of our
   partners and for our customers, which are automatically selected on the
   basis of your surfing behaviour, in order to optimise the quality of
   the advertising notices for you (so-called “personalised” or
   “behaviour-based” advertising delivery and “behavioral targeting”). The
   objective of this system is to only demonstrate to you content that
   corresponds to your interests. Advertisements which are unlikely to be
   of interest to you or which are irrelevant will not be shown to you by
   the activated behavioral targeting system of LiquidM and will be
   disabled.

   In such a case, this section IV. of the data protection declaration
   applies as part of the respective web-based services of our partners or
   customers, from which (for example under “data protection” or “data
   protection declaration” direct reference was made or a link was
   created. We wish to disclose to you in a transparent manner how the
   behavioral targeting works, which data is gathered in the process, how
   this data is used and for what purpose and how you can object to the
   behavioral targeting function at any time and block it.

   As a German/European company, the protection of your data is a priority
   for LiquidM, also in the course of the delivery of behavior-based
   advertising and LiquidM only uses anonymized data to improve advert
   quality. Therefore, an identification of your person is not possible
   either for LiquidM or the respective operator of the website of our
   partners and customers which you are visiting. You can yourself decide
   at any time whether you would like to continue seeing the personalized
   banner from LiquidM.

   a) How does behavioral targeting work in individual cases?

   We take part in a programmatic auction system where placements for
   advertisement in apps and websites are sold. In this process, we may
   collect information about you and your use of the website or app. This
   information cannot be used to identify you in real life but it does
   enable us to recognize your device when you use sites or apps that have
   partnered with us.

   Another way we may deliver personalized advertising to you is when you
   visit the website of one of our partners or customers. On some of these
   sites, a cookie file is stored on your computer. Cookies are small text
   files which are deposited by your web browser in a folder on your
   computer which is designated for this purposes and which contains a
   single character string as a means of identification. (The cookie does
   not store your IP address.) The same character string is also saved on
   our servers. The next time you visit one of our partners’ websites,
   only the character string is read which identifies the Internet browser
   you are using. This allows us, for example, to identify which page you
   have accessed for our partner and which advert you have been shown,
   without this being linked to your identity. Furthermore, all of the
   cookies created by us are given an expiry data and automatically expire
   after no more than 13 months. Without a valid cookie file, the
   character strong saved on our servers is no longer to be assigned for
   us.

   Important: Using cookies we cannot ever collect any other personal
   data. For example, when you enter an email address or delivery address,
   or any other personal data, we cannot see your input and cannot,
   therefore, process or store it. We do not know your name, address or
   workplace, nor do we know your gender, age, email address or any other
   personally identifiable information about you. Even the IP address of
   your computer is not stored! You can view the data stored in the cookie
   on your computer. Please refer to your web browser’s help directory or
   your web browser’s FAQ to learn how cookies are stored and how to read
   their content. The information contained within the cookie is the exact
   data that we can see Cookie technology does not allow viruses, trojans
   or other harmful programs to be placed on your computer.

   A full list of the cookies used by LiquidM and their individual
   functions can be downloaded here at any time. Should you not agree to
   the saving of cookies on our part, you can examine your cookie status
   at the very top of this page at any time, and also deactivate the
   saving of behavioral targeting cookies by us. Therefore you can object
   to the personalized adverts from LiquidM at any time.

   b) How can I disable personalized advertising from LiquidM banners?

   If you do not agree to the storing of cookies by us, you can check your
   cookie status at any time at the very top of this page and disable the
   storage of retargeting cookies by us and therefore decline personalized
   adverts from LiquidM.

   This means that in future you will receive random advertising that is
   not targeted to your interests.

   Please note that the “opt-out” and “opt-in” functions offered are, for
   technical reasons, also controlled via cookies. This means that
   deleting all cookies on your computer means that you will have to
   opt-out again.

   It is also the case that the deletion of all cookies on your computer
   does not lead to no personalized advertising being notified to you on a
   permanent basis. Therefore, you must use the  “opt-out” function as
   described.

   Finally, please note that we are continuously expanding our range of
   products. As this will technically involve a new system, the
   introduction of a new opt-out may be necessary, even if you have
   already opted prior to its introduction.

   c) Can other forms of personalized advertising be disabled in addition
   to LiquidM?

   The options described in this section refer only to the personalized
   adverts offered by LiquidM. If you wish to disable personalized
   advertising from other providers, you can do this via their respective
   websites.

   There is an option to change your settings collectively for various
   providers under preference management on “Your Online
   Choices”: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/.

   If you want to opt-out from the usage of the Advertising ID, please
   refer to your operating system settings, or follow the instructions
   below:

   Android Users (version 2.3 and above) To use the “opt-out of
   interest-based advertising” option, follow the instructions provided by
   Google here: Google Play Help.

   iOS users (version 6 and above) To use the “Limit Ad-Tracking” option,
   follow the instructions provided by Apple here: Apple Support Center

   Please note that these are device settings and will disable
   interest-based ads from all providers, and not just for us

   d) We also collect information about the advertisements that have been
   served to you by LiquidM and match them we the Advertising ID from the
   programmatic buying process.

   Information about the ads can contain:
     * the details of the ad delivered (e.g. advertiser’s name, type of
       advert, etc);
     * the website or the app where the ad was delivered;
     * your interaction with the ad (i.e. whether you clicked, hid, muted
       or otherwise interacted with the ad);
     * whether you performed certain actions after clicking on the ad
       (e.g. downloading an application, making a purchase, etc).

   e) How do we use collected information?

   We use the information we collect to display interest-based advertising
   customized to individuals’ inferred interests, preferences and
   locations, and to perform analysis aimed at improving our services and
   technologies. We also need the information in the billing process with
   our customers and to validate the billings we receive from our
   partners. The information we collect also helps us to provide filtering
   options for publishers and developers to manage ads appearing on their
   sites and in their apps, and to provide targeting options for
   advertisers. In the end, this helps publishers and developer clients,
   for example, not to present you ads that you have already seen, and
   helps our advertiser clients serve adverts that are most likely to be
   of interest to you.

   Important: We do not store the IP-Addresses un-anonymized or the
   Geographic location

   IV. ANONYMOUS DATA/USE OF COOKIES

   We also use cookies on the LiquidM websites. Cookies are small text
   files, stored by your web browser in a dedicated directory on your
   computer or mobile device. Cookies are solely used to identify your web
   browser in an anonymous manner. Our cookie files only contain
   automatically generated ID numbers and a time stamp. We neither know
   your name, the place you live or work nor do we know your gender, your
   age, your e-mail address or any other similar information about you.
   The IP address of your device will also not be stored. You can view the
   data stored in the cookie on your computer. Please refer to your web
   browser’s help directory to learn how cookies are managed. The
   information contained within the cookie is the exact data that we can
   see Cookie technology does not allow viruses, trojans or other malware
   to be placed on your computer.

   You can also use our websites without the use of cookies enabled. Most
   browsers accept cookies automatically. You can disable the storage of
   cookies or set your browser to notify you before accepting the storage
   of cookies. Please note that users who do not accept the storage of
   cookies may not be able to access certain functionality of our
   websites, or can only use our websites with considerable difficulty.

   Further information and a full list of the cookies which are used by
   LiquidM on its own websites or on those of customers or partners, as
   well as their individual functions, can be downloaded here at any time.
   In addition, you can generally prevent the storing of cookies by
   adjusting your browser settings accordingly.

   V. LEGAL BASIS

   The legal bases for the processing of your data could be the following:
     * Your consent to the use of data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit.
       a) GDPR;
     * The performance of our service obligations arising from contracts
       concluded with you in order to provide the services you request in
       accordance with Article 6 (1) lit. (b) GDPR;
     * Our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR,
       e. g.
          + Our business interests in improving our services so that we
            can better understand your needs and expectations and thus
            improve the services we provide to you;
          + To prevent fraud and to ensure that our websites are used
            completely and without any fraudulent behavior;
          + To ensure and guarantee the security of our services, making
            sure that our offer is technically secure and properly
            functioning;
          + to ensure and enforce our contractual requirements and claims.
     * Legal reasons in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. c) GDPR if the
       collection, storage, transfer or other processing of data is
       prescribed by law or processing is necessary to fulfill our legal
       obligations.

   VI. DATA STORAGE

   We store personal information you submit to us only for as long as is
   necessary to fulfill the purposes for which such information was
   transmitted, or as required by law:
     * If you conclude contracts with us, we store and process your
       personal data for the duration of the contractual relationship and
       beyond for the fulfillment of post-contractual obligations and
       handling of issues as well as for the duration of statutory
       retention periods (maximum 10 years);
     * If you have consented to the promotional use of your e-mail
       address, we will store your e-mail address with our mail service
       provider until you unsubscribe, requesting us to delete the data;
     * If you send us an inquiry, we process your personal data while we
       handle your request.

   VII. IS PERSONAL INFORMATION FORWARDED TO THIRD PARTIES?

   We forward your Advertising ID  we received from our Partners to
   companies running the advertising campaigns on our service or companies
   providing anonymous audience data in case we register that you saw one
   of our advertisements or in case you clicked on an advertisement. This
   is only done for billing and statistical reasons. In certain cases, we
   are also required by law to disclose your personal information to third
   parties. This is, for example, the case when the suspicion of a
   criminal offense or a misuse of our websites occurs. We are then
   required to disclose your data to law enforcement authorities.

   Outside of the cases described in this data protection declaration,
   your data is not forwarded on to third parties and, your information is
   solely stored in our databases / on our servers (or on the servers of
   third-party providers).

   VIII. HYPERLINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

   In addition, our websites contain hyperlinks to websites offered by
   third parties When clicked, the hyperlinks redirect you from our
   website directly to the website of another provider. You can recognize
   this redirection process by the change of the URL in your web browser’s
   address bar. If you have been forwarded to the website of a cooperation
   or promotional partner, the use of your personal information will only
   be subject to the privacy policy of the relevant provider. We cannot
   take any responsibility for the privacy practices of third parties´
   websites because we do have no control over their compliance with data
   protection regulations.

   IX. PROTECTION OF MINORS

   Persons under 18 years are excluded from our services and from
   providing any personal information without the consent of their parents
   or guardians. We do not request personal information from children and
   adolescents. We do not knowingly gather or collect such data and do not
   disclose it to third parties.

   X. HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE

   When we collect information, we solely store your data on highly
   protected servers in Germany and the EU. Access to our IT
   infrastructure is strictly limited to authorized persons who are
   involved in the technical, commercial or editorial support.

   In order to avoid loss or misuse of data stored by us, we have taken
   all necessary and extensive technical and organizational safety
   precautions, which are regularly checked and updated based on
   technological advancements in accordance to the GDPR.

   However, we would like to inform you that because of the nature of the
   Internet, the provisions of data protection and data security measures
   described in this Privacy Policy may not be observed by any third
   parties or institutions beyond our control. Especially unencrypted data
   transmission – even when sent via e-mail – can be read by third
   parties. We have no technical influence on this. The user has the
   responsibility to protect the information he provides from misuse by
   encryption, selection of a secure password or other means.

   XI. RIGHTS OF THE “DATA SUBJECT” ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF THE GDPR:

   According to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, you deserve the
   right to request access to your personal data (see Art. 15), as well as
   rectification (see Art. 16), erasure (see Art. 17) or at least
   restriction of processing (see Art. 18) of your personal data.

   Furthermore, you have a right to data portability (see Art. 20) and, of
   course, the right to revoke any consent given to the processing of
   personal data at any time (see Art. 7) and to object to processing
   based on the balancing of legitimate interests (see Art. 21(4) GDPR).
   In addition, you have a right to appeal to the competent data
   protection supervisory authority.

   If you have any questions or other feedback on the subject of data
   protection or would like to exercise your rights regarding data
   protection, please contact our Data Protection Officer or ourselves:
