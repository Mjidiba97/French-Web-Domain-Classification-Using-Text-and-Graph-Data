Amazon Mechanical Turk

Access a global, on-demand, 24x7 workforce

   Get started with Amazon Mechanical Turk

   Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a crowdsourcing marketplace that
   makes it easier for individuals and businesses to outsource their
   processes and jobs to a distributed workforce who can perform these
   tasks virtually. This could include anything from conducting simple
   data validation and research to more subjective tasks like survey
   participation, content moderation, and more. MTurk enables companies to
   harness the collective intelligence, skills, and insights from a global
   workforce to streamline business processes, augment data collection and
   analysis, and accelerate machine learning development.

   While technology continues to improve, there are still many things that
   human beings can do much more effectively than computers, such as
   moderating content, performing data deduplication, or research.
   Traditionally, tasks like this have been accomplished by hiring a large
   temporary workforce, which is time consuming, expensive and difficult
   to scale, or have gone undone. Crowdsourcing is a good way to break
   down a manual, time-consuming project into smaller, more manageable
   tasks to be completed by distributed workers over the Internet (also
   known as ‘microtasks’).

Benefits

Optimize efficiency

   MTurk is well-suited to take on simple and repetitive tasks in your
   workflows which need to be handled manually. Using MTurk to outsource
   microtasks ensures that work gets done quickly, while freeing up time
   and resources for the company – so internal staff can focus on higher
   value activities.

Increase flexibility

   Scaling up and down a workforce isn’t the easiest undertaking. With
   access to a global, on-demand, 24x7 workforce, MTurk enables businesses
   and organizations to get work done easily and quickly when they need it
   – without the difficulty associated with dynamically scaling your
   in-house workforce.

Reduce cost

   MTurk offers a way to effectively manage labor and overhead costs
   associated with hiring and managing a temporary workforce. By
   leveraging the skills of distributed Workers on a pay-per-task model,
   you can significantly lower costs while achieving results that might
   not have been possible with just a dedicated team.

How it works

   MTurk offers developers access to a diverse, on-demand workforce
   through a flexible user interface or direct integration with a simple
   API. Organizations can harness the power of crowdsourcing via MTurk for
   a range of use cases, such as microwork, human insights, and machine
   learning development.
   How MTurk Works

Use Cases

Building, managing, and evaluating Machine Learning workflows

   MTurk can be a great way to minimize the costs and time required for
   each stage of ML development. It is easy to collect and annotate the
   massive amounts of data required for training machine learning (ML)
   models with MTurk. Building an efficient machine learning model also
   requires continuous iterations and corrections. Another usage of MTurk
   for ML development is human-in-the-loop (HITL), where human feedback is
   used to help validate and retrain your model. An example is drawing
   bounding boxes to build high-quality datasets for computer vision
   models, where the task might be too ambiguous for a purely mechanical
   solution and too vast for even a large team of human experts.

   “At AI2, we're pushing the state of the art of Artificial Intelligence,
   which often requires human-annotated data to train new systems and
   measure our progress. In particular, we use crowdsourcing platforms
   such as Amazon Mechanical Turk to build datasets that help our models
   learn common sense knowledge, which is often necessary to answer basic
   questions that are easy for humans but still quite hard for machines.
   Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a flexible platform that enables us to
   harness human knowledge to advance machine learning research.”

   – Michael Schmitz, Director of Engineering, Allen Institute for AI

Business process outsourcing

   A large, seemingly overwhelming task can sometimes be transformed into
   a set of smaller, more manageable microtasks that can each be
   accomplished independently. Crowdsourcing can be an efficient
   organizational strategy to harness innovation and agility by
   distributing work to Internet users. Businesses or developers can use
   MTurk to access thousands of on-demand workers—and then integrate the
   results of that work directly into their business processes and
   systems. Common examples include the moderation of web and social media
   content, categorization of products or images, and the collection of
   data from websites or other resources.

   “The F&B industry has always operated at the mercy of changing tastes
   and preferences of consumers. Our goal is to surface consumer insights
   and spot emerging trends, so our clients can effectively respond with
   effective strategies. Workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk respond to our
   requests to gather information from menus, websites, and other
   channels. We are able to leverage these human collective insights to
   better understand customer needs and uncover important market trends.”
