Print and Pattern Highlights from Haute Couture Fall 2019

   By Patternbank On July 12, 2019 · In Catwalks

   The Patternbank team have selected some hot picks from Fall 2019 Haute
   Couture runway shows. Check out the rest of the best of Couture Fall
   2019 here.
   Viktor & Rolf Haute Couture Fall 2019

   Guo Pei’s theatrical array of eclectic costumes ranged from Renaissance
   style gowns to corseted Kimonos and from grand ecclesiastical robes to
   wide Marie Antoinette style Pannier skirts. This collection was
   cleverly connected with a neutral colour palette and were all adorned
   with intricate embellishments and structural embroideries. In stark
   contrast, colour and crafty texture were key ingredients in Viktor &
   Rolf’s Couture collection. Densely felted fabrics and patched vintage
   remnants depicted scenes and sunrises and pictorial embellished skirts
   came complete with embroidery hoops.

   not, if you have a passion for fashion or just a love of textiles, you

   to snatch a ticket that is! Currently sold out, with only a handful of
   “first come first served” tickets available on the day, the
   exhibition’s popularity has lead to an extension until 1st September.

   to enjoy!

Print and Pattern Highlights from Haute Couture Fall 2019

   By Patternbank On July 12, 2019 · In Catwalks

   The Patternbank team have selected some hot picks from Fall 2019 Haute
   Couture runway shows. Check out the rest of the best of Couture Fall
   2019 here.
   Viktor & Rolf Haute Couture Fall 2019

   Guo Pei’s theatrical array of eclectic costumes ranged from Renaissance
   style gowns to corseted Kimonos and from grand ecclesiastical robes to
   wide Marie Antoinette style Pannier skirts. This collection was
   cleverly connected with a neutral colour palette and were all adorned
   with intricate embellishments and structural embroideries. In stark
   contrast, colour and crafty texture were key ingredients in Viktor &
   Rolf’s Couture collection. Densely felted fabrics and patched vintage
   remnants depicted scenes and sunrises and pictorial embellished skirts
   came complete with embroidery hoops.

     *

   Whether the opulent gowns of Christian Dior are you usual cup of tea or
   not, if you have a passion for fashion or just a love of textiles, you
   will be wowed by the V&A‘s current exhibition. If you’re lucky enough
   to snatch a ticket that is! Currently sold out, with only a handful of
   “first come first served” tickets available on the day, the
   exhibition’s popularity has lead to an extension until 1st September.
   If that’s all too much like hard work, we’ve taken a few shots for you
   to enjoy!

Print and Pattern Highlights from Haute Couture Fall 2019

   By Patternbank On July 12, 2019 · In Catwalks

   The Patternbank team have selected some hot picks from Fall 2019 Haute
   Couture runway shows. Check out the rest of the best of Couture Fall
   2019 here.
   Viktor & Rolf Haute Couture Fall 2019

   Guo Pei’s theatrical array of eclectic costumes ranged from Renaissance
   style gowns to corseted Kimonos and from grand ecclesiastical robes to
   wide Marie Antoinette style Pannier skirts. This collection was
   cleverly connected with a neutral colour palette and were all adorned
   with intricate embellishments and structural embroideries. In stark
   contrast, colour and crafty texture were key ingredients in Viktor &
   Rolf’s Couture collection. Densely felted fabrics and patched vintage
   remnants depicted scenes and sunrises and pictorial embellished skirts
   came complete with embroidery hoops.

Christian Dior at the V&A Museum – Designer of Dreams

   By Patternbank On April 5, 2019 · In Inspiration
     *

   Whether the opulent gowns of Christian Dior are you usual cup of tea or
   not, if you have a passion for fashion or just a love of textiles, you
   will be wowed by the V&A‘s current exhibition. If you’re lucky enough
   to snatch a ticket that is! Currently sold out, with only a handful of
   “first come first served” tickets available on the day, the
   exhibition’s popularity has lead to an extension until 1st September.
   If that’s all too much like hard work, we’ve taken a few shots for you
   to enjoy!

Print and Pattern Highlights from Haute Couture Fall 2019

   By Patternbank On July 12, 2019 · In Catwalks

   The Patternbank team have selected some hot picks from Fall 2019 Haute
   Couture runway shows. Check out the rest of the best of Couture Fall
   2019 here.
   Viktor & Rolf Haute Couture Fall 2019

   Guo Pei’s theatrical array of eclectic costumes ranged from Renaissance
   style gowns to corseted Kimonos and from grand ecclesiastical robes to
   wide Marie Antoinette style Pannier skirts. This collection was
   cleverly connected with a neutral colour palette and were all adorned
   with intricate embellishments and structural embroideries. In stark
   contrast, colour and crafty texture were key ingredients in Viktor &
   Rolf’s Couture collection. Densely felted fabrics and patched vintage
   remnants depicted scenes and sunrises and pictorial embellished skirts
   came complete with embroidery hoops.

Print and Pattern Highlights from Haute Couture Fall 2019

   The Patternbank team have selected some hot picks from Fall 2019 Haute
   Couture runway shows. Check out the rest of the best of Couture Fall
   2019 here.
   Viktor & Rolf Haute Couture Fall 2019

   Guo Pei’s theatrical array of eclectic costumes ranged from Renaissance
   style gowns to corseted Kimonos and from grand ecclesiastical robes to
   wide Marie Antoinette style Pannier skirts. This collection was
   cleverly connected with a neutral colour palette and were all adorned
   with intricate embellishments and structural embroideries. In stark
   contrast, colour and crafty texture were key ingredients in Viktor &
   Rolf’s Couture collection. Densely felted fabrics and patched vintage
   remnants depicted scenes and sunrises and pictorial embellished skirts
   came complete with embroidery hoops.
