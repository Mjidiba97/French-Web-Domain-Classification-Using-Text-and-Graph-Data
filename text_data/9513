Privacy Policy

I Introduction

   video intelligence AG (“vi”) is the owner of the website located at
   www.vi.ai (the “Website”). This policy (this “Privacy Policy”)
   describes the personal information we may collect from you when you
   access or use our Services, and how we may use that information.

   By having provided your consent to these terms you allow us to process
   your personal data to the extent the purposes of processing have been
   explained to you in this policy.

   For questions specifically concerning this Privacy Policy or our use of
   your Personal Information, cookies or similar technology, please
   contact us by email at legal@vi.ai. You may also write to us at the
   following address: vi video intelligence AG, Mühlebachstrasse 70,
   CH-8008 Zürich, Switzerland.

   This policy is current as of 25 May 2018 and implements the changes
   required by the EU’s Directive 2016/679 (“GDPR”).

Personal Information.

   Personal information is information that can be associated with a
   specific person and could be used to identify that specific person
   (“Personal Information”). Personal Information does not include
   information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can
   no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or
   otherwise, to identify a specific person (“Non-Personal Information”).
   We may sell Non-Personal Information to third parties from time to
   time.

   Personal data is furthermore defined by EU Directive 2016/679 as
   follows:

   ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or
   identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural
   person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in
   particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
   identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or
   more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
   economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;


   Legal basis for data processing

   Within the EU and for EU customers the legal basis for data processing
   is Article 6, sections (a), (b), and (c) of EU Directive 2016/679
   (“GDPR”).

   For customers outside of the EU the legal basis for data processing are
   our Terms & Conditions of service provisioning. The security of data
   for EU and non-EU customers is safeguarded by the same high standard of
   our ISO 27001/27018 compliant combined DPMS/ISMS.

   For customers in Switzerland the legal basis for data processing is the
   Federal Data Protection Act.
