Privacy

Neverware.com Privacy Policy

Our Privacy Policy Summary

   At Neverware, your privacy is critical to us. We prize transparency as
   one of our core company values; accordingly, we strive to be as
   transparent as possible about the personal information we collect and
   how we use it. Updates in this version of the Neverware Privacy Policy
   reflect recent changes in data protection laws, including the General
   Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

   Our policies for privacy and data protection can be summarized as:
     * We only collect data in order to improve the customer experience
       for Neverware’s products and services.
     * We will never sell any of your personal data.
     * When your data is shared with third-party tools and services, it
       remains under Neverware’s control.
     * Our goal is to meet or exceed the legal requirements for personal
       protection in any jurisdiction, and to provide all users and
       customers the same rights.

What This Policy Covers

   This policy is intended to help you understand:
     * What information we collect about you
     * How we use the information we collect
     * How we share information we collect
     * How long we keep this data
     * How to access and control your information

   This Privacy Policy covers the information we collect about you when
   you use our websites, products or services, or otherwise interact with
   us (for example, by registering for our online events or downloading
   our content), unless a different policy is displayed. This Privacy
   Policy is incorporated into, and considered a part of, the Neverware
   Terms of Service, currently located at https://www.neverware.com/tos.

   Please also note that co-branded websites (websites where Neverware
   presents content together with one or more of our business partners)
   may be governed by additional or different privacy statements. Please
   refer to the privacy statement on those websites for more information
   about applicable privacy practices.

   This policy also explains your choices regarding how we use information
   about you. Your choices include how you can object to certain uses of
   information about you and how you can access and update certain
   information about you. If you do not agree with this policy, do not
   access or use our products or services or interact with any other
   aspect of our business.

The Personal Information We Collect

   1. CloudReady Operating System

   CloudReady is provided to users and customers for use on their own
   devices as a full operating system. In this section, “CloudReady OS”
   refers to that OS once you have started using it on your device.

   What data CloudReady OS collects and what we use it for:
     * Hardware Info: We collect data about the devices you run CloudReady
       OS on, including the names, manufacturers, and capabilities of each
       computer and its components. We use this info to provide a unique
       ID for licensing purposes (on CloudReady Education and Enterprise
       Editions), to estimate the volume of total CloudReady users at any
       time, and to better understand and improve CloudReady's
       compatibility with different hardware.
     * Startup and Login Metrics: Neverware tracks the frequency with
       which CloudReady devices are powered on or logged in, and pairs
       that with info about the version of CloudReady a device is running.
       This info allows us to estimate the total number of CloudReady
       users over any given time span, and to infer the stability of
       CloudReady in conjunction with hardware data.
     * Feature Info: Neverware also collects data about your use of some
       specific features like Flatpaks applications and Docker (currently
       only on the Home Edition of CloudReady).

   Personal privacy and opting out on CloudReady OS:
     * Personal Privacy: Hardware and usage data are only tied to your
       device’s identity. No personally identifiable information is
       collected. For Home Edition users, hardware identity is
       pseudonymized using a cryptographic hash to ensure anonymity.
     * Opting Out: All collected data is required by Neverware to be able
       to enforce licensing and provide support on CloudReady Education
       and Enterprise Editions. Users of the Home Edition can opt out of
       sending data at any time in their CloudReady settings menu.

   How long we keep the data that CloudReady OS collects:
     * CloudReady OS does not collect any personally identifiable
       information, and as such, Neverware retains the above device
       information indefinitely for the purpose of historical reporting.


   2. CloudReady feedback tool

   The CloudReady feedback tool sends robust system logs to Neverware, at
   a user’s discretion, in the case of disruptive OS errors such as kiosk
   app failures, licensing issues, sign-in errors, or any time a user
   manually selects “Report an issue” in the browser settings menu.

   What data the CloudReady feedback tool collects and what we use it for:
     * System Logs: We collect a full suite of system logs from your
       CloudReady device when you send us information using the feedback
       tool. For an example of what data is contained in these logs, visit
       this knowledge base article. We use this broad set of data to
       provide our support and engineering team as much context and
       information as possible when addressing the problem that initiated
       the CloudReady feedback tool’s use.

   Personal privacy and opting out of the CloudReady feedback tool:
     * Personal Privacy: System logs redact all your personally
       identifiable information except your email address, should you
       choose to include it.

   You can view the logs you have sent to Neverware by sending a request
   to [email protected]. Education and Enterprise users can also visit
   my.Neverware.com to access their site’s logs.
     * Opting Out: If you do not want to share system logs with
       CloudReady, you are not required to send us system logs. You can
       cancel or avoid any sending of logs by never pressing “alt+shift+i”
       when using CloudReady, never selecting “Report an issue…” from the
       CloudReady settings menu, and cancelling any prompt that asks you
       to send logs.

   Note that some OS functionality is not possible if you choose not to
   send us logs. Licensing errors can only be resolved by sending
   Neverware logs or by contacting our support team, so that the issue can
   be understood and resolved. If you experience a licensing error and
   choose not to send logs, you will not be able to proceed using
   CloudReady.

   How long we keep the data that the CloudReady feedback tool collects:
     * Neverware retains logs you send us for 30 days by default. If your
       logs are relevant to an ongoing investigation or improvement, we
       retain these logs for the duration of the work they are relevant
       to.

   You can request to have your logs deleted by sending a request to
   [email protected].

            Events. Neverware may use your personal information to notify
            you about product and service offerings as well as events that

            personal information to respond directly to your requests for

   inconsistent with the purpose of its original collection, unless you
   have consented.

       example, to provide our services by way of co-branded or private
       labelled websites or to enter into reseller agreements.
     * To monitor certain activities—for example, a user’s movements
       around the site, such as the date and time of your visit, details
       of the information collected through cookies and other tracking
       methodologies, including but not limited to your IP address, domain
       name, browser type, operating system and the solutions and
       information for which you searched. We also monitor activities as
       part of our compliance procedures and to combat fraud.
     * To administer our site, including to ensure that the content is
       relevant and presented to you in the most effective manner.
     * To comply with our legal obligations, including to comply with
       relevant laws and to respond to subpoenas, warrants or other
       requests served on Neverware anywhere in the world or to protect or
       defend the rights or property of Neverware or its users.

   We also post customer testimonials on our site that may contain
   personally identifiable information. We obtain the customer's consent
   via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along
   with their testimonial.  If you would like your testimonial removed,
   please contact us at [email protected].

   Regardless of any choices you make regarding your personal data (as

   in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with
   relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on
   Neverware; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of Neverware
   or users of the site or services.

   portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a
   prominent notice on our site of any change in ownership or uses of your
   personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your
   personal data.

   Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not sell, trade,
   share, or rent the personal data collected from our site and services
   to third parties other than as outlined in this policy.

How to View, Correct, or Delete our Data About You

   We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your
   personal data. If you sign up for our mailing lists or otherwise
   initiate an action with us while acting in an individual capacity (and
   not as the representative of a business or organization), we may
   periodically send you free newsletters and emails that directly promote
   the use of our site or the purchase of our products and services,
   subject to your consent if you are based in the EEA. When you receive
   newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a
   preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you
   will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe
   instructions provided in the email you receive or by contacting us
   directly. Despite your indicated email preferences, we may send you
   notices of any updates to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy.

   Your other rights

   If you are based in the EEA, please see the section below to review
   your choices regarding your Personal Data Data Subject Rights.

   Otherwise, you may change any of your Personal Data in your account by
   sending an email to us at the email address set forth below.  You may
   request deletion of your account information by us by sending an email
   to [email protected], but please note that we may be required (by law
   or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep
   this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with
   your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).
    We will endeavor to respond without delay. We will otherwise retain
   your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to
   provide you Services as well as is necessary to comply with our legal
   obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

   EEA Data Subject Rights

   If you are based in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have
   several data subject rights in relation to how we use your information.

   In addition to the options outlined in the section directly prior,
   under certain conditions, you may have the right under EU data
   protection laws to ask us to:
     * provide you with further details on how we use and process your
       Personal Data
     * provide you with a copy of your Personal Data that we hold
     * update any inaccuracies in the Personal Data we hold
     * delete Personal Data we no longer have grounds to process
     * restrict how we process your Personal Data while we consider an
       inquiry you have raised

   In addition, under certain conditions, you have the right to:
     * where processing is based on consent, withdraw the consent at any
       time. If you withdraw your consent, it will not affect the
       lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal
     * lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
     * object to any processing of Personal Data that we process on the
       “legitimate interests” or “public interests” grounds, unless our
       reasons for the underlying processing outweigh your interests,
       rights and freedoms; and
     * object to direct marketing (including any profiling for such
       purposes) at any time
     * transfer your information to another provider, known as the right
       to data portability

   If you would like to exercise these rights, email us at
   [email protected]. We will endeavor to respond without delay. We may
   need to ask you additional clarifying questions in order to accurately
   respond to your request. If we are unable to deal with your request
   fully within one month (due to the complexity or number of requests),
   we may extend this period by a further two months. Should this be
   necessary, we will explain the reasons why.

   These rights are subject to certain exemptions to safeguards to
   safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or the detection of
   crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). We
   will respond to most requests within one month.

   If we are unable to resolve a query or a complaint, you also have the
   right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator/
   supervisory authority in the country in which you are based.

   Residents of California

   Our users who are California residents may request and obtain from us
   once a year, free of charge, certain information about the Personal
   Data (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing
   purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this
   information would include a list of the categories of Personal Data
   that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with
   which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
   If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request,
   please submit your request to [email protected].

   Children’s Online Privacy

   Neverware’s products and services are not directed to children and
   Neverware does not knowingly collect online personal information from
   children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a
   minor under the age of 13 and believe that he or she has disclosed
   personal information to us, please contact us at [email protected].

   Fair Information Practices

   The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
   law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
   significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
   globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
   they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
   privacy laws that protect personal information.

   In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, we will take
   the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
     * We will notify you via email within 20 business days
     * We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires
       that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
       rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to
       the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
       enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
       have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate
       and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
