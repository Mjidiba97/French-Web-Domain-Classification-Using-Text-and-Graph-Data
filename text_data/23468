   Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein has been a free man,
   despite sexually abusing dozens of underage girls according to police
   and prosecutors. His victims have never had a voice, until now. By

   A decade ago, during a brief stint in Palm Beach County Jail, convicted
   sex offender Jeffrey Epstein made an odd purchase at the facility‚Äôs
   store: two pairs of small women‚Äôs panties, size 5.

   It was just one of thousands of dollars of purchases made by the
   disgraced financier while in jail after pleading guilty in 2008 to
   soliciting a minor for sex, according to a purchase log. (His top
   purchase was single-serve cups of coffee, of which he bought more than
   800 in 13 months.) But the panties raise questions about why a
   childless male inmate, accused of sexually abusing girls as young as
   14, would be allowed to buy female undergarments so small that they
   wouldn‚Äôt fit an average-sized adult woman.

   The panties were certainly too small for Epstein, who also purchased
   his briefs in men‚Äôs medium and sweatshirts ranging from XL to 3XL, and
   size 12 shoes. So what, or who, were they for, and why wouldn‚Äôt the
   purchase raise eyebrows under the circumstances? It‚Äôs one of many
   questions that arise from thousands of pages of records obtained by the
   Miami Herald from the Palm Beach County Sheriff‚Äôs Office.

   The stockade held male and female inmates, separately, explaining why
   the panties were stocked.

   On Friday, the Palm Beach Sheriff‚Äôs Office, which runs the jail and
   stockade, handed out the records of his stay, during which he was
   allowed to leave the stockade in a chauffeur-driven car and deposited
   at a downtown West Palm Beach office building for a 12-hour-a-day,
   six-day-a-week respite from incarceration.

   The records came out too late Friday to get a comment from Sheriff Ric
   Bradshaw or his spokeswoman. Bradshaw has faced increasingly fierce
   criticism ‚Äî and his department is now under investigation by the
   Florida Department of Law Enforcement ‚Äî for its seemingly soft
   treatment of the multimillionaire hedge fund manager, who was,
   according to the records, allowed to wander in and out of his unlocked
   cell at will.

   That investigation is separate from the Justice Department probe
   looking at why then-federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta decided to
   shelve a 53-page sex trafficking indictment against Epstein, which
   could have put him away for life.

   Listen to today's top stories from the Miami Herald:

   And now there is yet another pending investigation, this one looking at
   how Epstein, rearrested at 66 in early July on renewed sex trafficking
   charges, was able to hang himself last Saturday in a New York City jail
   cell while awaiting trial. The new charges were filed after the Miami
   Herald published a series on Epstein‚Äôs 10-year-old case, Perversion of
   Justice, that examined, among other things, Acosta‚Äôs decision to give
   in to a defense demand that victims not be told about the earlier
   federal charges being dropped.

   The Manhattan cell where he took his own life ‚Äî in a hardscrabble
   lockup notorious for bugs, rodents and rough jail mates ‚Äî was a stark
   contrast to his surroundings in Palm Beach County in 2008.

   What‚Äôs clear from the Palm Beach sheriff‚Äôs records is that Epstein‚Äôs
   wealth provided him extraordinary privileges during his 13-month stay
   in the Palm Beach stockade from June 30, 2008, to July 22, 2009 ‚Äî an
   unlocked cell door, almost unlimited access to a TV, and a perhaps
   uniquely generous work release program that meant he spent almost as
   much time outside the jail as in it.

   The longer he stayed, the cushier things got. Six-day-a-week work
   release was extended to seven. Hours outside the cell were extended
   from 12 to 16. He was permitted to pass some of the time at home.
   Records that once referred to him as an inmate now called him ‚Äúclient.‚Äù

   Deputies, required to wear business suits, provided ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù for
   Epstein while he was on work release. They guarded the door to his
   office or home, sometimes from the outside, rather than keeping an eye
   directly on Epstein, while the inmate was on structured leave from the
   jail. Some deputies expressed relief in their daily reports that he
   seemed pleased with services rendered.

   The records from Palm Beach suggest the local sheriff‚Äôs office never
   intended to treat the convicted sex offender as a typical inmate ‚Äî
   explicitly because of his extraordinary wealth.

   In an email on the day Epstein reported to jail, Capt. Mark Chamberlain
   wrote that the new inmate was a person of ‚Äúunusual means‚Äù and expressed
   concerns that other prisoners might try to extort or manipulate him.

   ‚ÄúHis financial status lends itself to his being victimized while in
   custody and as such, he has been placed in special management,‚Äù
   Chamberlain wrote. ‚ÄúHe is poorly versed in jail routine and society and
   his adjustment to incarceration will most likely be atypical. For the
   time being, I am authorizing that his cell door be left unlocked and he
   be given liberal access to the attorney room where a TV will be
   installed.‚Äù

   All this while serving time for soliciting sex with a minor ‚Äî a charge
   Epstein agreed to plead guilty to only after Acosta, then the U.S.
   attorney for Southern Florida, killed an already drafted
   sex-trafficking indictment that could have put him away for life.

   During his stint in Palm Beach County custody, Epstein was required to
   be physically present in the jail for about 60 percent of the time
   during the 13 months he served, far less time than originally reported
   by PBSO when questioned by the Miami Herald and other media outlets.
   According to calculations based on internal emails describing his work
   release, Epstein was approved to spend over 40 percent of the time at
   his office, at home, or at a variety of doctor appointments.

   Bradley Edwards, an attorney for some of the women who accuse Epstein
   of having recruiters lure girls to his Palm Beach estate for massages
   that turned into sexual assaults, has alleged that Epstein used his
   work release hours to engage in sexual exploits behind closed doors. A
   release of court records earlier this month quoted a young female
   college student allegedly recruited by Epstein‚Äôs associates saying he
   required ‚Äúthree orgasms a day‚Äù to function. ‚ÄúIt was biological. Like
   eating,‚Äù she said Epstein told her.

   The record of who visited Epstein while on work release ‚Äî a daily log
   maintained by deputies and tucked away in a safe ‚Äî has been destroyed.
   Explaining that decision, the sheriff‚Äôs office cited legally prescribed
   retention schedules that allowed for the book‚Äôs destruction. But many
   records from that time remain for investigators to examine, including
   the thousands of pages of just released records.

   The records provided Friday list every deputy assigned as plainclothes
   ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù for Epstein during his work release. The deputies, paid for
   by Epstein, are potential witnesses in what is an ongoing Florida FDLE
   investigation of Epstein‚Äôs treatment by PBSO and its longtime sheriff,
   Bradshaw.

   Purchase records from the jail‚Äôs commissary are a reflection of the
   hedge fund manager‚Äôs eclectic personal habits, which included an
   insatiable sweet tooth, and a focus on physical appearance and personal
   hygiene. The prisoner‚Äôs purchases, $2,000 worth in all, included
   hundreds of snacks, from large Hershey‚Äôs almond bars to Sour Cheddar
   Ruffles, hair gel, seven bottles of shampoo, and 22 tubes of
   toothpaste.

   Early during his jail stretch, one of Epstein‚Äôs paralegals was caught
   bringing Epstein a book titled ‚ÄúFace Exercises that Prevent Premature
   Aging.‚Äù Someone also smuggled in more hygiene products, including three
   additional tubes of toothpaste ‚Äî brands that weren‚Äôt available on the
   jail shelves. All of that was confiscated as contraband, records show.

   After three and a half months in the stockade, Epstein was granted work
   release by the sheriff‚Äôs office, allowing him 12 hours a day, six days
   a week at his private office, as well as permitting regular trips to a
   chiropractor. While on work release, Epstein was supervised by off-duty
   deputies who were required to wear business suits, not uniforms. They
   were paid hourly by Epstein, according to work release records. Epstein
   also paid $84 per week to PBSO as a standard work release fee.

   The arrangement came to the attention of Assistant U.S. Attorney A.
   Marie Villafa√±a, who wasn‚Äôt pleased. On July 3, 2008, she wrote a
   letter to PBSO Deputy Chief Mike Gauger that letting Epstein spend time
   in a private office ‚Äúmaking telephone calls, web-surfing, and having
   food delivered to him is probably not in accordance with the objectives
   of imprisonment.‚Äù

   Villafa√±a noted that the situation seemed to violate PBSO‚Äôs own
   policies and asserted that the financier had misrepresented details
   about the made-to-order charity where he purportedly worked while on
   work release.

   Work release programs are meant to help inmates maintain their lives
   outside jail walls and reintegrate into society. But Epstein‚Äôs was
   loaded with perks.

BEHIND OUR REPORTING

Local Reporting Makes a Difference

   In her year-long investigation of Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey
   Epstein, Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown tracked down more than 60
   women who said they were victims of abuse and revealed the full story
   behind the sweetheart deal cut by Epstein‚Äôs powerhouse legal team.

   Since the Herald published ‚ÄòPerversion of Justice‚Äô in November 2018, a
   federal judge ruled the non-prosecution agreement brokered by then
   South Florida U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was illegal, Epstein was
   arrested on sex trafficking charges in New York state, Acosta resigned
   as U.S. Secretary of Labor, and Epstein killed himself in his Manhattan
   jail cell.

   The first version of Epstein‚Äôs work release agreement showed he was not
   to leave his workplace for any reason, ‚Äúwith the exception of returning
   to the PBSO stockade, or for emergency medical treatment.‚Äù Epstein, the
   document added, ‚Äúcannot leave for lunch.‚Äù

   But a revised version filed 13 days after he began his work release
   changed that language to read simply that Epstein could leave his place
   of employment ‚Äúonly if authorized by [PBSO‚Äôs] Alternative Custody
   Unit.‚Äù

   The alteration allowed Epstein to make at least 69 doctors‚Äô visits in
   six months, records show. Many of the trips were to a chiropractor in
   Lake Worth. Epstein would go as many as three times a week. Sometimes
   he would have more than two medical appointments the same day. He had
   so many appointments that off-duty deputies monitoring him had a hard
   time keeping them straight, the records show.

   The second draft of the work release agreement also changed how it
   referred to one of the stockade‚Äôs most notorious inmates ‚Äî from ‚Äúinmate
   Epstein‚Äù in the first draft to ‚ÄúJeffrey Epstein‚Äù in the rewrite.

   of Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs vast holdings. In the wake of his death in the
   Manhattan lockup, it is not clear what happens to this and other
   properties. Emily Michot emichot@miamiherald.com

   Why top officials at the law enforcement agency granted Epstein‚Äôs
   generous work release request isn‚Äôt clear. The decision was PBSO‚Äôs
   alone, the agency has said. The Herald has attempted to interview
   Bradshaw for a year to no avail.

   The work release agreement was negotiated with Epstein‚Äôs team of
   high-priced attorneys, led by Darren Indyke, who wrote the initial
   request on Epstein‚Äôs behalf and is also listed as the vice president of
   the foundation where Epstein worked during his release.

   ‚ÄúHis legal staff that he had was enormous,‚Äù Deputy Chief Gauger
   acknowledged during a video interview that the sheriff‚Äôs department
   posted online.

   In an Oct. 23, 2008, internal email discussing the changes to Epstein‚Äôs
   work release agreement, Lt. Steven Thibodeau wrote: ‚ÄúI realize that
   this permit is very unique; however, job profiles are often modified to
   satisfy the clients‚Äô needs or provide clarification. Considering the
   sensitivity of this permit, I would ask that you consider the proposed
   revised job profile.‚Äù

   Maj. Michael Veccia signed off, writing ‚Äúhave one of the Corrections
   Majors approve the changes.‚Äù

   Epstein paid the sheriff‚Äôs office more than $128,000 to cover the cost
   of deputies‚Äô supervising him off duty. Their rates began at $42 per
   hour, documents show.

   In a subsequent email from Villafa√±a, she told PBSO that the agency‚Äôs
   own policies on work release barred felons, like Epstein, who had
   committed at least three offenses under Florida‚Äôs anti-prostitution
   statute from going on work release.

   While Epstein‚Äôs attorneys argued that his conviction on a single count
   exempted him from the prohibition, Villafa√±a noted, ‚Äúin order to be
   convicted of a felony violation of that statute, one must commit ‚Äòa
   third or subsequent violation.‚Äô In other words, Mr. Epstein has
   committed at least three violations‚Äù and is therefore ineligible for
   work release.

   Villafa√±a also informed the sheriff‚Äôs office that elements of Epstein‚Äôs
   work release application seemed to be a sham. For instance, she wrote,
   Epstein had rarely worked for the West Palm Beach charity where he
   planned to spend his days while incarcerated, as he claimed in his
   application.

   In fact, the Florida Science Foundation was registered to operate in
   Florida not long before Epstein went to jail in 2008. And its officers,
   including Epstein‚Äôs ‚Äúsupervisor,‚Äù were paid attorneys working for
   Epstein, Villafa√±a said.

   ‚ÄúThe foundation, its offices, and Mr. Epstein‚Äôs purported job schedule
   were all created on the eve of Mr. Epstein‚Äôs incarceration in order to
   provide him with a basis for seeking work release,‚Äù Villafa√±a wrote.

   It‚Äôs not clear how the sheriff‚Äôs office responded to her concerns.
   (Villafa√±a, who herself signed off on the controversial non-prosecution
   agreement with Epstein that allowed him to escape a federal indictment
   in order to plead to lesser charges in state court, recently resigned
   her position with the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office.)

   The Florida Science Foundation was dissolved the year Epstein was
   released, state records show.
   Miami Herald inveestigative reporter Julie K. Brown and researcher
   Monika Leal contributed to this report.

   Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein has been a free man,
   despite sexually abusing dozens of underage girls according to police
   and prosecutors. His victims have never had a voice, until now. By

   A decade ago, during a brief stint in Palm Beach County Jail, convicted
   sex offender Jeffrey Epstein made an odd purchase at the facility‚Äôs
   store: two pairs of small women‚Äôs panties, size 5.

   It was just one of thousands of dollars of purchases made by the
   disgraced financier while in jail after pleading guilty in 2008 to
   soliciting a minor for sex, according to a purchase log. (His top
   purchase was single-serve cups of coffee, of which he bought more than
   800 in 13 months.) But the panties raise questions about why a
   childless male inmate, accused of sexually abusing girls as young as
   14, would be allowed to buy female undergarments so small that they
   wouldn‚Äôt fit an average-sized adult woman.

   The panties were certainly too small for Epstein, who also purchased
   his briefs in men‚Äôs medium and sweatshirts ranging from XL to 3XL, and
   size 12 shoes. So what, or who, were they for, and why wouldn‚Äôt the
   purchase raise eyebrows under the circumstances? It‚Äôs one of many
   questions that arise from thousands of pages of records obtained by the
   Miami Herald from the Palm Beach County Sheriff‚Äôs Office.

   The stockade held male and female inmates, separately, explaining why
   the panties were stocked.

   On Friday, the Palm Beach Sheriff‚Äôs Office, which runs the jail and
   stockade, handed out the records of his stay, during which he was
   allowed to leave the stockade in a chauffeur-driven car and deposited
   at a downtown West Palm Beach office building for a 12-hour-a-day,
   six-day-a-week respite from incarceration.

   The records came out too late Friday to get a comment from Sheriff Ric
   Bradshaw or his spokeswoman. Bradshaw has faced increasingly fierce
   criticism ‚Äî and his department is now under investigation by the
   Florida Department of Law Enforcement ‚Äî for its seemingly soft
   treatment of the multimillionaire hedge fund manager, who was,
   according to the records, allowed to wander in and out of his unlocked
   cell at will.

   That investigation is separate from the Justice Department probe
   looking at why then-federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta decided to
   shelve a 53-page sex trafficking indictment against Epstein, which
   could have put him away for life.

   Listen to today's top stories from the Miami Herald:

   And now there is yet another pending investigation, this one looking at
   how Epstein, rearrested at 66 in early July on renewed sex trafficking
   charges, was able to hang himself last Saturday in a New York City jail
   cell while awaiting trial. The new charges were filed after the Miami
   Herald published a series on Epstein‚Äôs 10-year-old case, Perversion of
   Justice, that examined, among other things, Acosta‚Äôs decision to give
   in to a defense demand that victims not be told about the earlier
   federal charges being dropped.

   The Manhattan cell where he took his own life ‚Äî in a hardscrabble
   lockup notorious for bugs, rodents and rough jail mates ‚Äî was a stark
   contrast to his surroundings in Palm Beach County in 2008.

   What‚Äôs clear from the Palm Beach sheriff‚Äôs records is that Epstein‚Äôs
   wealth provided him extraordinary privileges during his 13-month stay
   in the Palm Beach stockade from June 30, 2008, to July 22, 2009 ‚Äî an
   unlocked cell door, almost unlimited access to a TV, and a perhaps
   uniquely generous work release program that meant he spent almost as
   much time outside the jail as in it.

   The longer he stayed, the cushier things got. Six-day-a-week work
   release was extended to seven. Hours outside the cell were extended
   from 12 to 16. He was permitted to pass some of the time at home.
   Records that once referred to him as an inmate now called him ‚Äúclient.‚Äù

   Deputies, required to wear business suits, provided ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù for
   Epstein while he was on work release. They guarded the door to his
   office or home, sometimes from the outside, rather than keeping an eye
   directly on Epstein, while the inmate was on structured leave from the
   jail. Some deputies expressed relief in their daily reports that he
   seemed pleased with services rendered.

   The records from Palm Beach suggest the local sheriff‚Äôs office never
   intended to treat the convicted sex offender as a typical inmate ‚Äî
   explicitly because of his extraordinary wealth.

   In an email on the day Epstein reported to jail, Capt. Mark Chamberlain
   wrote that the new inmate was a person of ‚Äúunusual means‚Äù and expressed
   concerns that other prisoners might try to extort or manipulate him.

   ‚ÄúHis financial status lends itself to his being victimized while in
   custody and as such, he has been placed in special management,‚Äù
   Chamberlain wrote. ‚ÄúHe is poorly versed in jail routine and society and
   his adjustment to incarceration will most likely be atypical. For the
   time being, I am authorizing that his cell door be left unlocked and he
   be given liberal access to the attorney room where a TV will be
   installed.‚Äù

   All this while serving time for soliciting sex with a minor ‚Äî a charge
   Epstein agreed to plead guilty to only after Acosta, then the U.S.
   attorney for Southern Florida, killed an already drafted
   sex-trafficking indictment that could have put him away for life.

   During his stint in Palm Beach County custody, Epstein was required to
   be physically present in the jail for about 60 percent of the time
   during the 13 months he served, far less time than originally reported
   by PBSO when questioned by the Miami Herald and other media outlets.
   According to calculations based on internal emails describing his work
   release, Epstein was approved to spend over 40 percent of the time at
   his office, at home, or at a variety of doctor appointments.

   Bradley Edwards, an attorney for some of the women who accuse Epstein
   of having recruiters lure girls to his Palm Beach estate for massages
   that turned into sexual assaults, has alleged that Epstein used his
   work release hours to engage in sexual exploits behind closed doors. A
   release of court records earlier this month quoted a young female
   college student allegedly recruited by Epstein‚Äôs associates saying he
   required ‚Äúthree orgasms a day‚Äù to function. ‚ÄúIt was biological. Like
   eating,‚Äù she said Epstein told her.

   The record of who visited Epstein while on work release ‚Äî a daily log
   maintained by deputies and tucked away in a safe ‚Äî has been destroyed.
   Explaining that decision, the sheriff‚Äôs office cited legally prescribed
   retention schedules that allowed for the book‚Äôs destruction. But many
   records from that time remain for investigators to examine, including
   the thousands of pages of just released records.

   The records provided Friday list every deputy assigned as plainclothes
   ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù for Epstein during his work release. The deputies, paid for
   by Epstein, are potential witnesses in what is an ongoing Florida FDLE
   investigation of Epstein‚Äôs treatment by PBSO and its longtime sheriff,
   Bradshaw.

   Purchase records from the jail‚Äôs commissary are a reflection of the
   hedge fund manager‚Äôs eclectic personal habits, which included an
   insatiable sweet tooth, and a focus on physical appearance and personal
   hygiene. The prisoner‚Äôs purchases, $2,000 worth in all, included
   hundreds of snacks, from large Hershey‚Äôs almond bars to Sour Cheddar
   Ruffles, hair gel, seven bottles of shampoo, and 22 tubes of
   toothpaste.

   Early during his jail stretch, one of Epstein‚Äôs paralegals was caught
   bringing Epstein a book titled ‚ÄúFace Exercises that Prevent Premature
   Aging.‚Äù Someone also smuggled in more hygiene products, including three
   additional tubes of toothpaste ‚Äî brands that weren‚Äôt available on the
   jail shelves. All of that was confiscated as contraband, records show.

   After three and a half months in the stockade, Epstein was granted work
   release by the sheriff‚Äôs office, allowing him 12 hours a day, six days
   a week at his private office, as well as permitting regular trips to a
   chiropractor. While on work release, Epstein was supervised by off-duty
   deputies who were required to wear business suits, not uniforms. They
   were paid hourly by Epstein, according to work release records. Epstein
   also paid $84 per week to PBSO as a standard work release fee.

   The arrangement came to the attention of Assistant U.S. Attorney A.
   Marie Villafa√±a, who wasn‚Äôt pleased. On July 3, 2008, she wrote a
   letter to PBSO Deputy Chief Mike Gauger that letting Epstein spend time
   in a private office ‚Äúmaking telephone calls, web-surfing, and having
   food delivered to him is probably not in accordance with the objectives
   of imprisonment.‚Äù

   Villafa√±a noted that the situation seemed to violate PBSO‚Äôs own
   policies and asserted that the financier had misrepresented details
   about the made-to-order charity where he purportedly worked while on
   work release.

   Work release programs are meant to help inmates maintain their lives
   outside jail walls and reintegrate into society. But Epstein‚Äôs was
   loaded with perks.

BEHIND OUR REPORTING

Local Reporting Makes a Difference

   In her year-long investigation of Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey
   Epstein, Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown tracked down more than 60
   women who said they were victims of abuse and revealed the full story
   behind the sweetheart deal cut by Epstein‚Äôs powerhouse legal team.

   Since the Herald published ‚ÄòPerversion of Justice‚Äô in November 2018, a
   federal judge ruled the non-prosecution agreement brokered by then
   South Florida U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was illegal, Epstein was
   arrested on sex trafficking charges in New York state, Acosta resigned
   as U.S. Secretary of Labor, and Epstein killed himself in his Manhattan
   jail cell.

   The first version of Epstein‚Äôs work release agreement showed he was not
   to leave his workplace for any reason, ‚Äúwith the exception of returning
   to the PBSO stockade, or for emergency medical treatment.‚Äù Epstein, the
   document added, ‚Äúcannot leave for lunch.‚Äù

   But a revised version filed 13 days after he began his work release
   changed that language to read simply that Epstein could leave his place
   of employment ‚Äúonly if authorized by [PBSO‚Äôs] Alternative Custody
   Unit.‚Äù

   The alteration allowed Epstein to make at least 69 doctors‚Äô visits in
   six months, records show. Many of the trips were to a chiropractor in
   Lake Worth. Epstein would go as many as three times a week. Sometimes
   he would have more than two medical appointments the same day. He had
   so many appointments that off-duty deputies monitoring him had a hard
   time keeping them straight, the records show.

   The second draft of the work release agreement also changed how it
   referred to one of the stockade‚Äôs most notorious inmates ‚Äî from ‚Äúinmate
   Epstein‚Äù in the first draft to ‚ÄúJeffrey Epstein‚Äù in the rewrite.

   of Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs vast holdings. In the wake of his death in the
   Manhattan lockup, it is not clear what happens to this and other
   properties. Emily Michot emichot@miamiherald.com

   Why top officials at the law enforcement agency granted Epstein‚Äôs
   generous work release request isn‚Äôt clear. The decision was PBSO‚Äôs
   alone, the agency has said. The Herald has attempted to interview
   Bradshaw for a year to no avail.

   The work release agreement was negotiated with Epstein‚Äôs team of
   high-priced attorneys, led by Darren Indyke, who wrote the initial
   request on Epstein‚Äôs behalf and is also listed as the vice president of
   the foundation where Epstein worked during his release.

   ‚ÄúHis legal staff that he had was enormous,‚Äù Deputy Chief Gauger
   acknowledged during a video interview that the sheriff‚Äôs department
   posted online.

   In an Oct. 23, 2008, internal email discussing the changes to Epstein‚Äôs
   work release agreement, Lt. Steven Thibodeau wrote: ‚ÄúI realize that
   this permit is very unique; however, job profiles are often modified to
   satisfy the clients‚Äô needs or provide clarification. Considering the
   sensitivity of this permit, I would ask that you consider the proposed
   revised job profile.‚Äù

   Maj. Michael Veccia signed off, writing ‚Äúhave one of the Corrections
   Majors approve the changes.‚Äù

   Epstein paid the sheriff‚Äôs office more than $128,000 to cover the cost
   of deputies‚Äô supervising him off duty. Their rates began at $42 per
   hour, documents show.

   In a subsequent email from Villafa√±a, she told PBSO that the agency‚Äôs
   own policies on work release barred felons, like Epstein, who had
   committed at least three offenses under Florida‚Äôs anti-prostitution
   statute from going on work release.

   While Epstein‚Äôs attorneys argued that his conviction on a single count
   exempted him from the prohibition, Villafa√±a noted, ‚Äúin order to be
   convicted of a felony violation of that statute, one must commit ‚Äòa
   third or subsequent violation.‚Äô In other words, Mr. Epstein has
   committed at least three violations‚Äù and is therefore ineligible for
   work release.

   Villafa√±a also informed the sheriff‚Äôs office that elements of Epstein‚Äôs
   work release application seemed to be a sham. For instance, she wrote,
   Epstein had rarely worked for the West Palm Beach charity where he
   planned to spend his days while incarcerated, as he claimed in his
   application.

   In fact, the Florida Science Foundation was registered to operate in
   Florida not long before Epstein went to jail in 2008. And its officers,
   including Epstein‚Äôs ‚Äúsupervisor,‚Äù were paid attorneys working for
   Epstein, Villafa√±a said.

   ‚ÄúThe foundation, its offices, and Mr. Epstein‚Äôs purported job schedule
   were all created on the eve of Mr. Epstein‚Äôs incarceration in order to
   provide him with a basis for seeking work release,‚Äù Villafa√±a wrote.

   It‚Äôs not clear how the sheriff‚Äôs office responded to her concerns.
   (Villafa√±a, who herself signed off on the controversial non-prosecution
   agreement with Epstein that allowed him to escape a federal indictment
   in order to plead to lesser charges in state court, recently resigned
   her position with the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office.)

   The Florida Science Foundation was dissolved the year Epstein was
   released, state records show.
   Miami Herald inveestigative reporter Julie K. Brown and researcher
   Monika Leal contributed to this report.
